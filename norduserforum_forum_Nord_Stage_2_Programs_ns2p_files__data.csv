Seeing that the synth in this song is a chromatic synth sweep, I see why this iPad app makes sense.  My only challenge was getting the iPad to go into my sound system.So I went with the iRig 2 as a midi option.  However, I just bought a little mixer where I can stereo input my two Nord keyboards, and there's a 3rd input for my iPad.  Then I have one output  for the PA, jam hub, or wherever I'm plugging it into.My only thing now is to program the right sound in the Morphwiz but I think with trial and error I'll be able to come up with something close.  If anyone wants to share how they programmed the morphwhiz sounds for this, of course that'd save me time. But I'm in much better shape since my last post.MrSitcom - give Morphwhiz a try, pretty cool and I can see a lot of other ways I can use it.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=52854&sid=3bafa18b397b6951021e1bbb44abd0aa#p52854

It uses three splits. I don't know how effective this will be in live performance because the parts are syncopated in a way that makes it difficult to play accurately.At any rate, the lowest split is the low rhythmic part that provides the song's pulse. This part is heard throughout except in the short little vocal and drum breaks.The middle split is the big riff synth for the chorus.The top split is for the bleepy blippy melody that occurs throughout. It's made with a clav and Farfisa. It's not perfect, but it's close.The lowest split would sound better if sequenced, but because of the breaks, this would be basically ""playing to tracks."" I plan to play the low pulse in the verses and the heavy riff in the chorus, skipping the low split part in the chorus.

I accurate brought in the specifications. But is wasn't the same sound. Far from it. Where did it went wrong? In the end I asked WannitBBBad to help me. His first remark was that the information sheet for the Stage 2 program indicated ""Skip Samp Atk"" for both synths what don’t occurred on the Stage 3 sheet. I must try adding the Fast Sample Attack (hold shift/exit button down while selecting the Attack option) to both synths. What I did, but it still didn't look like the original. Then I started all over again. And I create “Atemlos HFischer.ns3f”(Patch with Arpeggiator)and “Atemlos2HFischer.ns3f”(Patch without Arpeggiator).WannitBBBad’s reponse was as follows:I took your program ""Atemlos2HFischer.ns3f"" and modified it to give you a little more flexibility on the sound:a.	The Pad level is morphed to the Mod Wheel and backs down a little with the Control Pedal still like you programmed it.b.	The String level is morphed to the Control Pedal along with a DX7 piano and OSC2 to add a tone an octave higher than the strings when turned upc.	The String FREQ is morphed to the Control Pedal so it starts out muted and gets brighter with the Control Pedal.You may need to re-link the Samples after loading the program. I have the program attached with ""W"" at the end of the name so you know which one I sent.I downloaded the modified program (and indeed relinked the samples). It gives an extra dimension to the sound. Great. I also modified “Atemlos HFischer”(Arp) to “Atemlos HFisch1W”(no Arp).I had also previously asked in the public forum about the sound from bar 24. It wasn’t created for the Stage 2.WannitBBBad came up with the program “HF Atemlos 2 W.ns3f” for the second part of the Helene Fischer song at 00:45 in the video. Lacking better percussive sounds, I downloaded a small steel drum sample to use along with strings and use the control pedal to increase the FREQ and a couple levels. The program  is made so at the end the right hand is playing octaves across the split.It sounds great!Here are the results.Atemlos(2)HFischer.mp3Atemlos(2)HFisch1W.mp3HF Atemlos W 2.mp3Atemlos HFischer.ns3fPatch with Arpeggiator(592 Bytes) Downloaded 285 timesAtemlos2HFischer.ns3fPatch without Arpeggiator(592 Bytes) Downloaded 263 timesAtemlos HFisch1W.ns3fPatch with Arpeggiator(592 Bytes) Downloaded 258 timesAtemlos2HFisch1W.ns3fPatch without Arpeggiator(592 Bytes) Downloaded 268 timesHF Atemlos 2 W.ns3fSound after 00:45 s(592 Bytes) Downloaded 283 timesOrchStrings Marc HiVib_KH 3.0.nsmp3(4.29 MiB) Downloaded 277 timesPAD 4 - Synth brass(151).nsmp3[/attachment

They appear on the keyboard, but the left split doesn't appear on patch 1, nor does the right split on patch 2 (which is the main riff, so is a bit disappointing).

But I think it's the same as sample 52 (DXPiano_ste_PH) in the Nord Stage 2’s factory settings.  So just set the synth in Slot A to sample 52 and the program works fine.I also noticed that after installation, these three programs weren’t displayed in Nord Sound Manager v6.18.  That is, not until I removed the first underline in each program’s name (using the NS2’s Store As… button.) That made all the underlines in the name disappear, and after saving the program’s new name, the program displays correctly in the Sound Manager’s program list.

It also can be used for the D-G stab during the verses.  Slot B is the synth pad during the chorus.The second patch is the take-off effect.  I would program it next door to the first one, as it has to be a quick switch.  Hit A-E in the second octave, hold it down and then the same two notes three octaves above. It will last exactly as long as the second part of the chorus and will end right before the synth riff comes in again.Enjoy!-dj",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=32916&sid=3bafa18b397b6951021e1bbb44abd0aa#p32916

With quite a few synth sounds in this song, I took a different approach for this one and did all my programming with the purpose of making the NSMP sample.  The ""whistle"" sound was created using a sine wave in Mono mode with slight vibrato, but the glide to quickly go between the two notes had to be manually changed to be slower for the last glide down when I recorded it.  The sample editor provided the fade out. As there was vibrato on two of the synths, I sampled each key played in the song so that the vibrato rate would be the same for each note.  Interpolation is great for a lot of sounds but it changes the rate of attack, decay, and other time-related aspects of a sound. The DX7 is the ""DX7IIC FineTines_BR mono"" sample (available on the Nord site) with overdrive applied. The horns at the end are a combination of ""Brass Section Pop 1_BR"" and ""Brass Ensemble 2_KG"". On the MP3 I play along with the sampled drum intro, but the looped drum track is also included for reference in the NSMP sample. No effects are used for the MP3 except reverb. I played around with the levels to get them fairly close for performance but the Amp Velocity on the Stage 2 can be used to provide more flexibility in the levels if needed.

You are too kind. IDK, I made alot of mistakes when playing, but I didn't want to spend too much time, it was just to demonstrateHmm. I don't understand why you could not do this on the NSEX? Of course you can not play strings from samples, but maybe it could be doable with synthstrings. But then again it would not sound the same, and I guess in this song real strings is a must.But you have both a NSEX and a NE3 as far as I know, so you could do the song with both of them.

I have made some slight changes to these that you may be interested in:1. Gated the synth in the first patch using a tremolo with tempo set against MST CLK (as I now use a midi clock foot switch).2. Added a ping pong delay to the synth in the first patch again tempo set by MST CLK3. Added a heavily overdriven organ with same tremolo gate and a phaser for the chorus patch (left hand) as I notice the same synth sound for the verse is used in the chorus, but both synth slots are already in use for the split strings.4. Replaced Firework 3 with a copy of Firework 1 - only difference being that I opened the tremolo up a lot more to make it a bit more 'paddy'.  This way I can get a smooth patch change out of the mid 8 into the bridge before the final chorus5. Added compression - with that much going on, don't want to overwhelm the mix.My patches an sample mp3 attached.

Get a count from the drummer and tap it in (I will be tapping 2 and 4 throughout the song to keep in with the stick man)2. Hold the chords for the main synth sound and let the tremelo do the work3. Just before the strings part kicks in, I hold the synth on that C#Maj7add9 using the sustain and flick over to slot B to make the transition as smooth as possible4. Play the staccato string part 4 times5. Now this bit is tricky!  Just at the end of the 4th time round with the staccato, we are heading into the bridge (or pre-chorus if you like).  Here, I combine Slots A and B then use the sostenuto pedal on the 1st beat of every bar so that I can keep the synth going with the first chord without sustaining all the incidental notes in between.  Trick is to keep the staccato going but trust the sostenuto pedal to keep the tremelo synth line going.6. Heading into the Chorus itself, I switch to Firework2 and use the sustain pedal for the left hand strings/distorted organ sound.  The right hand continues the staccato line7. For the Mid8 section, I'm using Firework3 and holding the chords.  Nothing special here, again I use the sustain pedal on the last chord (Eb from memory) and change to slot B for the bridge8.

To get the tremolo effect on the Nord, I passed it through the on board effects section as this allows me to bind the tremolo tempo to the Master Clock (handy in a live situation as the tempo can be tapped / re-tapped).  Some synths provide LFO on the Amp section so you can get a similar effect there but whether you can easily adjust the tempo on the fly is a different matterBridge (1st verse)This is just a hard attack strings sound.  Layering a good strong pizzicato might be nice here here - I couldn't find one that really cut through the mix in the way I wanted so I opted for the String Orchestra from the Mellotron library.  There's bound to be a handful of reasonable String samples on the Korg that would fit the bill.Bridge (2nd + 3rd versesWhere in the first bridge we just have strings, the later bridges have everything going on.  With the Nord, I combine the string sound for the 1st bridge with the Intro / Verse sounds.  Notice on the video I roll the wheel up?  This is actually bound to to the tremolo effect so that it becomes less aggressive.ChorusIn the right hand is a strong hard attacking string sound - I used the same as I used for the bridge.In the left hand I have a layer of the strings used in the right (but at a lower volume).  Here I hit a limitation with the Nord, Ideally, I would have taken the square wave sound from the Intro and layered it over the strings in the left hand.  However I needed the strings in the left hand to be quieter than the right otherwise the chords would overwhelm the staccato in the right hand.  So, I 'approximated' a similar sound by using the organ section:- Farfisa - Off, Off, On, On, On, Off, Off, Off, Off, leslie sim on slightly overdriven- This is fed through the Tremelo effect (bound to the master clock) and then through a small amp simulator to lose excessive bottom end and make it sound a bit more 'synth'.With your Korg, I expect you will have the flexibility to just use the square wave from the Intro, but I thought I'd explain this as others may find it interesting.That's it.  Sorry I can't give you a file that sorts this all out for you, maybe you could just buy a NS2?  FWIW, I also now own a Korg Kronos and the one thing that limits it is the inability to easily share programs in the same way as we can here.  Korg really need to sort this out.Anyway, good luck and please let me know how you get on.  If you have any questions on the above (like if I missed something), please let me know!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=61851&sid=3bafa18b397b6951021e1bbb44abd0aa#p61851

Even if I put the amount of the phaser on very low. So I left it out.I also made a Youtube Video playing the whole song and I have written the sheet music of the keyboard part exactly the way I am playing it in the Video and live with my Band. When you're interested in the sheet music send me an Email tokeyboardparts@gmail.comand I can send you the sheet music as .pdf or Sibelius file.I hope you like it.

The studio version of the song is clearly a Wurlitzer.  [Edit):  Tasten-Bert and (""Clearly"") I were both wrong.... It's a Hohner Pianet.....The OP's question made me think again about how much time I spend trying to find the closest possible match to a keyboard part's sound on a recording.  Consider this; Burton Cummings, who wrote, sang and played the ""keyboard"" on These Eyes, wasn't all that interested in reproducing the sound of that studio's Wurlitzer when when performed the song after it was released.  Here's evidence of that:  He's playing a grand piano on the TV show Midnight Special.I suspect that - in most cases - my time is better spent getting the left hand part, the phrasing and the feel of songs correct than getting the patches exactly like some recording of the sound.

The studio version of the song is clearly a Wurlitzer.  The OP's question made me think again about how much time I spend trying to find the closest possible match to a keyboard part's sound on a recording.  Consider this; Burton Cummings, who wrote, sang and played the ""keyboard"" on These Eyes, wasn't all that interested in reproducing the sound of that studio's Wurlitzer when he performed the song after it was released.  Here's evidence of that:  He's playing a grand piano on the TV show Midnight Special.I suspect that - in most cases - my time is better spent getting the left hand part, the phrasing and the feel of songs correct than getting the patches exactly like some recording of the sound.

I don't have my NS2 hooked up to the computer very often and I was off at NAMM for the better part of a week. I'm attaching my Rebel Yell sounds as bundles so you can get the full content. I don't have a good way to create MP3s of these, but I'll try to explain how they are set up.Rebel Yell 1 is for the intro sound (which repeats in the middle of the song just before the guitar solo). I have a CP80 and D-50 percussive sample layered together and I think it sounds pretty close to the original recording.Rebel Yell 2 has an organ sound on the lower part of the keyboard that I use as for chords during the verse and chorus (switch to Preset II for chorus to get a fuller organ sound). The upper part of the split has a layered synth sound that I use for the high part during the verse and also for the synth lead towards the end of the song, while droning organ with my left hand. Please note that I use a Vent for my organ sounds, so I have the output for organ routed to Output 3. If you're using the internal sim, you'll just need to edit this parameter.I just figured out that the bundle sound for Rebel Yell 1 is too large to upload, so I'll try to figure out a different way to post it (perhaps as just the sound vs. a bundle).",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=68621&sid=a0017ea4d5f83e8635fa957d41ae1bb7#p68621

Note that most of my programs use the control pedal morph even if only to bring instruments in and out of a mix. You may need some additional samples for some of the programs.The memory locations in my Nord Stage 2 EX for the samples used in the program are:Slot A - 142 - ""Harmonica__DV mono 2.0""Slot B - 115 - ""Steel Guitar_Finger_DV mono 2.0""I believe these samples are preloaded in the locations given for a Stage 2 EX.  If you have to load them, it doesn't matter which sample memory locations you store the new samples in your Nord Stage 2, just make sure that after you load a program, that you point the Slot A and/or Slot B Synth to the correct sample in your system. For example, if you load ""Harmonica__DV mono 2.0"" into your sample location 140 (142 in mine), then you just need to point Slot A to 140 rather than 142.

Back in 2016, for a gig, I decided to program the song Hella Good (No Doubt) for Nord Stage 2.The program is generally speaking to play the song as loops on Voice Mode Mono with the Left Hand -mostly 4/4 bars- and have freedom to add the details with the RH.On a technical note, the bar samples allow the band to avoid using a Backing Track, having total freedom to interact with the audience and continue the song regardless if there any perfomance mistakes. To blend each note, the program uses voice mode mono, decay at 10, almost no release, attack at 0, HP at 0, an extra quarter note on each bar sample, and a subtle analog delay close to quarter note triplets.The Nord program does NOT use samples from the song. It was fully done by imitating the sounds using synths from the Nord Library, and altering those synths with the Nord Stage 2 and DAW.The program is at 115BPM.The .zip file contains the WAV Samples, Nord Projects, Nord Samples and the Nord Program.Here is a video performing the song, to demonstrate the program functionality:Cheers!HellaGood.mp3",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=157588&sid=a0017ea4d5f83e8635fa957d41ae1bb7#p157588

With iMovie you can just drag a transition or title you like over the video stream and in the immortal words of Steve Jobs: 'Boom'.This takes about 10 minutes or so to get a project ready to export.Only thing left is to render and export the complete movie. iMovie can export direct to YouTube, however I tend to do a session at a time where I record 4-5 of these so I always have a few in the bank in case I'm too busy to get something out on time. I'm putting one video out per week.The only challenge I had was syncing the audio up. My less than scientific approach was simply to click a count with one hand before starting to play.

I know that the Synth section is identical on the Stage 2 EX, and although there are some differences on the Stage and Stage EX, it may still be relevant. Hey, even may have some relevance to NLA1 owners...If you don't know what FM is, think of any popular song from 1983 to the end of the eighties across practically all genres and you will remember those iconic synth sounds... that's FM.It's baffling at first - especially because a lot of the existing tutorials focus on subtractive ('analog') synthesis and then add a throwaway comment about FM as if it's either of no interest, or so easy you can figure it out... so i'm willing to share some FM how-to tutorials if there is any appetite for this? I'm no guru - for sure there's a bunch of old synth-heads on this forum who know this stuff inside-out and backwards, but may not have as much time to spare as meIf you aren't using the FM synth on your Stage then you have an amazing synth engine which is wastedIf you own/previously owned a DX7 (or one of its kin), then you probably took one look at the FM capabilties on the Stage and murmured ""Meh."" before moving on. You did it an injustice...If you are a synth head and know this stuff inside out and backwards, you can correct my errors!The best thing about Synth sounds (as opposed to samples) is that they are more capable of expressive control, take up practically no space in memory, and allow you the freedom to create completely new sounds on the fly without relying on hooking up to your laptop. Also they can't be used by Electro owners, so you can feel more comfortable in why you splurged out extra $$$ for a Stage and not an Electro.Anyway, let me know and I will post some how-to stuff.

Keep it.I rebuilt the piano and the bass part. With a running oscilloscope I saw what each step changes on the sound. I like the hints after the bass part “More things to try”. It tempts to try out other things without “destroy” the sound. Make similar hints in the future for other sounds.When somebody would only make the bass part the first step miss the step of “Make sure the FM synth is selected”. Make the first 2 steps of each sound always the same, this would allow people to rebuild only that particular sound on its own later on.Starting with FM synthesis together with the oscilloscope I can clear see and understand synthesis because each step adds somethings to the sound. Meaning the sound is rising up.Maybe starting with FM synthesis and then going on to the subtractive synthesis is a better way to learn understant synthesizer.The hint about copy slots was very helpful (I didn’t know that). Intersperse such hints in the future.If you have time: An explanation what harmonics are would be maybe helpful (add frequencies with an octave distance).

I feel ashamed not to have delivered on my promises, but life gets in the wayI figured I should respond here...I haven't touched that guide in about 4 years. I got some great feedback, but I also found it took a lot more work than I originally anticipated, doing screenshots of waveforms, creating recordings, and working through step-by-step recipes.Then I figured I should probably generalise it, something that doesn't just apply to the NS2, otherwise it's quite a bit of effort for a limited audience (even if it is an audience with great taste in gearSo part of it turned into a general synth book - which is still a work in progress - kind of a back-burner project.I also spent too much time being distracted by forums, and not enough time actually 'doing' - after a few troll experiences i stepped away.TBH my workflow has changed a bit - I was impressed by the NS2 for the first year - ""new gear syndrome"", but ultimately I found the synth section pretty limited and stopped using it in favour of other hardware. The NS2 makes a great controller, and that's what I mainly use it as - I only use the piano section and Hammond sim as actual sound sources.

What parameters have changed and how ... so that even I can understand how to work on certain sounds! Thank you very much!Milord, I'm glad you like the sound. I don't have the time to go in details, it's basically a detuned (root + fifth, 7 hafltones above) saw sound if I remember it correctly, don't have my NS2 here right now.  Add a lowpass filter with resonance controlled by envelope, and some velocity sensitivity for the filter and the envelope. That's about iYou can see every paramter I changed in the display if you press ""SHIFT"" plus the knob you want to know the value of. Doing this you can set all the knobs to their actaul position and learn how they change the sound.By the way, the synth part of the original track is almost panned hard to one channel (the right one?), so by only listening to this one channel of the stereo recording you can hear the original sound nearly alone without guitars, drums etc. -  this really helps finding the right sound.Alex",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=21668&sid=a0017ea4d5f83e8635fa957d41ae1bb7#p21668

I will share them in this topic, one for each post.Recommendations:1- these sounds were programmed on a NS2 88 HA: if you're using a 76 HP or 73 SW, you will sometimes run out of space for the splits, and/or you will have to adapt them.2- most (maybe all) of the non-piano sounds make extensive use of morphs, always for volume and sometimes for several parameters. Make sure you have a control pedal connected!3- we played 1 semitone lower to give the singers some breath. If you want to play in the original key, don't forget to turn off the Transpose button!4- these sounds were programmed to be played in a full tribute band (we learned the parts note from note from the Sacred White Book with all Beatles' songs), with 2 guitars covering the original guitar parts and sometimes a second keyboard player for the most complex songs. So, no shortcuts! If you need a ""generic"" beatles patch that will allow you to go through a song without a full band, you will not find it here, sorry!5- All the files are in .ns2p format, you will see the necessary pianos and samples once loaded in the Nord Sound Manager or even better, using the great program viewer app created by our fellow forum member florence (nord-stage-forum-f3/ns3-program-viewer-t19939.html). Anyway, if there is some obscure sample that you cannot find, just ask!I'm not uploading mp3 demos because all pianos and samples are standard ones found in the main Clavia website or here in the forum/nordusersounds.I only used this one file of sound effects I made myself (Jet plane for Back in the USSR, bubbles for Octopus' Garden, and various claps and cowbells), to be used in a split configuration on the bottom part of the keyboard. There are sounds only on some white keys, the others (and all blacks) only have silence, to minimize the risk of hitting the wrong sound. C1-D1-E1= 3 different claps (sound best when played all together, to give the sense of a clapping group).

Yes we had a fairly active tribute for a few years, and we put in a lot of work on the sounds and vocals.The jet sound for Back in the USSR is in the sample I uploaded in the first post. It's a ""utility"" sample I made by combining various sounds (claps, bells, jet planes, octopus bubbles...) on single keys in the lowest split zone, separately by silent keys to minimize the risk of hitting the wrong sound. So basically you have all the keyboard to play say, piano, and just reach out to the bottom left when you need a sound effect.Anyway, I will post the specific program for BITUSSR, where the sample is looped using the Hold function.>>> EDIT: Back in the USSR is already posted: it used the same ""piano+sound fx"" program that I uploaded in the 2nd post, the same as for I want to Hold Your Hand etc.The jet plane will loop forever and should be more or less in time with the song (honestly it doesn't matter much if it's not perfectly in sync). To stop it, either turn off the Hold function, hit any of the ""silent keys"" of the sample, or simply lift the control pedal to silence the sound until you move to the next song. I edited the first and second post accordingly, to better clarify how to use the sample/program.For Birthday, the sounds are there in the program I posted.

I had my doubts, but thought i'd give it a go.The results are more ""Radio BooHoo"" than ""Radio GaGa""! But as always, you can get something usable with the NS2.First off - no samples. That's cheating!I tried to reverse engineer the sound and decided to use a square LFO to modulate the cutoff frequency on a staccato synth with the arpeggiator latched on.It works surprisingly well, but I discovered a big drawback with the NS2 synth - you can't reset the LFO when you press a key - it just runs.(EDIT: I added an item to the NS2 wishlist if you want more detail on this.nord-stage-forum-f3/ns2-wish-list-somet ... tml#p52622)Anyway, with both the arp and the LFO synced to the master clock running around 104BPM it's ok.If you Tweak the Frequency knob up to 12 oclock, and the Freq 1 (LFO mod) down a bit and Freq 2 (Mod env) betwen 12 and 3pm, you can mess with the arp and see how the LFO does its thing. (you can hear the results of some of this in the MP3) To any synthnoobsbeginners out there, i am willing to go into more detail on this kind of thing, but in another postI put this in Slot A and mapped it to the Lower part of the keyboard (Try F1 - i think the song is in Fmajor), and then tweaked a kindof generic pad I made for something else in Slot B, and added a Piano slot for a bit of attack (I used the Yamaha Studio Grand i think), I don't like the results myself, but I thought i'd post it anyway.Personally I would probably use another synth to handle the arpeggio and go for a fatter, fuller sound on the NS2 using both synth slots.As usual the disclaimer: this is not a demo of great playing, nor is it meant to be a fully authentic patch. Just an education in tweaking the synth.Radio_BooHoo.mp3EDIT:DO NOT GET THE PATCH FROM THIS POST!- it was just a quick first attempt.

(so use an external midi synth).The arpeggio is on Slot A. I'm not messing with the volume to make it cut-out, that's the square wave LFO.To get the effect, start with the filter (Freq knob) at it's far left position, and the LFO (Freq Mod 1 knob) at about 7. Then sweep up the filter slowly to about 2 O'clock, you might want to simultaneously bring the LFO knob anti-clockwise a little if you are feeling dexterous! If it was an encoder instead of a pot, you could do both with a morph, but there we are. You could still map the filter to the Mod Wheel though, if you prefer.Edit: ideally you wouldn't want to start with the bottom F piano note. If I was performing, I might start the arpeggio with the volume down, then bring it up.Due to the fact that the arp does not key sync, it might be hard to get it in time with the drum beat, but it doesn't seem to matter too much if it's a little off.Radio GaGa - better.mp3It's still only good enough for a pub gig",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=52721&sid=a0017ea4d5f83e8635fa957d41ae1bb7#p52721

For folks interested in a Stage 3 version, I just posted a program atLINK -->nord-stage-3-programs-ns3p-ns3pb-files- ... 22251.htmlIn case you want to add to your program, I split the keyboard at C5, placed the intro piano and LFO synth on the right, and placed a Rhodes (EP3 Shallow Close Sml 6.0) and analog strings on the left. Morphed to the control pedal, the Rhodes level drops to zero as the analog strings level is brought from zero.  The analog strings on the left are set up so at the end of the song the user can select Mono to change the strings to a solo synth with glide and with the LFO amount on AfterTouch.

Some people made some good patches with samples, but that doesn't cut the mustard for me - firstly because they immediately give themselves away as samples when you play at anything other than the root pitch, and secondly because I avoid samples where possible out of sheer old-school prejudice!There are some great patches for the NS2 for the multi-layered chords, but they use both slots, so no good for the lead if you only have one board.So i used the B3 organ to supplement a detuned saw with chorus, LFO instead of phaser and the results are pretty OK IMHO.That left slot A free for my nice Moog synth lead.Anyway, there's my justification for revisiting old ground out of the way, and here's the patch.Performance tips:- The Mod Wheel is set up as a morph to control the levels of Synth B and Organ together, so you can do the fade-in at the beginning of part 1- The Preset II button in the organ section switches to a slightly different organ - you can add adjust 8th drawbaw while playing, to add that high G which is hard to reach- Sustain pedal will sustain the chords but not the lead, so you can change chords more seamlessly- Lead Moog synth has aftertouch vibrato, (although Richard Wright probably used mod wheel for that originally).- Recommend tweaking the main FREQ knob and the amp drive on the lead synth (slot A) to get the brightness to your liking.Shine_On_2.mp3",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=53205&sid=a0017ea4d5f83e8635fa957d41ae1bb7#p53205

Also, there is no sample involved in this NS2 program.  It would technically be possible to physically sample those sounds and create a composite .nsmp file containing each sound element, but that would be quite a lot of work and would yield a result which wasn't useable anyway.  The sustain pedal needed to latch the arpeggio would mess up the organ and piano parts.Some ideas are simply not practical, even if/when they might technically be possible or very nearly so.  Ultimately, it's just not going to be possible to trick your Electro 4 into pretending that it's a Stage 2.  If you have a dual keyboard setup, you might be able to figure out a way to attack this by assigning some portion(s) to one kbd and have the other cover the remainder.Easiest solution would be to get an NS2 though.Bless,Pablo",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=41864&sid=a0017ea4d5f83e8635fa957d41ae1bb7#p41864

I no longer have a Stage 2 to put together a program, but below are the samples created. The original keyboard part was a bit sharp, so I took the Intro and dropped the pitch to be in tune to the piano for the first sample. The sample with the 32nd notes was created by cutting off the last half of each 16th note (C, D, F, G) and cut-n-pasting the first half again. I don't know the song yet but I play through a few notes on the MP3 so you get an idea of what you have. For the program, the bottom split would have ""WhoBabaORileyFGW"" with the intro pattern on the F key and a pattern on the G key for when the song changes to a C chord. The middle split would have the desired piano (I used pianos an octave apart to play with one hand so other was free for adding 32nd notes in places). The top split would have the second sample ""WhoBabaORiley32W"" with the 32nd notes.

I really appreciate him sharing them. I've had the Nord Stage 3 for 1 week now and these were the 1st samples I downloaded and they worked perfect.Now for the $64,000.00 question. The band I am in down tunes a 1/2 step on everything to make it easier on the vocals. When I down tune this patch it slows down the arpeggiation and ruins the tempo of the song.  Is there an easy way to fix this on the board or do I need to find other samples? Can I take these samples and modify them to get the results I need? So new to this board that I am not sure what it is capable of.Hello, and welcome to the Forum!  I have a version tuned down a step that I'll dig up and post - perhaps as a larger file to allow playing in either key. In my original sample, I only used the intro on F; absent another sample on E, your Nord is interpolating the F and slowing it down to make it an E (everything time-related is slowed down as well). I'll get back soon, take care.Update: I posted a new NSMP sample covering the original key and a semitone down with my Stage 3 post atnord-stage-3-programs-ns3p-ns3pb-files- ... ml#p151304Take care",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=150941&sid=a0017ea4d5f83e8635fa957d41ae1bb7#p150941

Add Leslie and full distortion/overdrive. Use the Tremelo effect with the Amount to maximum, speed to taste obviously. I then added a lot of treble and quite a bit of middle to get the sound to ""cut through"" a lot more. If you've got a sweepable mid (I think you do on the Stage 2), set the middle frequency to approximate the distinctive middle of a guitar, probably around 800hz to 1Khz.Basically you need to play around with the chord shapes and EQ section to get the right ""flavor"" to the sound - just think like a rhythm guitarist in terms of chord shapes, so try using chords with no thirds, just root and fifth, or root fifth and octave for example. [Edit: I ended up adding the 5th 6th and 9th drawbars pulled out about halfway to increase the brightness. If you use too much of the drawbars to increase the brightness, it starts sounding a little too ""organy"".]You're basically just cycling through the chords - Fm Ab Eb Bb. I played octaves in the left hand as it needed some quite low notes to get the right amount of ""growl"" and depth to the sound.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=68831&sid=d8b71ed0f06e04bc6fe433e3119d5092#p68831

Whereas of course ns2pb file handling isn't. 1) ns2pb files aren't as widely spread as ZIP files, and your computer won't know that this is a special sort of ZIP file; 2) ns2pb files aren't meant to be opened as a container for different parts. They can be, but they aren't really meant to be opened by anybody.So, it will never work with simple clicking - you will always have to know the trick. And the trick is to rename the ending of the file name: change *.ns2pb into *.zip to be able to extract things. And remember having renamed it - as you will always have to re-rename it in order to use it as a Nord sound bundle with the Sound Manager software.The ns2pb isn't the only file format that's a zip container which can be opened while renaming it. The epub format (for ebooks) is the same thing. The LibreOffice file format, too. There are some examples. But you will alway need to use that trick. And if you extract something out of that ZIP file, always use the copy feature, not move parts out: Those special formats always consist of a certain number of specifically named files.

However, just using the  unzip command from Terminal does not collect the extracted files into a specific directory so you are losing the structure and it's difficult to identify everything which belongs to the bundle. You better use the following command in Terminal which creates a new directory (called CakeExtracted in this example) on your desktop and extracts the whole content of the bundle directly into this directory:unzip /Users/maryellenleonard/Desktop/Cake.zip -d /Users/maryellenleonard/Desktop/CakeExtractedHope it helps a bit ... best regardsSchorsch",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=145542&sid=d8b71ed0f06e04bc6fe433e3119d5092#p145542

I don't have a Wave but would suggest starting with the following parameters for the AMP and FILTER: Attack 0, Decay 10, Sustain 10, Release 0 (might be the default for an initialized program).

Good luck!Thanks WannitBBBad.It works. The best way seems to operate with 2 detuned OSC per each lot, and you can play a perfect 5th with one finger. It's perfect at the beginning of the song. I had to reduce the volume of the detunet OSC going on because Tony doesn't play with one finger but he always plays in a 5th way and sometimes in a 4th way, so the single note can't really operate with a strong 5th, but a light 5th is ok and makes the sound very similar.

I never noticed Tony playing the 4ths you mentioned as we play the song as part of a medley and don't do that part - thank you for noting that. I plan to revisit my program to make that change. I also plan to try the right synth sample from keego19 with the information Schorsch provided just to see what it sounds like. It's too much sample memory to use up with the synth already capable of coming close to the sound, but I'm interested now to see how it sounds playing the 5ths and 4ths manually.

For both synths the LFOs are set with the square wave and synced to the clock, the control pedal covers the Wah effect, and EQ is used to pull out some of the midrange. Try it out with your keyboard set up across the range of the control pedal and adjust the midrange EQ as needed to make sure there isn't a frequency range coming through too strong compared to the rest.

I did this a few times and used either the highest or lowest key of the keyboard for it (the keys which are used much less than all others).The flip side is that you have to “waste” one of the synth slots for this, but you can also combine the intro sound on a specific key with another or couple of another sounds for the other keyboard areas when using different wave files combined into one sample with sample editor.

In these days It wasn't easy to carry around a piece of furniture!By the way, I really find no reason to try to simulate the simulation of a real organ, since I have an instrument that can mimic the real thing better than those early synthsesizers. I bet that if they had a nord back then, they would use a pure B3 sound! However, if I wanted to gve that 80's color to the sound, I would layer an organ with an 80's polysynth sample, an OB6 or polymoog. I would also add some LFO to modulate the sample in order to give this tremolo effect (they probably did the same to simulate the lesslie effect).",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=136244&sid=7375301163807c0d15eee93fa63c301a#p136244

It´s a very important step.3 - Use the button ""Bundle Down"" to put the sounds on you NS2. You can use ""add to a bank"" option (NS2 should have some progam locations free) or ""Replace the content in bank"" option (replace your programs).PS.: Sample Partition and Piano Partition has to have some free memory to put this package on your keyboard.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=44412&sid=7375301163807c0d15eee93fa63c301a#p44412

Sorry that I'm brand new to Nord. How can I load this into my Stage 3? Need to convert it?In Nord Sound Manager you may need to remove a few samples you don't use to make room for the two samples (""nsmp"" files) listed at the beginning of this post, then you'll need to make a program to use each.  A few tips for Sound Manager:- View your current samples in organize mode to show open memory locations.- Sort samples from largest to smallest and delete the ones you don't need starting with the largest so you're freeing up the most space without losing as many samples.- Save all new samples to memory locations 250 and above so you always know what you added versus what came stock with the Stage 3.I hope this helps - take care.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=132968&sid=7375301163807c0d15eee93fa63c301a#p132968

So I would guess, with one of the Moog Samples from, the Nord library for the Solo Lead you chould be able to get this typical Muse Solo sound (Be sure to try all of them out plus some additional filtering etc.!!!). Pretty sure you get the Muse sound from there!!For the rest, the VA of the NS2 using Sawtooth waveform should give you a way to replicate the rest of it.

When I connect the instrument to the Nord Sound Manager (V6.86), those samples are shown in red, with the error message 'Broken - Invalid checksum'. The number under 'Version' is then very high and unrealistic, and of course incorrect. The other samples look fine. In the Sample Manager I am then asked to delete those samples, and then restart the keyboard. If I do so, I get the error message that another load of samples is then corrupted, and this is an endless loop, at the end of which I am left with no samples at all.Please note that I am running the latest operating system on my Stage 2, and that I am using the latest version of the Sound Manager.I have tried under 'File' in the Sound Manager the 'Format' several times, and after re-downloading all samples from Clavia's site, and re-downloading them to the instrument, the same thing happens.

(So looking at material other than Kraftwerk!!)Thinking I need another keyboard with good arpeggiator and looping capability, (which might include drum as bonus only),  while I play synth on the Nord, with maybe presets for the 80s synth and piano sounds.  Needing something to work with the Nord maybe layering on top of what Nord primarily is playing, Nord always being the main keyboard with secondary keyboard backing up what I can't play at the same time on Nord with its 2 slots per programme.My local music store PMT in Bristol, UK,  showed me the ROLAND VR09 before lockdown on a casual visit, and it was about £700 then, its now available for about £570.  Awesome price when I consider the price of a Nord.  This Roland VR09 is 61 keys, not weighted,  which is fine as I have my beloved Nord with 88 fully weighted keys for my main stuff.  Looking at videos the Roland VR09 seems to cover a variety of  decades, not particularly 1980s.What do you 1980s guys and girls  think.  Agree, disagree, can you offer alternatives up to approx  £1000 UK sterling pounds.   (I am a classical trained pianist now mostly playing In a David Bowie tribute band which is currently exploring a side line of 1980s music.  Things like modules and tech stuff are therefore a bit alien to me, not necessarily beyond me,  but thinking that is something I might need to get into reluctantly.  Any comments and recommendation welcome).Happy lockdown creativity, and love to you all.   Looking forward to hearing from you.

For the Hammond, the program uses the MW to control the Leslie all the way from stopped to its fast rotation (like a Leslie 22R).  The MW is also morph-assigned to the Effect 1 Rate/Tempo for the tremolo to accent the Leslie rotating effect.  The mp3 starts out with me nudging the MW slightly on-off, ""rotating"" the Leslie to different stopped positions, then moving the MW to slightly-on for the slow Leslie/tremolo, and then all the way up for the fast Leslie/tremolo.  While in fast mode, I turn the tremolo effect on and off so you can hear the effect of just the Leslie and the Leslie/tremolo combination - it's off when the organ sounds louder, but also not as ""pulsing"" as with the tremolo. With the tremolo on again, I then back the MW off to slow down the rotation.The Leslie will follow whatever function last controlled it. If you move the MW, the Leslie will follow that; if you hit the Leslie slow or fast button, the Leslie will follow that including pedal-controlled slow/fast - which leads to the next effect.  On the mp3 I speed up the Leslie/tremolo again with the MW, and then with the MW in the fast mode, I hit the Slow/Fast button on the Leslie to slow it down while the tremolo stays in the fast mode based on the MW setting. The result (to me) is an accented Hammond chorus with slow Leslie that I really like.  I then play a couple bars using that setting with the bass in the lower split.  Turning on the Rhodes and synth at the end, I have the DX7 Rhodes with the Hammond (if you're interested in the DX7 Rhodes sample, more information is provided in my prior post athttp://www.norduserforum.com/nord-stage ... t7676.html<-link).Below are two versions of HammondWheelDX, the second uses an amp with the Hammond - hope you like them.

Actually I don't think morphs, once assigned to the wheel, AT or CtrlPedal are ""meant"" to be operated from the button/knob that originally controlled them, hence I'm hesitant to call what you describe a ""bug"".By the way what you describe actually happens also within the same Program. Try this:Assign the rotor to the wheel. Now increase the rotor speed with the wheel, still within the ""green LED"" range but fairly ""fast-ish"". Hit stop mode to completely stop the rotor. It does stop indeed. Now hit it again to resume: surely enough it starts spinning again, but you'll note it's NOT at the same speed you left it with the wheel; rather, it's at its ""default"" low speed. You touch the wheel again, the rotor will quickly catch up to whatever speed matches the actual position of the wheel.Another example: try now increase the speed with the wheel but go to full speed. Now try press the button slow/fast: it won't do anything. Viceversa, had you pressed it with the wheel still on the green LED zone, it would have switched to fast.These kind of quirks in my opinions aren't bug strictly speaking, but a natural consequence of having two physical controls conflicting over the same parameters. By the way an example of what I described can be seen at the end of this video:Note how they try to act on rotor speed both from the wheel and from the button.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=131614&sid=7375301163807c0d15eee93fa63c301a#p131614

Done for the original key of G. The middle part of the split contains the piano used in the intro and the later choruses. Only two notes are played, D and G in a fast repetition. The lower part of the patch is the organ tone for the first part of the verses.  The mod wheel brings in more drawbars for the second half of the verse and the choruses (I have to reach over with my right hand), add fast leslie sim to taste.  The upper part contains the synth patch for the bridge, which is repeated three times, you can just hit the octave switch for the last time and you are good to go.I am not sure how the splits will translate to an 88 Key unit, though.

Chorus, Phaser and Flanger, the problem here is that in order to do this, the Stage cannot run multiple effects in the same chain per panel on effect 2 unit.  so, the only way around this is to layer 2 CP80 or the Electric Grand which sounds better than the CP80 sample. Panel A would use chorus at 50% mix but I'd slow it down just a touch, Panel B using Phaser at 75% mix and play with the speed. I'd add a touch of EQ on this and also just a touch of stage reverb to sweeten it a touch. you could with both panels enabled put a touch of piano detune  which might give just that bit of edge.  the original principle would have relied on a CP80 with the Roland Chorus unit connected as well as parallel phaser anda touch of flanger..This is where the stage's effect handling could be improved.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=122979&sid=9f262aa0b090c7100e620e1a936592ac#p122979

No chorus, percussion 3d, soft, fast. Start playing with the leslie slow and just before the singing starts, switch to fast.For the piano sound: Use an electric grand with a slow phaser effect.

The rest of the band is on the drummer’s click which is the same BPM. The keyboard sync on NS3 takes care of any minor timing differences with the rest of the band provided the BPM is the same.***Edit:  Just took a quick look at the NS2 manual, an it looks like it doesn't have a keyboard sync feature for the master clock, so on NS2 you would be stuck with a fixed LFO frequency.One of my big frustrations with the Nord Stage is that you can’t (easily) send a click out to the drummer so that timed effects, arps etc. work well.

For a Rhodes, I use EP1 the most, followed by EP7 and EP5. EP1-EP8 are all Rhodes pianos and very authentic, each with their own tonal characteristics based on vintage, amplification (or not), and ""voicing"" of the tines. On a Rhodes, the tine for each key can be adjusted in relationship to its pickup to get the tone desired. Regarding effects, it depends on what you're going after: the phase shifter was popular in the early-to-mid 70s and the chorus took off quickly after it was introduced in the mid 70s. The Flanger was popular with the Clavinet. The tremolo effect was popular with the Wurlitzer, and some artists tried the Rhodes and Wurlitzers through the Leslie. The best thing you can do for sound is play your Nord through a good full-range PA speaker.

Thats the reason for searching for sound-program-settings on the Nordstage itself, using the EQ- and effect-section, to get a mostly original Rhodes, Wurlitzer an Clavinet sound out of my PA. Perhaps I also have to change settings on the mixer also (Allen&Heath QU 16). But it ist difficult to change mixers EQ, beacause the keyboard-stereo-channel of the mixer includes the whole Nordstage, so organ, e-pianos, grandpianos an synthies. Changing the mixer EQ for e-pianos can sound good, but is not good for synthie or organ or grandpiano for example. So I would like to do as little as possible changes on the mixer EQ. Or should I seperate pianos and organ/synth to different channels? The same problem exists with the B3 sounds, to get it as close as much to a origin Hammond B3.

Say for example that my posted program uses a guitar sample stored in my Stage 2 sample memory location 175; if you downloaded them and saved the sample to your sample memory location 199, you would need to modify the synth in the downloaded program to point to memory location 199 (not 175) to play the sampled sound. I hope this helps - take care.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=112307&sid=bdaf15fa0a1e48f0970a259f0d739cd1#p112307

With tranpose you'll only ""shift"" samples on the keys to the left or right.Transpose is not working as a ""pitch"". So if your sample is assigned with different sounds in the original tonality, you can't transpose the tonality of all sounds with transpose.You have to pitch the sounds in the sample-editor and re-create a new sample.Greetz",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=110416&sid=bdaf15fa0a1e48f0970a259f0d739cd1#p110416

I tried all types of Synth settings for SteelGit_DVv4 this morning and fairly confident that the sample is not the problem, more likely it's the 12String and the Harpsichord used.  The control pedal morph affects the 12-string volume in ""LedZep AcGuitarW"".  Without a control pedal, the Slot A Synth LEVEL with 12String should be all the way down with only the 6-string in Slot B sounding in the upper split; if that's not the case with the way your control pedal is assigned, I'd suggest resaving the program to open only using the Slot B SteelGit.In both Hotel Calif programs, I use ""Ital Harpsich 1A Short Str 5.0.npno"" in the Piano section as Harpsi 1 - that would be the first thing to check.  On the mp3, my right hand is playing notes in the middle split and a few reaching into the first octave of the upper split. The top 2 1/2 octaves on the keyboard aren't used but do sound like a Harpsichord if played. You can also adjust the Piano section LEVEL to taper off the Harpsichord volume to your taste.  The B3 heard in the mp3 is likely not sounding based upon the control pedal setting.Hope this helps.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=49546&sid=c99a98954702f9df3195700fef8ebb67#p49546

In the ""LedZep AcGuitarW"" program I used the EQ to take a little brightness off the 6-string as well.

Then you would upload your home Bank D sounds into your laptop, take it to the church unit and download those Programs into that instrument's Bank D.I have three different NS2 / NS2EX variations and this is how I make it happen, though I also dip into other Banks as I have a few hundred Programs I've made over the years.Also, I use the ""SortMode"" a lot - any special sounds I've made I save a ""User"" Category and then I can go into Category Sort to find all of those sounds alphabetically. I did a reunion gig with an older band and had to create a few dozen Programs for that which I wanted to keep separate from my other Programs. For those I saved them as ""No Cat"" and then they would be nicely sorted in their own space using Category Sort.I hope this helps.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=100363&sid=c99a98954702f9df3195700fef8ebb67#p100363

That is a good idea however all of my S2 Bank D is full of programs saved by individual song names that I rearrange for each gig setlist. I guess I could dump these songs to something like Set List Maker to clear Bank D and use the internal Bank D for only program names, but I was trying to avoid relying on a computer to behave at my gigs.I have already manually cross-referenced some of the factory locations for Banks A-C on each machine (NS2 & NS2 EX). Some of the program names changed slightly between the 2 machines but are close enough to use as equals.

I have never relied upon a computer at gigs. I've become more and more efficient with the way in which I use the Banks in my NS2 units along with the Sound Manager. I went through and identified any of the presets I wanted to keep but deleted the majority of them, opening up more than one Bank. This way I can use multiple Banks for different purposes and I have ""snapshots"" of my Programs that I save periodically in case I lose track of a particular Program. I'd say I do some degree of computer hookup/management on a monthly basis.It may take you a bit longer from scratch to optimize the programs you're using, but one tip is to use the Category feature so you could take all the Programs you use for various gigs and tag them as User or No Cat or whatever and then you can sort and filter them very easily, move them around and streamline into Banks. I'll try to take some screenshots of my Sound Manager connected to my NS2 to give you an idea of what I'm talking about. There is also another thread on the forum I'll find that goes into even greater depth about tips and tricks to best organizing on the NS2.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=100444&sid=c99a98954702f9df3195700fef8ebb67#p100444

Compounding my setup problems is that the NS2 EX is a shared keyboard for the church so any customizing is frowned upon.It appears that much of the program name customizing could be avoided if Nord would make the NS3 'song mode' available for the NS2's. Additionally, if Nord offered a plug-in device (thumb drive, SS drive, etc.), that works across all models, to carry individual setup patches/songs, I would buy one. I know it's a lot to ask but I see it similar to plugging in USB devices to a computer where the device drivers load then the device operates properly. That way, I could walk up to any Nord machine and plug in my 'porta-patch' device and be up and running with my specific patches/songs from any Nord keyboard. There may be some limitations on older Nord models, but this would allow individual users to load their specific sound banks on any Nord keyboard...just thinking??",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=100487&sid=c99a98954702f9df3195700fef8ebb67#p100487

I'm pretty sure that the OK Chorale 1 or 2 are the right samples. Those sorts of typical D50 sounds are a nightmare to try and copy with subtractive synthesis - even with a variety of digital waveforms as raw material, you just never capture them.As far as using these samples in ""Simply The Best"" is concerned, it's been a long time, but I remember more or less how it goes. You need to lower the VCA envelope sustain level a bit as the note volume should fade slightly while you're holding the notes, and then simply adjust release and maybe attack time to suit the track.The stabs on the intro and under the verse vocals are simply either lowish F octaves or F5 chord (F-C-F) - can't remember which. The answer riff between the lead vocal lines is 4 two-note chords: playing F at the bottom, the top notes of the chords are just C-D-E-F. So you've got C over F, D over F, E over F, F octave over F -  ie with F as the bass note, the high notes are just 5th, 6th, major 7th, octave. I think I doubled the chords in both hands an octave apart to thicken the sound.

Both Tron and Hammond were put into a Leslie.Here's my solution: I made a split with organ on left hand, and Tron mix on the right.Slot A: Organ (for the 2nd part of the intro) / Brass MkIISlot B: Organ (pedal-like sound) / 3violins MkIIMorph (wheel) between Organ-pedal and Organ 2nd part.All the Synth (Tron) are put into Rotary Speaker, in ""stop"" position, with a bit of Drive.Having used the Rotary for the Synths, I was forced to put the organ into a Twin simulation, with a bit a Drive.Comments, edits and improvements are very welcome.

Usually I bring two keyboards, a Nord Electro 4HP and a Nord Lead 2, and on Moves like jagger I usually play that lead hook on the Lead and a synth pad on the Electro. But last night I only brought the Electro, and as you know it's not multi timbral and I had no suitable lead sound sample available. So what to do when this song came up? Unrehearsed! About five seconds before counting in, I decided to use a Rhodes sound instead (EPiano1 I think), and played both the lead hook and the chords on that. And it worked like a charm! The song became more funky, and people danced like never before!! Amazing!So why am I telling you this? We'll I believe that limitations forces us to be creative. So instead of trying to sound like someone else, I decided to sound like myself, and as a result I played a whole lot better, and the audience enjoyed it even more.

The youtube version you have posted *includes no clav*.  It's not a bad one man rendition, but is completely unresponsive to the thread at hand.  You might as well have posted the SRV version.For the record, I don't have any great suggestions about matching the sound of the original track.  I basically tend to stay on the ""A"" model clav with Brilliance and Treble EQ mods enabled for just about everything for which I use clav.  I use auto wah 1 (or, lately,  an external filter pedal) and phaser to fatten up the sound a little and add some more variety to my overall output.  I do agree that this should probably be a factory pre-set available in the programs, because it is such an iconic sound and part.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=86801&sid=3343f7ddee28e48a445087e5d63aabf2#p86801

The Slots seem to be the half solution here,and indeed it is the best I can have so I take it. However I am confused about one thing.

When I do just basic thing as searching throu the programms, I noticed that some of them are somehow assigned for SLOT A and some of them are assigned for SLOT B... by design: the slot switches automatically when I switch the programm.I have already leart from the manual that you can copy any setting from one Slot to another, but I am not sure this is what would help here...ALSO... I was considering to use another option> spliting the keyboard into 3 parts -> as simple as cake,but, I noticed that I most likely cannot have two different porgrams from ONE SECTION (ORGAN SECTION, PIANO SECTION, SYNTH SECTION) at the same time on the split keyboard. I cannot have e.g. this:LO - PIANOUP - MELOTRONEHIGH - E PIANOOr can I but am I just not clever enough yet??This would solve my problem, since I could most likely also adjust the octave settings (move the octaves within one split)...Gosh, a lot of questions for you, but you are the saviour here...THanks",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=83705&sid=3343f7ddee28e48a445087e5d63aabf2#p83705

I know that someone once nailed this program for the original Stage, but there's nothing here for the NS2 series.This is my first ever attempt to program anything specific on my NS2EX. I can't get over how easy this keyboard is to program, and how much you can do with just one oscillator.I know I didn't come as close as the other program, but I'm hoping this is a good starting point for tweaking to your liking.Slot A is the sequence with the heavy delay. Slot B is the lead. Unfortunately because of the pitch bend limit you can't recreate the pitch jump of the original song. You can cheat a little by playing the high C and then using the pitch bend on the lower notes. I couldn't show it in my demo video because I'm not set up to do overhead shots and play with two hands like some of you othersIf you find it helpful, please let me know!

The arrangement uses lots of very short parts with a lot of different sounds and unique samples, some of them virtually impossible to reproduce. There is no overall single keyboard part or sound for the whole song. It is made more complicated because the guitar also has a lot of important separate parts and unusual sounds, which might be difficult for a single guitarist to cover on stage, meaning you might need to think about playing some of the guitar parts yourself, depending on what your guitar player decides to do.

Try dialing in a fair amount of overdrive. I think the amount of overdrive can be left fairly high - even from the beginning of the line.However, I think the panning might have been done after recording the sound. If you want to achieve a similar effect live I would recommend using the ""A-PAN""-effect and assigning the ""AMOUNT"" knob to either the mod wheel or aftertouch.I hope this will get you a little closer to the actual sound.And looking forward to see if someone else has any suggestions.- Frederik",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=75405&sid=e9473d5903db2c501ed8201e039d5238#p75405

Fully-articulated pipe organ is going to be difficult, but not impossible, to accomplish on this since you'll need to utilize the sample functionality and probably delve into the world of making samples.

Then hold the shift key and tap ""Sound Init"" in the synth section.  Then, tap the oscillator selection button until the arrow is lit next to SAMP.  Then, use the knob in the oscillator section to find the sample you want to play.  That's it.  Then, you can save the program by tapping the red save button twice (assuming memory protection is turned off), or if you don't want to overwrite the spot you're in, hit shift-save, potentially change the name, then save again to choose a place to put it (and therefore overwrite the program you choose) and hit save again.  Alternately you can use one of the live spots to save it dynamically, no save buttons needed.This is all a bit from memory, so hopefully it doesn't vary much, if at all, from reality.  So to clarify what the Stage 2 does, it is really built to model the Hammond B-3 (and other transistor organs, but they're not what you're after) rather than a pipe organ.  The Hammond, of course, was originally built to emulate a pipe organ, but anyone who has played a pipe organ will know that's not really what they accomplished.  The Hammond has its own sound that is a cornerstone of jazz, rock and blues, and to a certain extent worship, but realistically the Hammond in a worship context is there to sound like the Hammonds of yesterday sounded where they were used to take the place of pipe organs.  I can't speak to Hammond in this context because I have virtually no experience with it, but if you search youtube for videos of people playing Hammond in a gospel context it may become a bit more clear what I'm talking about.The only board I know of that takes a stab at proper pipe organ is the C1/C2/C2D, which have a pipe organ model, but I'm not sure even how much closer this will get you to what you're looking for.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=16929&sid=163b6f5b9b6d663376a051e0822e0f8a#p16929

I have the Electro 5D which has a dedicated pipe organ setting for the drawbars, but comparing it to a real pipe organ is like comparing Tang to orange juice.  It's like a gross parody that only bears a faint stereotyped resemblance to the real thing.The samples available also don't sound very good to my ears, and anyway being samples they aren't very flexible.I was however very surprised to discover how strikingly realistic the modeled pipe organ is on the Hammond SK-1.  I would not have thought it was possible to model so realistically (because I've never heard it done so accurately anywhere else), but that thing is fully modeled, meaning you can mix and match via the drawbars just like pulling stops on a real organ.  And the sound... I do a double-take every time!Nord does such a great job with so many other sounds, for example Nord's harpsichords are clearly better than their Hammond counterparts, and Nord's EPs (Rhodes, Wurli) are unsurpassed to my ears.  But the pipe organ just plain stinks on my Electro 5D, which I assume is similar to the Stage (I have not tried anything in the C2 line, so can't comment there).

NS2 vs Jupiter80 :NS21 program has 2 synth sectioneach synth section has 1 oscillator, unison modes (multi is nice) and knobs on the panel.Jupiter 801 Program (is called a LiveSet) can have 4 sounds (including percussion, called ""Tones""), a synth tone has 3 oscillators (called partials).Effects have to be considered as well.The ""fight""is more balanced than specs may suggest 'coz of Nord's ability to summurize things.Jupiter 80 can selection PCM (samples) waveforms for each oscillator.NS2, we can use samples (form Nord Sample Library), an layer organ / piano (with effects and ""uncommon"" settings).You're right, this sound is sweet.Also Cory Henry is a great board player imho.Cheers,F.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=67850&sid=163b6f5b9b6d663376a051e0822e0f8a#p67850

We're a covers band and very few songs use the same preset so D bank is now full and I'm happily chewing into C bank. If I had to whizz through that little lot to find the next song my band mates would rapidly get very annoyed. One tap and I'm good to go. Better still, I've rigged up an Airturn footswitch which connects to SLM via Bluetooth (bit temperamental sometimes and often needs talking to sweetly or firmly, depending on stress levels, to get it to work) and that allows for very rapid and secure programme changes, even within a song. The Nord buttons aren't that big and tend to shrink in the heat of gig battle, so a large chunky footswitch is a far safer option.A breeze to copy the setlist to the next show and edit as required, very customisable, and syncs effortlessly between devices. Wouldn't recommend syncing with other band members, however, as that customisation is different from player to player and I managed to wipe all the singer's lyrics once, which made me very popular.In short: couldn't live without SLM and can't recommend it highly enough.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=66421&sid=b379037f8be008a76d3bf45797ae486f#p66421

While for organ and piano based sounds, it seems pretty straightforward to creadte your nes programs for the NS2, it might be more difficult for Synth patches.One way of converting it is getting all the values in particular of the Synth section and than reprogramming it from scratch on the NS2. To get all values, you can use  the Nord Stage CTRLR Editor software to see it on your computer (downloads.php?cat=7). Start the software, load the patch you want to recreate on your NS Classic/EX, and do a dump (explained in this post:http://www.norduserforum.com/nord-stage ... html#p8381) Then you can set the NS2 to those values and should get very close to the original sound.To share or take notes of patch (in particular, Synth) settings, you can also use this patch sheet:  nord-stage-2-programs-ns2p-ns2pb-files-f15/reo-ridin-the-storm-out-t2389.html#p13499",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=65219&sid=b379037f8be008a76d3bf45797ae486f#p65219

I am not savvy at downloading other sounds into the NS2 (I know, I need to and will learn), but I was hoping one of the many experts on this site could give me some detailed settings for the synth section that could come close.Thank you in advance for any help.Go Hokies!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=13491&sid=182544f1499dd3ab4551a74a1b3e6927#p13491

I made a MP3 sample which begins with the (high) 4 foot sample, changes to the factory organ sample an then plays both together. I can imagine better sounding samples - both are not masterpieces especially for longer hold notes. For that I need some more training with the sample editor.

(maybe it was originally done on a BassStation?)* The Synth that comes in at the break (around 0:55 - thanks for making me watch the video btwshould be possible with a SAW OSC, HPF and maybe amp drive.* The 'Prodigy*' style sound around 2:37 is probably beyond the NS2... you mention other brands in your profile - do you have a MiniBrute by chance?there's a lot of sounds in this song, so covering them all with a NS2 in a live performance may be a challenge! Maybe better off just using some strings on slot A and create a multi-sample for slot B with some 1-shot samples, triggered in a range of the keyboard you don't need for the main strings... might work.In short, I don't think the NS2 is the best tool for this job! (Before I get flamed - I love the NS2, but it does have its limits!)* I mean 'The Prodigy' as in the band, not the Moog with the same name - a very different sound indeed",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=53153&sid=ae422cc69fd00f88a2e74b5a3d9ce793#p53153

Excellent loop points, very intuitive to play and jam along the great beat loops!I have still the idea to create a large set of drum loops, say, 12 different styles, each assigned to a key of an octave, and then have it at different speeds in 10bpm steps over the full range of the keybed. This way, you would basically obtain a full set of rythm accompagniements like on any workstation, availably easily via one slot in one sample file.Only problem is where to get the beats from - while using a VSTi such as GrooveAgent would be very easy, it would not allow to share it due to license restrictions, and I did not yet find freely available high quality samples to create this sample, but I reckon it could be useful to many, just to have a simple way of playing along some standard beats without external hard- or software.

Restoring a backup file to the instrument will always overwrite the entire contents of the instrument.  If you wish to create a file which does not go ""whole hog"" on you, you will want to use the BUNDLES feature.  Creating a bundle of your Bank D will yield a file which contains all Bank D program along with all piano samples and sample samples needed to perform those programs.  Depending upon the size of the samples/pianos you use for your Bank D programs, and the number/size of pianos/samples resident on the instrument which are NOT used by your Bank D programs, this Bundle operation may or may not save you a significant amount of time when writing it to your computer.Using the Bundle operation will always save you much time when re-writing it back to the instrument because whereas the Restore process overwrites everything, Nord Sound Manager, when loading a bundle, will scan the contents of the piano/sample memory on the NS2 for copies of pianos/samples called for in the bundle, and if it sees that the needed pianos and samples already exist in the instrument's memory, it will skip those writing operations.  This will save a HUGE amount of time in your case.It is always possible to simply upload programs to your computer's hard drive.  These are teeny tiny little files because they do not contain and sample data.  Transfer will be superfast, blink of an eye style.  As a practical matter, how many files are we talking about here?  Most folks, I think, might not routinely use more than 20-30 programs in a performance; not the full hundred of an entire bank.  Use the SOUND UP icon to upload these to computer.Bless,Pablo",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=48651&sid=258294d34eecb832c14cbc9b304b435c#p48651

Myself, I use a real Rhodes for this song in particular.The strings in the intro: I just play them halfway through the intro with a Nord Wave. You can use any of the tremolo strings: I assigned an expression pedal to the volume. Perhaps use a delay pedal, oscillate the sound and slowly increase volume and decrease delay. This is possible on a Stage 2, which I do not own, but you can probably assign Strings volume and effects to an expression pedal as well.I play this song a lot in my band, it's a real classic one!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=25904&sid=d34938d3a36a4b92b211635312a1411c#p25904

Thing is, the only Rhodes MkII sampled in the Nord library is a shallow one. A 'normal' Rhodes MkII sounds different, sounds less shallow (figures, right?).I bought a real MkII few weeks ago and got a Small Stone Phaser effect pedal this christmas. Combined, they sound awesome and are spot on for this song.The synth lead just after the chorus you mean? On my Nord Wave, I use a basic saw tooth (I think..), Mono Mode on mono with glide set to about 20-30%, add the Chorus 1 and I assigned the Morph weel to the frequency, for which I use the vocal type setting, finishing with a vibrato on the after touch.This lead sound is also perfect for any song by Jamiroquai. His keyboardist also uses it in Little L and plays with the frequency a bit. That way your lead synth sounds like it's 'talking' like it's a WAH sound , or something like that. Hard to describe, haha.If you want, I can send you my lead sound as a Nord Wave program, I guess. That should be at the end of this week, you can send me a PM if you'd like.

The new EG is really rich and IMHO responds quite nicely to effects. The sample is in three parts, the first part has the plain sample with just a little EQ and reverb, middle part adds slow Leslie with overdrive, and the last part adds chorus and auto-wah on top of that. The attached patch has those effects configured as they appear in the sample, but inactivated initially. No compression or DAW effects other than some crossfade between takes, the sound is as it comes out of the board.I have the amped EG sample in slot 5 of the grands, so you may have to adjust the patch accordingly if you have it somewhere else.Edgy Electric Grand.mp3EdgyEG.ns2p(547 Bytes) Downloaded 372 times",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=43430&sid=d34938d3a36a4b92b211635312a1411c#p43430

But, although I like that new sample a lot, I've frequently found myself switching back to my ""Universal Rhodes"" program, mostly because it seems to cut through much better. So here it is, finally (with a lot of new optimizations, actually).It is a bit difficult to demo because I wouldn't usually play it as a solo instrument. But since a demo is pretty much a requirement, here you go (sorry about the somewhat sloppy playing and low fidelity):Universal Rhodes Demo.mp3So, what did I do?The most annoying issue in the Suitcase sample is (IMHO) its weakness in the second octave above middle C. In its original form, I've often had the problem that it would totally disappear during a solo. I fixed this (or at least reduced it somewhat) by creating a split at B5/C5 with two different EQ/Drive settings below and above. After a lot of experimentation, I think I've found some settings that make the split point hardly noticeable (unless I've just gotten used to it).There is also another aspect to the different EQ settings: The program contains a rather strong upper-mid boost. By choosing a slightly different center frequency for the boost, the negative effects on the sound can be reduced somewhat.Another problem, which can be worked around easily but frequently caught me by surprise, is that the dynamics somewhere around an octave below middle C are really strong. In particular, notes that are played too lightly turn out to be barely audible. The synth section of slot A is used to make the fundamental of these notes a little stronger. The filter is intended to restrict this effect to the notes that need it.The synth section of slot B is used to add more overtones to the notes below F2, which otherwise tend to get lost in a mix. This is very optional, of course, so if you need on synth section for another purpose, use the one in slot B. This also removes the need for the E2/F2 split point.Hope this is useful to someone.

Very interesting the boosting with the synth. For some reason the Rhodes has been a difficult instrument to please everybody.As you say, most Rhodes samples in the Nord feel somewhat thin in the upper octaves. Maybe they have less layers in that section? I wonder if that could be fixed by adjusting the dynamics of the layers.Whichever is the case, Clavia has listened to comments, so let's hope that newer samples will be offered.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=41651&sid=d34938d3a36a4b92b211635312a1411c#p41651

I'm not 100% happy with Slot B, but frankly it will be VERY difficult to get it exact so after an hour of playing around with it, I decided I was close enough and you can tweak the rest of the way to taste.Part of the difficulty lies in the fact that the digital waveforms available in the NS/NSEX Synth's Osc Section are not necessarily contained in the Wave section of the NS2's Synth Section.  It may be impossible to get exact.

If you send a sound out the outputs 3 and 4 (possible as a stereo signal), they will not have the effects applied.At least that is how I think it works, but I don't have an NS2 anymore nor did I consult the manual, so I might just be wrong",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=36498&sid=10474fa3cee2b3450596fa057b829396#p36498

The arpegiator is the big problem as it needs to follow a specific sequence to sound right. And I noticed that the arpegiator from the NS2 is very dependant on the way you press the keys. I mean, the arpegiator needs to start from the root, EVERY TIME, and EVERY TIME - needs to follow (for example from Eb ) - Eb G Bb Eb G Eb Bb G (this is a Eb chord, in a 4/4 time, as eighteens). So, for every chord change, it needs to follow this sequence. 1 3 5 8 13 8 5 3. I noticed that (maybe because of my pressing the keys) - sometimes the arpegiator starts on the 3rd, or 5th and it is not ok for the song. More than that, I cannot use my both hands to make the sequence as I need to play the synth's pad on the right. And I cannot hold and change fast a 5 note LARGE chord for the arpegiator (and more - press it PERFECTLY so the arpegiator with kick on the right note).If anyone has hints - on what I am missing, what I shoud follow on,  please let me know.Thanx.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=36517&sid=10474fa3cee2b3450596fa057b829396#p36517

The sample editor, to my humble knowledge, can only be use when you want to create a sound for using within the 'synth' section only.As for creating a patch, basically you have, per patch, 2 slots - A and B. within each slot you have 1 organ, 1 piano, and 1 synth. You can mix and match as you like and save it to the location you wish for it to be. So in total, providing you use 2 slots simultaneously, you will get 2 organs (although those 2 organ settings can only be build on the same model, ie. B3, farfisa or vox), 2 sounds from piano section and 2 synth sounds from its section.I hope that should give you the idea to start!Tat P.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=35351&sid=10474fa3cee2b3450596fa057b829396#p35351

It's mostly a matter of tweaking, and a lot of it comes down to personal taste. As a starting point, you could try:the MK V sample -- This might be surprising, but I've found it to work best because of its ""clean"" sound (not sure whether this is the right word to describe it; I'm definitely no expert).the ""Small"" amp simsome treble boost (though this probably depends a lot on the song and arrangement)a high dynamics setting -- I think it's important to be able to lay down chords very softly and play strong accents occasionally. (I can't do that very well on my SW73, but it tends to work much better using a weighted controller keyboard.)a bit of chorus, slow and subtle enough that you don't hear it as an effect of its ownoptionally some tremolo or panningrelatively little reverbYour playing style can also make quite a difference, especially because the different velocity layers and sample transitions are very noticable. Some groups of keys have a slight bell characteristic, even in the MK V sample, but only at certain velocities. It probably makes sense to memorize which keys have a noticeable sound, and maybe to use the sweepable mid EQ to make them stand out some more.But in the end, I think the ""right"" EP sample is just not there (yet, hopefully). Something like JaZzMaN251's MK II sample could work, but only with velocity layers, of course. This experiment I made with that sample might also help if you are prepared to do even more tweaking:http://www.norduserforum.com/nord-user- ... t3993.html",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=33062&sid=10474fa3cee2b3450596fa057b829396#p33062

Pink is at the top of her game and the top of the charts.With modern Top 40. there are a lot going on, so the best place to start is to figure out what is being played by keyboards.  There is a piano in the intro, then the first verse is guitar, bass, and drums. At the end of the first verse there is a synth/string swell and the piano from the beginning comes in over that.Just listen to each verse, chorus, bridge, and isolate the keyboard sounds.  It is likely that one person will not be able to cover all the sounds in a single song, so pick the ones that are the most important, the signature sounds, and program patches to cover those.Have fun--dj",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=33150&sid=3fbc4e4a5116a8bd62e4ebacae597f5e#p33150

There's not enough piano memory. And this program won't solve the problem - on the contrary.I like the YaS4 Bright Grand because it is so bright, yet rather mellow, and with the right reverb, it sound so beautifully wide and aerial...But its bass are not very clear nor defined.I like the bass of the Bosendorf better. It has a kind of macho sharpness which is just what I need - unfortunately its medium and hi-pitched notes are too thin to my taste.NO PROBLEM : let's just split the keyboard, use the Bosendorf for the first two octaves, and the Yamaha for the rest !In XL quality (I wouldn't go for less), that's about 400Mb for just one program, but hey, this is just the best piano sound to my taste ever. (I had to do away with the Italian Grand to make room, not without regrets though. I also had to get rid of all the upright pianos, which is too bad because I like the honky-tonk and saloon ones.Life is the art of compromise, which may be why it so often sucks.Or maybe Clavia should just put more memory in their keyboards.)So, here it is. The Bosendorf should be in grand piano model #1, as from factory, and the Yamaha S4 in grand piano model #2. The split point is in 2nd split position. You can move it to 1st split position: that sounds good too. Any other place would defeat the whole point (and be noticeable), so better keep the split to either one of the first two positions.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=30416&sid=3fbc4e4a5116a8bd62e4ebacae597f5e#p30416

They're not always all enabled at the same time, however. It's up to you to enable/disable effects at will.- All programs use the Mod.

Nord piano sounds straight out of the box sound a bit thin and weird in the EQ to my ears especially after years of Yamaha.  So I set up my CP33 and my NS2, found the sound closest to my Yamaha sound, which is the Bosendorfer and then set about EQ-ing it to sound and behave in roughly the same way.  I am actually very very happy with this sound.  I have the Dynamics set to number 1 and my EQ setting are as follows: Bass +7.9, Mid Freq 263hz Mid boost +3.6, Treble +7.6.

I cannot believe they can't all be achieved just by taking a particular piano and tweaking with a bit of EQ to obtain all the others. Is this not a bit like The Emperor's new clothes?I also wonder if the sound samples on the Clavia website are from the actual original pianos, and not from the Nord instrument. I can never get my Nord to sound the same as their examples - even using the same speakers. Would love to know what 'effects' they have applied, because it always sound much richer and more 'piano-like' when I listen to their examples.As an aside, I recently replaced the Bose with the Faz in Piano Bank 1 on my NS2, but must have done something wrong when 'linking', because I had to go through all my saved programs to link them to the new piano (I was just getting a - sign in the model window whenever I chose a program that had previously used the Bose).

I wonder how much latency this has got.Saludos,Gustavo",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=28925&sid=3fbc4e4a5116a8bd62e4ebacae597f5e#p28925

I was considering Ableton Live due to it being marketed as being THE loop based DAW. But in Reaper you have the loop within selection thing, and I think there is a way in its settings to use it as a loop recorder. But since I have the Kaossilator 2 and KOPRO, I mostly use those when I want to do loop stuff. Maybe I'll try this week to do some loop based music on REAPER, see how that turns out. That piece of software is truly flexible. EDIT: Just found this:http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/mar12/a ... s-0312.htmSomething that may help recording: Options>Preferences>Tracks/Send Defaults set your Record Config to Stereo L+R and select Record Arm. That way each time you add a track (CTRL+T) it is ready to record.Also, this time I used midi just because I never had... I think its an excellent way of ""writing"" stuff. Like this week we are rehearsing Grover Washington's Just the Two of Us. And I believe I am very prone to forgetting how to do the intro. But if I record it in midi, I can hear it when my NS2 is connected and I can see the notes being played.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=28993&sid=3fbc4e4a5116a8bd62e4ebacae597f5e#p28993

They work great but we had to do some trickery as we needed it to be in a different key as we have a male singer! I ended up doubling the part with some other fast attack strings off the NS2 - which worked really well.In terms of the whooshing sound, I'm thinking its a filter thing too.  White noise and opening of the filter.  With the resonance set right it should give the desired effect.  I'm not sure if bandpass is the way to go, although that would produce a nice result too. It might just be a bog standard LPF sweep.  More than likely in the studio they just drew a volume ramp in pro-tools and cut the end off at the desired point rather than messing about on a synth (soft or otherwise).  So the attack idea might work well in tandem with this?If you manage to get it right, I'm gonna stick it in our version too!

Hope it's okay for you.When I listened to the song the synth seemed to go a bit off pitch back and forth. I would personally do that with gently rocking the pitchbender back and forth, just very slightly. That seemed to get the best effect for me. I also put vibrato on the wheel, so you can use that instead if you want, but it didn't seem to be as good IMO.If you are curious how I made it. I just chose the FM synthsection. The first one gives you a sinus wave which makes that kind of sound. I then turned the shape knob on 50% and just added some attack and release. Lastly I added some chorus from the effect section and some reverb.But remember to use the pitbend (or vibrato from the wheel) to get that off pitch sound.I might try and make the sound for the other song for you later, but that is really hidden by all the other instruments playing, so it is a little harder to hear how it sounds exactly.I might also upload an mp3 later so people can hear how the patches sound.Hope this helps.Best regardsCbas",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=5084&sid=e84565e14290e7ac6d2775d3e994f6bc#p5084

I tried also with Masterclock, Sync via USB-MIDI (the problem got worse!) maybe Ill try MIDI-DIN, slowing it to 80bpm, but still. Not really sure what's going on. Based on simple Sawtooth, I like the fatness of the sound. Fun to play around, but the sync issue keeps me for the moment from using it live...must have played it 50 times but once you miss it by a splitsecond it takes time to get backI feel love demo.mp3",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=22860&sid=e84565e14290e7ac6d2775d3e994f6bc#p22860

The limitations of the arpegiator in the Stage 2 make it very difficult to replicate the song exactly which previously led me to conclude that I had to manually play it. I have attached two files, one with the manual version (GLv4) and the other with arpegiator (GLv6). It's getting the double note at the front that is difficult and made more challenging by the fact that the LFO does not reset when you play the song. The option of LFO key sync is certainly something we could do with for this song and for the Stage 2 in general.I used delay and LFO filtering to help create some of the sound and have also added the option to use TREM by moving the mod wheelI've added some audio examples playing manually and with arp.GeoffI Feel Love GLv4 audio.mp3I Feel Love GLv6 audio.mp3I Feel Love GLv4.ns2pStage 2 Program (Manual version)(547 Bytes) Downloaded 609 timesI Feel Love GLv6.ns2pStage 2 Program (arp version)(547 Bytes) Downloaded 689 times",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=23059&sid=e84565e14290e7ac6d2775d3e994f6bc#p23059

So I will try to immitate Wakeman's more ""modern"" playing and add some of my own falvor. So that is why I am asking for the patches. Also I am aware that is MY homework, but it'd be nice to have some starting pointsso not to start blank. Eventually I would end up modifying things to my taste (not necesarily to sound more wakemanish), so I'd share all of my patches with you guys, although I plan on using my MOPHO (or eventually a Tetra) for some leads, specifically I have in mind the hard lead on Close to the Edge (just before the really hard organ solo).Anyone has some useful scores available? A friend of mine has got the Yes Deluxe Edition Score Book, which supposedly has around 6 albums completely scored, but I do not know how precise it is. It would also be nice to be practicing based off on something digital for home use. I will dedicate myself to searching for good midis and pdfs but at the end those will only be the base, as I might just end up playing something different and the solos may be just an aproximation to wakeman's, depending on how the band feels about it.Saludos,Gustavo",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=20815&sid=e84565e14290e7ac6d2775d3e994f6bc#p20815

In some cases, you can use the controllers to Morph between two sounds in the same slot (you might be able to do this with the filter for the brass sounds, for example). In some special cases, I have had to use two programs to get all the splits and layers I needed for a patch, and put them next to each other so I can go back and forth between them with a single button push.  This is usually necessary when you need more than an octave or so to cover a particular part. I would recommend you figure out all the sounds necessary and then go to the samples and patches forums and see if any of those are close to the ones you need so you can just download and install them with a minimum of tweaking. I have created a number of patches which contain multiple different splits and layers for different tunes, so you could also check them out to use as examples for your own setups.

In my band when our guitarist uses a full, saturated tone I tend to dial up my highs, and when he uses a higher lead tone I emphasize the mids more, always seems to work..  The other issue is arrangement, if it's originals you're playing, you'll want to arrange the playing in such a way that the two instruments aren't competing too much for attention..  unless the piano is the driving force I'll drop back and fill the empty space more..

Switch to the other slot and you can play along.I recorded the metronome using a simple audio loop which was not really a good idea so it is very noisy, sorry for that, but was a long time of recording it so wanted to see if it is useful at all before doing a 100% proper version.Cheers!Johannes",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=18337&sid=e84565e14290e7ac6d2775d3e994f6bc#p18337

The display then shows the corresponding parameters  without changing the values.Switch off all the effects (including unison) and listen to just one slot. That gives you an idea of how a patch works.This particular sound consist of two layers: slot A and BSlot A produces the essential attack part that would let you recognize it as strings, slot B thickens the sound to make it also a pad sound.A:String attacks are usually created by an envelope modulating the filter cutoff frequency by a short decay time.Here I’ve added  waveform modulation (shapeable sawtooth) done by the same envelope to increase the violin attack impression.The whole thing is multiplied by the unison function and the chorus-fx.To broaden the stereo image I used the pingpong  delay.B:This part is not necessarily supposed to be good sounding taken by itself. It should rather add components the A-part is missing.So I used permanent waveform modulation by LFO to make sure any interferences between A and B  wouldn’t lead to frequency cancellations.I used a slower attack time,  different filter characteristic, different delay-fx and some EQ.If you compare slot A and B playing just single notes you’ll notice how different the slots actually sound.A bunch of fiddle players all having their own sound …Cheers",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=17802&sid=afc552dcd952a5a037c7cd8f436d22b8#p17802

Really nice lead sound, hope you can help me out.Hello Laver,I agree.That is a very beautiful, and magical lead.I suspect that its' beauty lies more with the player than the program, or instrument.It's a simple sound.To my ears:It's based on a saw type wave (probably virtual analog, rather than sampled), little, to no detuning.Monophonic mode, possible legato also with some glide added to simulate a vintage analog like the Minimoog as Shark suggests.I also hear a quick, shallow trumpet like attack, 24db low pass filtering, no KB tracking.This sound was done with the Wave (not simply because he's shown playing it in the video) but because it has AT controlled, LFO modulation of the VCA (tremolo) rather than vibrato (something the Stage series doesn't do).I believe the tremolo could be simulated on the NS2 by sending the Synth section through Effect 1 (Tremolo) and using AT to control ""Amount"" via the morph feature.The same type of lead sound re-emerges about 2:08 in the video, but using a pulse wave with a little resonance.I'd love to give this one a try, but....

If not, please let me know where I should post this. (Soon to a proud owner of a Nord Stage 2, this week). I have read similar posts in the very same section.I have been trying for a long time to get an exact replication of this awesome, very unique keyboard sound in the song ""Only the Lonely"" -  the Motels:I have come close with Korg, Roland, Yamaha, Alesis, & several VSTs but never could match that unique sound & tonal quality it has. I spent hours & hours trying. Also, I have never heard a single live, cover band that emulated it correctly either.  I too have been in many cover bands over the years but could never nail that sound down. If you listen very closely to the original, it has some percussion, organ, synth, piano, & some other hollow sound that makes so unique.I went as far as contacting Marty Jourard  who was the keyboard player for the Motels in the 80's:http://www.martymethod.com/martybio.shtmlWe emailed back and forth for awhile. He says he used a Prophet 5, but has long lost all his notes for the settings he used (bummer).  So I went and bought a VST of the Prophet 5 and never could even come close.  He may have used a Prophet 5, but I think it was layered with some other synth.My Question:Has anyone ever tried to emulate this unique sound (with success) in a sound patch created from the Nord Stage 2 ?When I get my NS2, this is one of the things I will look forwarding in ""trying"" to program.Thanks,SynthzGuy",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=13037&sid=afc552dcd952a5a037c7cd8f436d22b8#p13037

As a result I felt the need to also upload something. Here are some EP enhancements.The Stage2 EP sounds are nice but I needed some extra attitude. The easiest trick was to introduce some velocity controlled ""attitude"" on top of them. I created six different attitudes (samples) that can be used together with any of the Stage2 EP sounds. The correct settings for the samples are included in the attached program or synth setting files. The samples are a bit lean for most purposes to be used alone.The idea is thus to combine one of the Stage2 EP sounds with one of the attitudes. The program and synth settings refer to sample 999. You should turn the SYNTH - OSC sample selection knob to pick one of the attitude samples. Save your own version of the program (or synth) when you kow where the samples are stored and which one of them is most useful to you. (In the synth settings you may also need to adjust the SYNTH - LEVEL knob since that setting is not inclued in the ns2n file.)Some tuning options:- use SYNTH - LEVEL to reduce the amount of attitude- use SYNTH - FILTER - FREQ MOD 2 - MOD ENV to make the sound less responsive to velocity- use SYNTH - FILTER - FREQ to add attitude also in the low velocity notes- use SYNTH - OCTAVE SHIFT to change the style of the attitude (1 octave lower may be useful)- use SYNTH - MOD ENV - DECAY to limit attitude to the beginning of each note- use split to eliminate the attitude from one end of the keyboard- use MORPH ASSIGN to control the attitude settings (e.g. CTRLPED to SYNTH - LEVEL)JuhoEP Attitude.mp3",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=12050&sid=afc552dcd952a5a037c7cd8f436d22b8#p12050

It's a great forum.  Thanks to you all for the great info and the time you've put in to making this forum so great!I am also waiting with excitement for the new sax/brass samples from Clavia.  I'm confident they'll be great at whatever they attempt, I just hope they consider us performing in R&B bands.  It seems like so many other companies focus on orchestral brass or solo lines that don't really cut it and I've never been able to get them to be useful on stage.  The only instrument that has helped me be successful is my MotifXS. As of now I'm pretty much lugging it around for my brass patches.  By layering several different programs together for different situations (small brass ensembles AND solo instruments, esp. bari-sax) you an get pretty great, expressive natural brass sound out of it for various R&B situations whether it be James Brown stabs (with or without falls), Jungle Boogie-type lead lines, supportive melodic lines, and even 'padding' situations.  Of course, handwork on the pitch bend and mod wheels is important.The thing that concerns me is the Nords inability to transpose more than and octave in either direction.  For splits you need to be able to play a bari-sax way up there on the actual key bed but you've got to be able to transpose it a couple to a few octaves down to keep it in it's natural register.  Most brass ensemble samples/programs I've come across are missing the ever important lower end to give them the power and density they need to work.Does anyone know if there is there a place where I can make suggestions to them directly?  I'm assuming the only workaround is if they include a strong enough lower end in the samples of small, medium, and large brass ensembles because we won't be able to compensate for it on the back end without being able to transpose as much as needed.Does anyone have any ideas or other workarounds?  Man, if they get this right for my purposes I'll be able to go with just my Stage to many, if not most of my gigs...Thanks in advance,GRod",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=6216&sid=600a2cfeae78d07ce434d945c9ff9207#p6216

The portamento, or glide should be very low as to be imperceptible.The mashed up element to the sonic character ""for my version"" was created by ring modulation in the effects section, but in the original, I feel it was the oscillators and filter being slightly modulated by a noise waveform.My gut instinct says the original sound is a Moog Voyager.This sound demo was done with my NSEx.While this is FAR from spot on, it tends to get the point across.I'm confident that another member could take this to the next level.JUST_DANCE_SOUND4.mp3I hope this helps.Cheers, Hanon",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=3514&sid=600a2cfeae78d07ce434d945c9ff9207#p3514
