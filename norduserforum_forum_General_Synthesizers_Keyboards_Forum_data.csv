So yesterday I went to Thomann in order to buy the V-Stage. But I came home with a Stage 4 73.So what happened? The V-Stage is great in theory. The did many things right.Pro:* Modeling Piano with infinite velocity layers and deep edits (piano designer)* hybrid E Pianos with own effect section containing 90 effect programs* Zen Core Synth engine, capable of Juno 106 und JP Sounds* Sample Sounds with velocity layers (guitar glide when hitting key hard)* well designed large Color display* multi channel audio interface* adapter for apple mainstage* Scene chains (song list mode)* less expensiveBut some points disappointed me:* Waterfall key bed very weak, totally non weighted, cheap feeling.* Hammer Action 88 key bed very strong and heavy. Over 20kg.* User interface not as good as Nord. Levels of the two synth layers only after a/b switching. Like before on Stage 3.* Synth sounds mainly presets, only minimal edits (attack, release, cutoff)* only left/right split. No four zones. No cross fading.* No arpeggiator* effect section capable (delay/reverb as send effect for all layers), but not as intuitive as Nord* Layout looks quite ugly in my perception, large black panel without optical structure* Many small features missing from Stage 4 (Solo, xfade, undo, etc)So I fell in Love with the Stage 4. For the following reasons:* I love the 73 hammer action keys. Perfect mix for piano and synth.* 73 Waterfall is also great, much better than 76 waterfall from v-Stage* very, very intuitive operation. Every button is labelled for every feature.* the programmable synth engine is unbeatable. I created some own Juno Sounds immediately.* and finally: the optics. On stage it has to be red. That’s the benchmark for stage keyboards.In conclusion: could be competition only for Stage 3. Many new features from Stage 4 are missing.Any comments and other opinion?",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=182316&sid=4a7e7fc468f36f564601cb6d8086b774#p182316

But who knows when it’s coming out and what it will actually include.Nord keyboards have been a core staple of my live music playing since returning to music in 2009. Most of the time was spent playing on a history of Electros, but I switched to the Stage 2EX 76 in 2017 as my main board for quite a few years. It was time to move on, sell the Stage while it still had value and graduate to something beyond the HP action to improve my experience.I bought the Piano 5 73 last year, but I really missed the organ engine of the Electro. I’m also still not over the 10 pound weight gain over the Stage 2EX HP I had been carrying before. The Yamaha YC73 is sort of in the midway point between the two, and that weight savings is a real positive and very evident to me.I find more practicality	in the Electro over the Stage for my own use. I need piano and organ, but do not need the synth engine or duality the Stage offers. I would also prefer to not spend that much money on something I won’t use. The YC is more of an Electro competitor than is it a Stage alternative in my eyes. The pricing is more in line with the Electro, although the YC is still less money.For what it’s worth, I sold my Stage 2EX to a good home and the proceeds of that, along with some gig cash I had set aside paid for 95% of the YC.Anyway, I thought I would share my impressions of this instrument from the perspective of a person who has been playing exclusively Nord keyboards for the past 15 years or so. Bear in mind that this review is only in the context of the music i play (big band and small jazz combos), the way I use the instrument (live gig/rehearsal through a single powered PA speaker) and as an alternative to the Nord Electro/Piano.I'll post in multiple sections to keep the overall review readable.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=174413&sid=4a7e7fc468f36f564601cb6d8086b774#p174413

Most of the reviews I read about the 73 action weren’t complimentary to true piano use, and that was more favorable for EP playing. Compared to the Nord HP/TP-100, it’s soother, tighter and quicker feeling. The TP-40 on the P5 is certainly more buttery and expressive, albeit heavier to carry. The YC action plays very well live; responsive and quick. Acoustic piano plays just fine on it, at least for my level of skill.The touch settings are much more flexible compared to the Nord, and I’m able to get a touch response that seems to suit me. The touch response is also stored with the program, so it can be customized for each type of AP/EP. That said, however, I think Nord’s finger-to-ear connection works very well out of the box for my playing and really doesn’t require the depth of adjustment I’ve had to make for the Yamaha.The action does not have a high trigger point for the organ, which is no secret to anyone who has read a review about this instrument. This will not be an issue for my context. The action is light enough to do some decent organ playing on, which is a big plus over Nord’s HP action. Also I can always take my Electro 6 out for truer organ playing should the need arise.Next - Yamaha's User Interface and Experience.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=174414&sid=4a7e7fc468f36f564601cb6d8086b774#p174414

Yamaha doesn’t think the way Clavia does, and I’m very much used to the Nord instrument workflow. Despite Yamaha’s boasting of an immediate UI, there is still a dose of the cryptic “Yamaha-ness” in the navigation and more menu diving than I care for. It’s an overall deeper instrument compared to the Electro or Piano 5, but some things are over complicated or just not logical. My nose is in the manual a lot.When you call up a patch that uses the expression pedal, the volume defaults to the loudest value, like the pedal is pushed all the way down, and not based on the pedal’s current position or the softest position. If you don’t know this going into a program you can be in for a shock when playing the first note without first moving the control pedal to orient it.Settings are not always where I expect them to be. Again this is due to me being used to the Nord workflow and not necessarily speaking Yamaha just yet. There are some powerful features (like copy/paste at the page, program or layer level), but it’s a bit of a diving process to get to them. Yamaha has included some key shortcuts, some of which are obvious, others you have to look in the manual for, which is a bit self-defeating.Next: Sounds",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=174415&sid=4a7e7fc468f36f564601cb6d8086b774#p174415

I don’t like the way the Brake/Fast/Slow buttons work though. I tend to play the old school 1-speed rotor approach for traditional jazz, using only brake and fast. This is easily done on the Electro with just the Brake button, which is more intuitive to me. On the YC, you need to press Stop to brake the rotor and Fast/Slow to start the rotation. You also cannot program a footswitch for brake on/off either, which I don’t like.Huzzah, it features the proper Drawbar 9 cancel on percussion.I have not yet dug deep into the organ side of the YC, so I can’t comment on the other organ features. Maybe over time I’ll get to it.PianosIn the solitude of my studio, the piano sounds are not as rich as the Nord library, at least at first listen. In a live band context there was no significant difference. The Damper Resonance effect (discussed below) helps give the piano sounds a bit more depth.So far, the Hamberg Steinway and S700 samples stand out live. The S700 is a real gem for me. It blends well but can stand out when needed. It reflects a nice singing quality that smaller grands have, and the bass is light enough that it stays out of the way. Serves more as an alternative to Nord’s Amber Upright rather than a grand piano in its own right. I’ve also been working with the Live CF3 sample, and there is some potential for that voice in my repertoire. I tend to prefer the woodier sound of a Steinway compared to Yamaha’s acoustics, so the Hamberg is my go-to.Not yet connecting with the other pianos. I tried the Nashville Grand, but it just does not fit my ear for big band. The U1 is rather horrid to me as well. I’m not a fan of the actual U1 piano, and the sample contains all the stringy annoyances of the real thing while sounding out of tune.The Nord Piano Library is vastly superior, specially the uprights which they give proper respect to. That said, I’m happy with the Hamburg and S700 pianos, and am warming up to the Live CF3.Still working with the EP sounds. I’m not much of a Wurly player, so the ones that are included are adequate for how seldom I use them. Still trying to get my head around the Rhodes samples. Some of this is just sheer familiarity, as I’m comfortable with Nord’s naming convention and know what to expect from their samples. On my Nords, the Stockholm and EP2 (1975 Suitcase Mk1) are my go-to’s and meet all my needs. I’m not yet comfortable enough with the YC’s selection and still feeing my way around. Overall, though, I think the Nord EP samples have more body, warmth and expression compared to Yamaha. I tend to play EPs with minimal to no effects and the Nord samples stand up very well to that. On the YC, I feel like the samples always need effects of some sort. More to come.This may sound ironic, but I actually prefer Nord’s digital EP sounds over the DX/FM pianos implemented in the YC. Again, I’m not much of a user of these sounds, but the Nord digital EP’s (specially the Roland samples) just have more body and sustain; the YC’s are all just too delicate and tinkly. Odd, since Yamaha was the originator of this character of digital piano.For each of the Keys engines there are separate Tone and Filter/Envelope adjustments. The Tone is a single variable control, giving it a different flexibility compared to Nord’s Piano Equalizer buttons.The EG/Filter control is an interesting beast. I’m not sure (yet) if they both are active simultaneously and you just use the button/knob to switch between them for control, or if you can have only one at a time. Regardless, the lowpass filter implementation is interesting, as you can apply 7 different filter curves to your sound. The curves vary how the cutoff and resonance interact, giving you some flexibility to enhance or attenuate certain frequencies in your sound. It’s handier for a piano patch than it seems.The EG has 11 different types, again varying how the attack, decay and release interact. I’ve not yet messed with this setting. The Eg is obviously more useful for synth than piano.OthersThe synth/sample sounds run the gamut from usable to meh, heavily favoring FM synth sounds. Aside from a few basses and jazz vibes, I’m not sure how much I’ll use this part of the instrument.Just like with the Piano 5, I’m starting to enjoy dual piano engines. I’m not a piano-and-strings player, but I do like to double up AP and EP on occasion. I hope the next Electro has this capability.Next: Effects",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=174416&sid=4a7e7fc468f36f564601cb6d8086b774#p174416

For each Keys (A/B) engine, you have two separate and independent insert effects. That means you can run combos not available on the Electro, such as ring mod and tremolo or chorus and vibe. It also means you can have a different phaser on each Keys type with independent settings, again not available on the Electro.In addition to two insert effects per Key engine, there is a third Effect that can be applied to any one of the Keys A, Keys B or organ engines. The list of available effects is largely the same as the insert effects, excluding the digital delay and damper resonance, but including a tempo delay and a looper effect. The looper is applied to all the YC’s sound engines. I’m not a looper user, but I guess this has value for those who do.The variety of effects available is larger and more varied compared to the Nord, but I wouldn’t say they are better. For example the YC has four phaser effects compared to Nord’s 2, but they both have Small Stone emulations which is really the only one I care about. YC has four chorus effects compared to Nord’s 2, similar wah effects, bigger delay variety, a reverse reverb, Lo-Fi, slicer, additional lowpass filter and harmonic enhancer. These are of limited value to my use case.This is followed by a Speaker/Amp section which includes a variety of emulations, drive and tone controls. This can be applied to any single sound engine. Since the compressor is a separate insert effect, it is not part of the Speaker/Amp selection list like it is on the Nord keyboards.The insert effects also has a selection of amp sims apart from the Speaker/Amp section of the instrument. The Speaker/Amp section does not include a “small” speaker (assume to be akin to the Wurly speakers on the Nord), but it is a choice in the effects list for the particular Keys A/B section. Again, a bit of Yamaha’s “left-field” thinking.Each effects slot uses a dual 7-segment LED display to tell you what effect is in that slot, so you get indicators like “Co”, “PE” or “r2” - nice and informative, eh?. This is a typical Yamaha UI approach which I find cryptic and annoying. Also, the dials for the effects are labeled “Depth” and “Rate”, which applies well for some effects but is completely misleading for others. On the EQ for example, the “Rate” knob controls the upper band while the “Depth” knob attenuates the lower band. The guessing game is annoying, but fortunately the OLED display tells you what is changing when you turn a knob or hit a switch.One of the effects is Damper Resonance, which seems to be a combination of damper and sympathetic resonance as well as Nord’s Soft Release feature. It creates a nice ambience but can sound like you’re playing from outer space if turned up too high. It also uses up an effects slot, which then leaves you only with two more - one for the section and other general effect that can only apply to one engine. This is less of an issue for acoustic piano, since compression and reverb are probably all I’d use on those, but creates a problem for EPs, which could be more effect heavy, so some choices will have to be made.The compressor is the secret weapon in this instrument. It does a good job and is really helpful for gain management. The Depth knob controls the amount of compression and the Rate knob manages the overall volume. You can push the levels pretty hard well while still having the instrument fairly natural sounding.There is a master EQ, but it’s global and not programmable like on the Nord. That’s a shame.For someone like me who uses only one or maybe two sounds in a single program, there is enough flexibility for me to work with on the YC, just as I’ve never found limitations with Nord’s approach.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=174417&sid=4a7e7fc468f36f564601cb6d8086b774#p174417

It does not have a full synth engine on it, but rather a collection of samples/waveforms that you can tweak a bit. It betters the Electro’s synth capabilities in three ways:- the samples can respond to velocity more deeply- Monophonic ability for leads and basses- Pitch bend / mod leverEven though Nord does not have velocity layered samples, you do have some capability with the Electro for the sample to respond to dynamics for volume and filter. And while the envelope control on the Electro is still simple, you at least get two parameters to control it instead of a single knob on the YC.The Nord has the advantage in that the synth samples library is much larger. With the YC, your selection of core sounds are limited and you get what you get. And I’ve got a strong suspicion that we will not see another OS update for this instrument and the waveforms/samples are not user expandable.That said, I’m not sure when/if I’ll ever use these features since I play mostly piano and organ. I don’t even use strings or pads in my normal repertoire. Because I don’t really use the Electro for leads, I’m not all that vocal about including pitch or mod levers on future models.The Yamaha EcosystemI tried searching for a NUF-like community for this instrument and so far have come up dry. Yamaha does host their yamahasynth.com site, which is mostly their endorsers posting up some stuff. The user forum section is currently “under construction”, severely restricting the amount of actual user interaction and sharing. Not sure if or when it’s coming back.All other searches for user forums on this instrument mostly yield communities focused on their arranger instruments and not the stage-oriented stuff.Also, it seems Yamaha has moved on from their focus on CP/YC instruments. Granted, both of these series are now a few years old, but Yamaha is on to the next thing they want to push, and right now that is the CK series and the new Montage ESP feature. A friend of mine went to NAMM this past January and said the YC was nowhere in the Yamaha suite. He was told inventory was limited, which is a lame excuse as far as I’m concerned. The product’s manufacturer certainly has access to their own inventory; they chose not to show the product on the floor. A pretty clear message to me that they are done promoting this product and that we won’t see any more OS updates. It would at least be nice to see the yamahasynth user forum back on line.I have not tried Soundmondo. Frankly I don’t see the reason as this instrument is fairly easy to program once you understand the features and UI.

This is different from Nord’s implementation.Comes with an FC3A sustain pedal, which supports half-pedaling but is not recognized by the Electro or the Piano. The YC is rather finicky with a simple on/off pedal, as it seems to get “stuck” every so often, mostly while programming. This could be problematic, I don’t want to swap pedals in and out of my gig bag depending on the instrument I’m playing. I’ll continue to fiddle with this and see if it behaves with my regular M-Audio pedal at the gig. So far it has not occurred during regular playing.All the factory piano programs come with the expression pedal enabled as a default. What’s up with that?The instrument’s shape is a small challenge. All four sides taper in at the bottom, which causes you to be a bit more cautious while placing and lifting it from bag to stand. I prefer the squared off sides of the Nord Instruments.The OS has some odd little bugs, mostly while programming. Sounds will cut out and features will momentarily disappear  while you’re tweaking. You sometimes have to back out of what you’re doing because you think you did something wrong.I know this is not the popular opinion, but I like Nord’s fixed split points. The lights help my feeble little head understand where the split points are, and the fade feature is a wonderful thing. The YC allows you to split anywhere, but there is no split fade and you have to remember where your split point is.LikesThe six pound weight difference from the Piano 5 is very evident to me. This is an advantage for the schlep.The action is light and relatively fast now that I seem to have found a touch sensitivity that works for me.The organ engine is pretty good. Between the H and F settings, you have a nice variety of flavors. And there is a mono mode for the rotary amp if you run through a single speaker.I’m starting to like having the two simultaneous piano engines. I’ve got a couple of AP/EP combos that I like, and the YC does this well. Granted, the Piano 5 can do this too but not the current Electro, and we don’t know if this feature will carry over to the next Electro model.There is more than enough variety and flexibility in the effects from my use. They sound pretty good as well.ConclusionsFor the moment, I no longer feel the pressure to have a decent feeling action, lighter weight and good piano/organ capabilities. I’m still interested in the next Electro, but my itch has been scratched for now by the YC; it is now my regular live instrument.I like the sounds, feel and quality of the Piano 5, but don’t like the weight and miss the organ of the Electro. The Electro 6D doesn’t have the piano feel I need for 90% of my playing, so it’s not suitable for my everyday live rig. And I won’t buy another HP model until they upgrade the TP100 action. Not sure what I’m going to do with the Piano 5 right now, but I will hang onto it for the time being. I’ll probably use it for intimate piano gigs where I don’t have to haul it long distances or up the stairs.So despite its oddities, the YC is now my gig rig. Not perfect (and not a Nord), but it’s luggable, playable, fairly workable and sounds pretty good after the learning curve and twiddling.That's all for now.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=174419&sid=4a7e7fc468f36f564601cb6d8086b774#p174419

I decided to sell the Nord Electro, because the action just isn't adapted to the way you play an acoustic piano.I would have loved to stick with Nord, but they just don't offer what I need.If you are looking for a piano with an organ engine and correct key action, the only option is the Stage. The problem is that it comes with a synth engine that I don't need, and it makes the instrument very expensive.And there is no alternative between hammer action and waterfall, which means that, as a piano player, you need to buy the Stage with the weighted keys, which, even in the 73 key version, is very heavy. The YC73 is 3,5 kilos lighter than the NS 73.It's true that the YC73 needs some getting used to.But the action is a great compromise between heavy weighted keys and a waterfall keybed. It allows to put in the nuance needed when you play acoustic piano.The organ and the electric pianos sound nice; I prefer the piano sounds of the Nord, but the S700 sounds very well in a live setting.Another major asset of the YC73 is its price. It is a lot cheaper than Nords!So if Nord puts out a nord piano with an organ engine and a semi-weighted keybed, I would be happy to consider that option. But for now, it's the YC73",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=174808&sid=4a7e7fc468f36f564601cb6d8086b774#p174808

It's the APs where the expression is difficult.That said, there is really no universal action that is equally great for both piano and organ. It's pretty much one or the other. If you want optimal actions, you need a 2-board rig. I don't have the energy for that, so I'll compromise.I'm 95% piano, so playing organ on the YC73 piano action isn't going to kill me. The YC73, although more of a piano action than organ, is still not terrible for organ. It does lack a high trigger point however, so you can't really do that cool percussive stuff on the Electro. It's always a trade off.Who knows whether the YC series is near end of life. The CP line came out well before the YC and they're still being sold. Besides, I would not judge the usability by how ""old"" something is. Gambold, I know you refer to a lot of the Nord samples as old, but if they're usable, the age is irrelevant. I still use the ""old"" EP2 sample a lot in my music.

The Clavinet was also a one and done for them, and even their FM sample set, once a source of fairly regular and interesting variations, has fizzled out.

I have now a cover for each keyboard that I own.But lately, as I need to look for a job, I couldn’t deal with music, band, shows, while being stressed by my job research, so, I put the band in stand by.I should use the cover but I like to play for me a little bit now and then and removing all the covers is a bit of a burden and it’s way nicer the way it is displayed without the cover. If I have some bad days with bad mood, I go downstairs visiting and having a look at all the Instruments and they heel quite well my mental situation; like gear could be a good medication.So, I was wondering if there is a portable dust vacuum that is available on the market like the one you see on television for dust in your car on the seats.

So I bought one. Here’s are my thoughts and the reason that I returned it.I play gigs, lots of them. Uk and Europe. I have used Nords since 2007.I’ve had most of them. I currently have a Stage 2 76 and an Electro 6D 73. And lots of other keyboards. I’ve had 3 x Stage 3’s and don’t like them.I’ve been playing since the early seventies. Including some name bands.So im gigging lately with my E6 and fancy spending some money. So I see a few decent youtube videos of the YC61 73 88 etcIts being sold as a great live keyboard, with Ac piano’s, EP’s, Organs and some synths etc. It has pitch bend and mod lever.Lots of Live Sets. And as it looks like Nord have abandonded the live set modes. I was interested in try one. I like a 73 so that’s what I got.The keybed is really nice. They describe it as an similar to an EP keybed. I think its great and it was even nice for organ palm slides. I did upgrade to the latest OS with the better rotary. Its very good.The Piano feels and sounds lovely.I programmed up all of the sounds I would need to gig. I tweaked some nice sounds.I wasn’t sure if it was actually cutting it, The live set mode was a bit rubbish. Its difficult to see, The screen is small, its not an Oled display. I think that in the heat of battle the display would be pretty useless. Theres so much in it that you can hardly read itIn live set edit mode there isn’t even a move command. It has a swap, but that’s not really as useful to me.If I need to re arrange the set during sound check, just before a gig, My E6 has an organize mode which is great.So I sat with both of my Nords plus the YCA-B ing them with both of my Nords I found that the keybed of the YC73 felt similar to my stage 2 76, which has the nice fully weighted keys. And the lovely CFX piano in the YC sounded great, it actually sounded very close to the White grand of the Nords. The Rhodes didn’t sound even close, The Wurlitzer was rubbish. The organs were v good but I just don’t think they were right for me. It didn’t really have a Vox conti which is important for me. The other sounds, Strings Synth etc were all very nice, But I felt there was something missing, Something that I have in my Nords. It was things like not being able to use the sustain pedal to also control the rotary. I find it handy to just use one pedal. And the master reverb didn’t have anything you could adjust accept level, and anything above 1 was way to much. You cant even select which type of reverb, stage room etc.The YC73 does have a couple of things that I would like on a Nord. The XLR out’s plus a pair of jack outs. And the Jack in’s would be very handy.So I put it back in the box and sent it back. Nice, but for me, not a gig board.Norm",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=165531&sid=4a7e7fc468f36f564601cb6d8086b774#p165531

Also, for your reverb comment, you can easily adjust the insert effects to be any of the reverbs you want, as well as adjust their rate and amount. I find the Stage 3, and now Stage 4 compact editions a perfect partner to the YC88, which has a built in audio/midi interface, and allows me to play the awesome Nord pianos, with a far superior action on the Yamaha. If I had to get by with just an iPad and the YC88, I can set up B3X on the iPad along with PianoTeq and Tal-a-Uno LX and have all the sounds I could need, in a great easy to use and interface included package with the YC.

But I'd agree that is still not ideal for re-arranging  the order during sound check, where you're likely to want it to move it to a location that you don't want to overwrite (hence the swap function). You're probably looking for some kind of ""insert"" function that would move all the subsequent Live Sets as well. Re-ordering at-the-gig from within the board is probably not so practical. At home, the John Melas librarian is another option. At the gig, if you need that function, I'd probably look at something like Set List Maker on a smartphone, where you could create a master song list and orderable (and easily reorderable) subsets for any particular gig. Tapping on a song name can easily send the Program Change to the keyboard that would call up the needed Live Set regardless of its location. This can be an equally useful strategy on Nords.Normskiwrote:↑16 May 2023, 17:13It was things like not being able to use the sustain pedal to also control the rotary.

With that it comes with something like a Pitch- and Mod-Wheel (Yeah!). So I decided to take it as upper Keyboard for Organs and Synths for my Live Set with the NS4.But with the days I got very disappointed by the ""other"" Sounds. Okay – there are a handful of the famoust,  really great and useful Motif-Sounds in, but (for a ""Live-Keyboard"") not many what makes me happy on my search for some alternative backing or Solo-Sounds (but tons of FM- and especially lots of SynthBass-Sounds?!?). With that these Sounds are a little thin and cannot cut through the Live-Mix (but you set them really loud). With that I found patches that have nothing to do in a 2000€ Keyboard - f.e. the guitars are a joke and something like an OBX-Jump, cannot be created without sounding techno-alike, since the raw-samples are that way. The greatest feature - the Effect-Section - looses its advantage when you had to programm something with a 2-digit Type-Info and easy to confuse controlers (you should try to add or change some effect on a poor light on stage - you cannot find / hit the desired button / controler). In Sum the whole interface did not reach me - and I really had some experience with Stage-Keys...It still is a great product with a great Organ-Sound, a few good Yamaha-typical Sound, a great FX-Section, an ""interesting"" new type of keybed and built as a tank to last. But I decided that it will leave my inventory and I´ll take a NE5 or NE6 (61keys) instead. Currently using my old NE573compact and being much happier than with the YC61.Well - since two73er Keys are looking a little oversized, I surely will change to a NE6D61 soon...Just to add - I´d also had the CK61, but the Organ (and the rotary-sim) was to flat for my requirements. It had more and even better ""other"" Sounds as the YC61, but still an old MX49 offers more and better ones. With that the output gain was very weak for any reason.

To be honest, I only use the sound engine from the NS4, so the NE6 is just used as a MIDI keyboard for organ and synth playing. Unfortunately, it is not possible to do a setting so that the NE6's high trigger point is used for MIDI note on. Now comes my questions: Is there a reasonable 61-key MIDI keyboard with a waterfall keybed that uses a high trigger point for sending out MIDI on so that it is perfectly suitable for organ playing (and maybe also for synth)?I'd like to point out, that I do not want to use the NE6 as a sound engine because then I would need to switch 2 keyboards when going from song A to song B. Also, program change programming is something I don't like. I'm aware that this would be possible.I'm looking forward to your proposals.Many ThanksEumel",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=176893&sid=4a7e7fc468f36f564601cb6d8086b774#p176893

That may seem like a pain, but you'd get a lot more flexibility in the long run.Astrolab is honestly a joke unless you only play presets and don't want to design your own sounds. In order to design a sound you need to buy VCollection. Also, while I  understand the control set has to be smaller than the software, they could have incorporated a similar system to how their KeyLab controllers work. You get way more knobs and sliders on those to control their own software! The concept is  great in theory, I love the idea of taking software with me and not needing a laptop, but I'll wait for the next variation of this device...preferably with a better panel layout as well...The Yamaha devices only use samples for their synth sounds (except the new Montage M, and the FMX engines.) So they aren't going to do analog-style sounds as well. Certainly fine for a gig though.If you can find one used then the Sequential Prophet X is awesome. I have that paired with the Wave 2. But you really need to be into sound design to get the best from that one.Hydrasynth is cool especially with the performance controllers but in order to get the best from it, again, you will need to be a good sound designer.

The reason is exactly as you said, except that I already know for a fact that the voltage in my mains is very variable to say the least. Depending on which home appliance is powered, voltage can go from 180 to 240... the UPS keeps a steady 239 V all the time.You probably already know this, but it has to be a double conversion UPS for this to work the way you intend, because offline UPSes and line interactive types only protect against power outages. The problem is that double conversion types are the most expensive. I paid mine € 350 (and it's very small, 1000 VA), but that was before covid before the war before the world went crazy.

Probably this isn't the right term? What I am referring to is the fact that the lower the notes, the harder the keys are to press (and possibly the longer it takes for them to come up level).In acoustic pianos, is this feature a byproduct of the fact that the hammers have to strike bigger strings, or is it something intended in the construction of the instrument so that lower notes oppose more resistance when played, so to speak? Some sort of ergonomic ""feedback""?I asked a friend who's a tuner, and he said he thought it to be a byproduct of piano manufacturing, but he wasn't totally sure.I am pretty sure I have read here on NUF that some Nords have graded action, but I couldn't find anything on the website (admittedly, I didn't go through all the manuals). I would expect only the high end pianos to have it, like the Grand and the Piano 5.Anyway, maybe there's some (acoustic) pianist on here that has a knowledge of this.Thanks",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=166372&sid=4a7e7fc468f36f564601cb6d8086b774#p166372

Graded WeightingEvery single key on a grand piano keyboard is weighted differently. This is because the strings for each note are slightly thinner and shorter in the treble register, becoming thicker and longer towards the bass register. As a result, there is greater resistance when playing low notes than when playing high notes. In other words, a heavier touch is required in the left hand and a lighter touch in the right hand. To emulate this in a digital piano, the keys are often individually weighted, with the lower keys heavier than the higher ones — something that’s called graded weighting.which is the actual explanation of why on acoustic pianos the lower keys must be heavier (you need more hammer energy to hit thicker strings and generate the same volume than you need for thinner ones).With regards to which Nord model may us GH; I guess like you probably only NG and latest NPs may have that (but Nord does not indicate that explicitly in teh specs)",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=166373&sid=4a7e7fc468f36f564601cb6d8086b774#p166373

But I wonder whether that was the case from the beginning of the history of the piano. I guess it's a bit of a chicken or egg first kind of thing.Anyway, it's strange that this feature isn't much advertised by manufacturers (apart from Yamaha, apparently), given that (I'd assume) it would be a seller point for people interested in accurate piano action.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=166378&sid=4a7e7fc468f36f564601cb6d8086b774#p166378

Initially, I developed the app in Android, MacOS, Python, and Pythonista. Recently, I created a native iPhone and iPad app. Though it took some time for me to become familiar with Xcode, I discovered that an app will only work for a week unless it is released in the store. Consequently, I decided to enhance its stability and universality and release it as my first app.When performing with my band, we typically have a setlist, but sometimes we deviate from it. Therefore, chord-display software invariably necessitates scrolling. This is not desirable in a live setting and consumes too much time. To address this issue, I developed an app that displays all songs on one screen. Upon selecting a song, the app displays it in full screen. By clicking the screen again, the user returns to the overview screen.Furthermore, the app has the added features of sending program changes and playing audio files (for backing tracks or other purposes). It works well and quickly in my band environment. Since it is based on iCloud data, I can modify everything from my desktop. I use it to create backing tracks with left-click and right audio. Additionally, I control my Nord Stage 3 and Nord Wave 2. The program changes are generic, but I have created an easy program change mode for those devices.

I'm not trying to retire my NS2 but I feel the need to try something else.Music centres near me don't have many keys to look at (just electric pianos and couple nord instruments).Some things that I'd like to have in my next gig companion (not necessarily, I lived without some of them 'til now):I'm used to what my NS2 offers so I'd still want a nice hammond emulation (my main sound)velocity layered sounds (I had a funny Korg X50 whose infinite menus allowed this).Speaking of infinite menus, I don't mind a little more menu digging.Again, that X50 had a really customizable arpeggiator. (but s****y soundsimo. Anyway, it broke)I rarely felt limited by the 2 piano 2 organ 2 synth of the NS3, but sometimes it would have been nice to layer more sounds.I love the semi-waterfall keyboard feeling, so it would be a nice thing to have.Vaguely keeping in mind what I'm looking for (they arenotstrict requirements), which are your favourite keyboards from other manufacturers?Thank you!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=160497&sid=4a7e7fc468f36f564601cb6d8086b774#p160497

I love my electro 5D for being an easy to carry fine organ and piano, and I still play and love a korg X50 I guess since 2006 or 07, it‘s still working. Maybe because I have a standby second power supply with me, the original one doesn‘t break. Fingers crossed.If I were you I‘d consider a two board setup with an electro 6D 73 and a korg kross 2.And, because you are talking about the korg‘s sounds: I love the brass and string sounds, I like many of the synth pads, and even the pianos and e-pianos are at least good enough for rehearsals or less important gigs.

But I think in the case of the Hammond is even a bit more ""extreme"", so to speak. Marshall amps were not designed to be overdriven, but they were designed as amplifiers/speakers by people who knew what they were doing. Laurens Hammond on the other hand was not a musician, and the very idea of emulating different pipe ranks by mixing doses of different harmonics could and can be considered dubious in acoustic terms.

Our music man mostly chose a pipe organ sound to fit the 'event'. Sometimes, it was a piano sound, sometimes a pop solo entertainer auto-accompany synth sound (including strings juice and the like). There were no complaints. Unfortunately, the instrument is broken now, so we only have YT videos for music accompaniment. A lot of elderly are thankful for everything. Yesterday, I happened to hear a conversation saying: Hopefully, we'll get something to eat - no matter what.Sounds a bit bizarre, but what I want to say: Music and being there for them matters more than the sound style - if they're familiar with it or not. Of course, older people may enjoy things they know from their youth. But then: Most of them were young when rockabilly got into the world. They are persons who grew up in the 20th century - even if it was the first half, it wasn't 19th century. There's only the problem that music styles quickly diverted and some will be used to country or folk music, some to classical, pop, rock etc. music. It will not be classsical music for the majority, though. So I'd say: Just let it groove and swing! You will certainly find a way to pick up their consumer habits and please their moods. And get into relation with them. What counts most: Don't take them for idiots but reasonable persons - if they still can express that or not. And last thing but not least: Enjoy and have fun!Long answer short: I'd pick EP sounds, maybe from the 50/60ies up to the 80ies if I had to choose - together with AP for some music.

My only aim is a good keybed feeling, I don‘t need master functions like multi MIDI things etc. Some months ago I liked the korg, today I didn‘t.korg in details:The keys move a bit too heavy, they don‘t feel like a weighted piano mechanics but just „braked“.Their way from top to bottom is shorter than I‘m used to.The surface of the keys is too slippery, it feels like the plastic of my korg X50.The sounds are mid quality, I wouldn‘t use neither of them.Roland in details:The keys move too heavy as at the korg, same feel.Also here shorter way from top to bottom than I expected.The surface of the keys surprised me, far better grip than the korg. The material is structured like my old piano teacher‘s instrument.Among the sounds there are some which I would use: I love Roland‘s Jazz Scat, and the concert piano and the B3 surprised me.Studiologic SL88 studio in details:The weighted feel is better than with the two of above, but: If playing hard, the keys always vibrate three times when reaching their bottom, as if they land on elastic rubber. This is nothing for me. Sidenote: I have a good Sauter piano with Renner mechanics at home.Studiologic SL88 grand in details:Good, weighted feel, good movement.Smooth, accurate landing of the keys.nord Grand in details:Good, weighted feel, good movement. I‘ve expected it far better than the SL88 grand, but this was not the case. It’s good, but by far still no „real piano“ substitute, I‘m afraid. Once again: I only looked at the keybed feel.The Bechstein - okay, this is out of comparison and no fair competitor - this was very good. This company seems to have done a lot in the past 20 years, even if I compare with the last Steinway I happened to play.If I had to choose a master today, it would be the SL88 grand.Cheers from Germany",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=149602&sid=6bca72d02f572cbf304f0948630da96d#p149602

The ASM Hydrasynth or the novation summit for example, are some very decent ones that could enrich a lot your sonic palette.

Although it's definitely a chameleon synth, it excels as a string machine for luscious sound beds.I can zone it wherever I need swirling and evolving pads, Juno'esque bass enhancement, perky stabs, etc.  I also have a couple of CME X-keys, which makes blazing fast mono leads and glissandos effortless, thanks to the CME's ""chicklet"" style keybed. The DM also works well enough with my Electra One control surface / MIDI hub for anyone who might have that device.The DeepMind's build quality seems excellent. No clicks. No pops. Buttons and sliders are all solid with decent resistance and no discernable play. Noise floor could be a tad lower, but it's not bad at all. Oh, and the infamous cooling fan can be turned down or off if the sound bothers you.The only issue I've had is when utilizing max polyphony in unison mode. Gotta' have good timing when using the sustain pedal during fast chord transitions or things can get wonky, but that's just an issue with limited polyphony and not specific to the DeepMind. As for the DeepMind's MacOS editor app, although not perfect, it works okay.If you think of the DeepMind as extra oscillators, filters and effects as an extension to the Nord synth (arguably, the weakest section of the Stage 3), then it can really enhance your overall sonic palette. Also, since the DeepMind synth has its own very ample effects and 8-slot mod matrix, you can potentially use the Nord's synth without effects, which frees those effects for use with the piano and/or organ sections.For the music I write and for the price, it's a steal IMO. YMMV.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=154060&sid=6bca72d02f572cbf304f0948630da96d#p154060

I can share my experiences?My motivation is wanting access to realistic sounds (horns, strings, woodwinds, etc.) that are tough to get from the Nords.  And it's working pretty well.  I'm also having fun with all the other great-sounding instruments available (Moog Model D, Hammond B3X, etc.).  There are some fascinating instruments out there that you can give a whirl for not much invested.I use AUM as a host for several instruments as well as effects and whatnot.  I am finding it stable for the most part, the underlying AUv3 modules vary widely in stability, recoverability, etc.  I use a small Tascam USB interface w/midi to get sounds in and out of my iPad.  I tried with bluetooth and the latency wasn't working for me.  I also found that sounds generated by the USB interface sounded a bit better than what was coming out of the headphone.Add a powered USB hub and that's my new rigI am focusing on the SWAM iOS instruments (trumpet for now) as they're the first ones that sound realistic enough to my ears that they'd fool people enough.  Woodwinds and strings to follow.  The key to getting the full expressiveness of these instruments is to have a realtime XYZ midi controller driving expression, vibrato and flutter/growl.  Simple aftertouch or mod wheel isn't nearly as good.Last week I found an easy way to turn an iPhone 8+ into a very powerful XYZ midi controller, connected via bluetooth (latency acceptable here).  The software is free, instructions are here:Overall stability?  It's getting better every day.  Turning off all alerts and screen lock was helpful. Learning not to fiddle with AUv3 tools while playing was very helpful.

What tunes should I quickly learn that people in the pub will love. got a gig a few days after rehersal assuming we can figure some stuff out!I can play Buggles-video killed the Radio Star, I can do Madness - it must be love, I can do Monkees - a believer on the organ, its great so see people really dig stuff like that when I do it at pub jam evenings.So suggestions folks.. whats cool well known songs which feature a keyboard prominently?its quite annoying looking on youtube for keyboard parts of songs as people often try to play the whole tune on just keyboard, which is not what I want, I need to fit in with other people and play just the keyboard part that would be in the original track.Just trying to figure out the piano part to Crash Test Dummies - Mmm mmm mmm mmm.I am lucky enough to have a Nord Stage II so i shoudl be able to get the right sound for any purpose.Right, lets here your top suggestions.... thanks!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=23363&sid=6bca72d02f572cbf304f0948630da96d#p23363

171541,6,6bca72d02f572cbf304f0948630da96d,p133269,Impressions with Roland A800 Pro as a controller for organ,deleted,Hlaalu,2020-08-14T09:22:20+00:00,False,,"Hi folks,I thought I'd share my impressions about the Roland A800 Pro used as a MIDI controller for the NS3 Organ.As a NS3 88HA owner I was faced with the problem of finding a non weighted 61-or-so key MIDI controller to be used to play the Stage 3 Organ. Surprisingly, though (or maybe not so surprisingly, given the relative marginality of the Organ as an instrument), it turns out there aren't many -- if ANY -- MIDI keyboards specifically designed to operate an organ. I thought I wasn't wanting too much if I wanted waterfall keys and 9 faders to be used as drawbards. That's it, this would have been enough, but I couldn't find any. So it became a question of the best compromise.I first tried the M-AUDIO Code 61. It has 9 faders and, looking from the pictures, it seemed to have an ""acceptable"" keybed. Turned out not only the keybed was really really UNsuited to organ, but the build construction left much to be desired. Putting it on a X stand was enough to have it warped VERY noticeably. I can only imagine what happens if you try and triggering aftertouch... you literally see the space between white keys increase and decrease as the whole board is flexing... I'm sure it's a great MIDI controller to be used on your desk with a DAW, but for people like me who want to actually phisically *play* over it, it wouldn't last many gigs I'm afraid... Anyway I returned it without even switching in ON (thank you Thomann for your service).I was then looking at the Novation Impulse 61. Seemed pretty solid, but the keybed didn't look convincing, plus the 9 faders it has don't look like something you could easily grab and move as if they were drawbars.Since spending more than € 300 was literally pointless, for my purpose, I eventually went for the Roland A800 Pro, which I've been using for a month or so. While not being totally satisfied with it, I think it works well ""enough"" for me to keep it. The keybed isn't technically waterfall but it's solid and playing organ on it definitely feels good. Palm glissandos are also very much feasible. Build construction is OK, much better than the Code 61. The biggest limitation of it in my opinion is its on-board firmware programmability and its software counterpart. It feels like something old even for the 2010 when it was released. Not very convenient menu digging and even the manual is uselessly long and not always straightforward. I already found a couple of bug as well. I still managed to get what I wanted out of it, but this is only because what I wanted was easy to obtain: drawbars and a few buttons and knobs to adjust some organ parameters. Stop. I imagine though that for more refined set ups one would have a harder time.Considering there aren't really hundreds of solutions, I think I'll be OK with the A800. It's still a pity because I'd love to see MIDI controllers specifically designed for organ anyway.So, to wrap up: the MIDI controllers market seems to be structured in such a way that, at least in this moment, it's much easier to find a 88 key weighted keyboard and pair it with a keyboard like the NS3 Compact, than it is to find an organ-oriented MIDI controller and pair it with a 88 key weighted keyboard like the NS3 88. I think this is what I'd be telling to my former self, when I decided to get the 88.Hope this helps anybody asking himself the same questions...",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=133269&sid=6bca72d02f572cbf304f0948630da96d#p133269

The S1 has higher quality piano sounds compared to the S300, but it's not worth it for me to upgrade. USB connections are easy, it's super light, the action is fine and it sound pretty good.

I’m trying to figure out a decent balance between portability and capability. While the 25-key controllers will fit into a backpack or carry-on, they are completely inadequate for any kind of playing, recording or figuring stuff out (I’m not into making “phat beats”). The products that are playable are generally too long and not suitable for carry-on baggage. They can be checked for the large international flights, but won’t work very well for puddle jumpers.As a result, I’ve been figuring out how to continue music during our extensive travel times. It’s apparent that traditional piano practice is out of the picture. I’ve been making a list of jazz solos I want to transcribe, and am starting to look into using the iPad as a more robust DAW platform to maybe do some mixing or in-the-box arranging and recording.Piano de Voyage just came out with a new lightweight modular keyboard.

Back then I had Windows 7/8.1, and a Nord Stage Classic 88. I now have a different PC (Windows 10) and a Nord Electro 6D. I would like to use the Roland XV5050 s/w and it's Editor again.I have installed the XV5050 Editor and have also hooked-up the XV5050 by coming out of a USB port (on the PC) with a cable which splits into MIDI IN and MIDI OUT dins. Not sure what you call these cables (USB to MIDI I guess?!). Anyway, this works fine and the PC and XV5050communicateas they should do.However (I'm not sure if this is possible?), I would like to be able to PLAY the XV5050 from my Nord Electro 6D. Specifically, I think I would need to configure a MIDI THRU routing (as the Nord only has IN and OUT). So, I have an (M-Audio) MIDI-SPORT (2x2) which has: IN A, OUT A, IN B, and OUT B (MIDI din ports). In addition to this it has a USB port, and the option to switch the device into MIDI THRU mode. I was thinking maybe the MIDISPORT (2x2) could come in between the MIDI OUT of the Nord and the MIDI IN of the XV5050 - but unfortunately this is not so. The XV5050 has a USB port on the front panel, but having a cable connected to the PC makes zero difference.I also just d/l the most recent drivers for the MIDISPORT.It was advised, a few years ago, that I either use Cubase, or purchase a patch-bay, in order to achieve my objective; however, I'm wondering if the MIDI spec on the Electro 6 is moreadvancedthan on my previous Stage Classic model?Many thanks in advance for any kind assistance offered here . . .Best,Paul David Seaman",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=149672&sid=6bca72d02f572cbf304f0948630da96d#p149672

However, I can only play it monophonically (ie. one note at a time). And this is the main reason as to why I would really like to trigger the XV5050 from my Nord Electro 6. To perform any programming, or auditioning of presets etc, I am not able to do so to a sufficient level via the PC's mouse/tracker-pad.I don't think it is possible toplaythe XV5050 module via a USB cable?Personally, I would have thought that the USB port on the front panel of the module is for loading/saving data (and does not transmit/receive MIDI info); and the MIDI IN/OUT dins are for performing MIDI tasks (inc. loading/saving Sys.Ex).Hope the above helps.Much appreciated,PaulEditor XV5050Editor.png (664.04 KiB) Viewed 4353 times",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=149716&sid=6bca72d02f572cbf304f0948630da96d#p149716

I found that when my Electro 3 had an organ patch sound selected (for the sound the Electro itself would produce), then my Electro 3 sent MIDI information to the XV-5050 making it seem that the key had been pressed very hard. You probably would not want this for most of the sounds you would be trying to access on your XV-5050. This is easy enough to solve - just set your Electro to any sound such as an acoustic piano or EP as opposed to an organ.Evening harmonizer,OK, thanks. So you MIDIied your Electro 3 to the XV5050 module and played/triggered it.  That is basically what I intend to do during band practices, and creating my own music with Cubase etc. When I had my Stage Classic 88 back in 2010 that is what I used to do also.But I am looking to be able to utilize the XV5050 s/w Editor in order to manipulate the module for programming, whilst being able to play the XV5050 (from the Electro 6) withoutrestriction, like you ordinarily would on a gig.I'll get back to you regarding tomorrow your other points because it's been a long day and I want to relay all facts to as accurately as I can.Many thanks again,Paul",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=149717&sid=6bca72d02f572cbf304f0948630da96d#p149717

So you will think that you are pressing keys on your Electro to test the new Patch or Performance settings you just created from the XV Editor. But if your XV is still in edit mode, you might change some settings by pressing keys on your Electro. And you won't really know what settings you just changed. My typical reaction at this point is to utter a 4 letter word, and then power off the XV-5050 so that ALL changes I have made will be backed out.To avoid this problem, make sure you leave Edit mode on your XV-5050 (you probably want to save the change) before you press any keys on your Electro to play-test it.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=149718&sid=6bca72d02f572cbf304f0948630da96d#p149718

Because of this, I mostly use the Nord or B3-X for recording and the actual C3 for anything else. There are times when I’ll take the trouble to mic up and record the C3 for the ‘real’ sound but not all that often since I can get the Hammond sound I want a lot easier with the emulations. The main thing the real organ has over the others is the keyboard feel. I find it difficult sometimes to play naturally on anything other than my C3.

Also the tempos and mix, drum sound, settings are stored with each rhythm.I plug the audio into the 'aux in' on the keyboard, and use a stereo jack splitter cable from the headphone out as the main out.

You need to have your computer based BIAB running to get content first. It has to run a piece of server software, and I'm not even sure you can do it on a Mac. Once you download it to the app, it will play without the ""server"", but you cannot make a single change to it. Needless to say, I don't use it.I create mp3 files on BIAB to load into my iPad. A whole lot easier.Session Band has great sounds for practicing, but the control is limited. There are no intros or endings, and it will just repeat until you stop it. But the sounds are great, and you can comp behind the sax ""solo"".

Is it Kick with compressor?

I’m most impressed by the drum samples used which I hear are high quality multi sampled sounds and the attention paid to giving it a more human feel in the rhythms -very realistic. Yes, I opted for the foot switch as well as the midi breakout cable.

To me, the Nord keyboards' latency (time from pressing a key with medium velocity until audio out from the instrument's sockets) is obviously small enough so that it doesn't bother me (NS2EX, NLA1). I remember in the old times, that e.g. the Roland U20 had quite a big latency that hindered me from playing real groovy or perfectly in time. Playing those instruments didn't give me acoustical feedback that was 'direct' enough. This latency topic was not a topic anymore to me in the last 20 years. Now, having bought two synth simulations for my iPad Pro 2015 (iWavestation and the Moog Model D) I'm suffering from that topic again. I am using the original Apple Lightning to USB 3.0 Camera Adapter plus the Thomann MIDI USB 1x1. Did anybody ever measure the latency on any keyboard or synth simulation? Would a newer iPad be faster? How can I overcome that?What are your experiences with professional emulations like e.g. Keyscape running on a MacBook? What MacBook is needed at least for that? Is such a MacBook comparable to an iPad?Many questions, many thanks for your comments in advanceGreetsEumel",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=142646&sid=6bca72d02f572cbf304f0948630da96d#p142646

My first Hammond, that I first played when I was 15, was the C3 in my church. On a real Hammond, the expression pedal does not reduce the volume all the way to no sound. You set the tab to Normal for playing in the normal range with other instruments, choir, church congregation singing etc. A Hammond with a real Leslie is loud, able to compete with drums and brass. But when you want to play organ behind someone speaking (as is done regularly in some churches), the range of control is very limited at the bottom end of the pedal range and also might not go low enough. So to play quietly, you flip the tab to Soft mode, and now you still have a comfortable and controllable dynamic range on the expression pedal.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=141908&sid=6bca72d02f572cbf304f0948630da96d#p141908

You cannot tweak the basic sound of the acoustic pianos, but you can of course apply 3 built-in filters and quite a lot of EQ to make them suit different uses, and you can also adjust a few parameters like sympathetic resonance. For the electric pianos, you have 5 filter-tunings that does a lot to tweak their sound and character, plus of course EQ and whats-not in terms of effects. Between those, I think there are many many options to find something that suits your musical style(s).Before going all-in on the Nord, I used to have a piano where I could tweak a bunch of settings. The underlying samples were somewhat boring, so you would in fact need to tweak some of the parameters a lot. I spend quite some time doing so, especially on the electric ones, but I never found something that was convincing.With the Nord, it's like playing a real instrument -- it comes with a full package and each have their own tonal character. I personally find that I can always find a basic sound I like, and tweak it (with filters and EQ and effects) to suit just about any style I need, and I can do so with 30 seconds of adjustment, not hours of tweaking.YMMV, of course -- but I'd personally rather have a few really good samples than infinite tweakability of somewhat less than stellar material",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=135975&sid=6bca72d02f572cbf304f0948630da96d#p135975

I call all of them ""preset players"" as you're not going to do much sound sculpting in realtime.The Nautilus, in particular, has a number of arranger features which could be fun, plus it does all the great Kronos sounds that Nords struggle with -- horns, woodwinds, etc.   Not a big deal in my gigging bands, although in a studio setting the balance might tip.There are many other differences (tag @anotherscott for a full explanation), but it's hard to imagine that a Stage 3 is a ""wrong"" choice.  Stepping back, Nord set a high bar with the Stage 3, and it's obvious that competitors have taken notice.  The Stage is built around a set of design principles you either agree with, or don't.  If you agree with their design principles, there's nothing better in my opinion.EDIT: btw, I am an acoustic piano sample purist.  From my perspective, the only things better than Nord piano samples played through great amplification are 1) multi-gigabyte virtual instruments (not going there, thanks) and 2) something outrageous like a Yamaha AvantGrand.As mentioned above, Nord gives you a wealth of source pianos which can be shaped and layered to your heart's content",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=135981&sid=6bca72d02f572cbf304f0948630da96d#p135981

Many of them share some features, but every single of them is unique. Most important thing is that every musician has it's own needs and not only needs but wishes and preferences.I don't own Nord unfortunately, yet. But I hope I will some time soon, finally. For my needs, workstation would be the go for keyboard, for making my own music quick and easy, but for my live sessions, church and so on... Nord is the one and only to go (in my opinion).So to finally get to the point I wanted to say: there can be many keyboards that can share some important features that matter to you, but there is a catch, there must be something that you need more from one keyboard than the other. So if sound quality of new Nautilus is great (and I'm sure it is), probably piano sound can be very close to Nord's one or the same for example, but don't forget that Nord is keyboard made for live playing. Nord will give you something that no other keyboard can give you in such way. It's up to you what you need for you keyboard. If that's live playing, I would say stay with Nord because sound difference can't be so drastic. Nord is top class keyboard and has one of the best piano samples and more... think twice before you decide.Sorry for long comment, I hope I helped somehow.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=136333&sid=6bca72d02f572cbf304f0948630da96d#p136333

And had to change that pattern several times, because I changed my mind what this instrument would have to be for.There was no flat ""Roland"" but only disctinct models of different brands (no matter which) - about a dozen, some of which I haven't seen in real life to the very day. So what do you want to compare the NS3 to - an RD2000?And I did a second thing: Test those models I was most interested in. With different sorts of music and in different moods. Multiple times for an hour or two. And as I wasn't satisfied with the choice my dealer had for me, I sat in my car and made my way to another one two and a half hours away. And in the end, there was not only a small list of deviced that would have more or less met my needs, but also something I was in love with because I had the impression it would support my playing and push me further and make me more creative. It was a Stage 3 (Compact).In that process, I found out that I wouldn't find a keybed to really play piano and organ with in a satisfying way. I had to decide which way I would want to go. I now play the piano via an older 2nd keyboard with my Stage sounds (via MIDI and DualKB mode).But as you say you'd need quite a number of sounds: Please investigate yourself if you are willing to build/adapt sounds, too. Because you can buy instruments with 1000s of sounds onboard. Or you can buy a Nord with prepared raw material and some dozens of examples of sounds to manipulate and play with and create your own sounds with all the knobs and switches a Stage 3 has. Even with the pianos and organ sounds on the Stage 3, you'll have to play a bit until you'll be pleased. It surely will have to be modelled after being purchased until it's your personal musical tool (probably the same with others, too). But maybe then you'll be floating on your own acoustic stream like I am.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=133177&sid=6bca72d02f572cbf304f0948630da96d#p133177

Surf and classic rock, mostly pianos and organs, keep it simple, sound good, etc. -- that's an Electro 6.  The Electro doesn't have the full synth section, nor the dual A and B panels with three instruments each -- but it has most of the other great Stage goodness.I've played mostly Nords since the Electro 3 was a thing.  They are definitely performance oriented, but aren't slouches when recording either.  You don't really ""program"" sounds on a Nord -- you usually start with a good basic sound and then tweak a handful of knobs until it sounds good to your ears.  Save it if you like, and you're on to the next thing.Where the Stage 3 works well for me (as compared to an Electro) is being able to handle just about anything a local bar band might want to play, and then some.  One board to rule them all, so to speak.  If the Stage can't recreate a particular signature sound, there are literally thousands of user-created samples available.One example?  We had to learn Uptown Funk and I was expected to bring all the flashy sounds (doh-dohs, handclaps, shouts, etc.).  Sure enough, a kind soul on this forum had created just what I needed.  I just had to remember what key to press when.  We played the song live exactly once, and that was that.I have tried the various Rolands over the years.  They deliver a ton of sonic firepower cost-effectively.  They have their ardent fans, as you'd expect.

My situation probably has little in common with yours, but it’s another data point for you perhaps. The primary alternative competition for my money was the Korg Kronos. I am totally a hobbyist and only use the keyboard for practicing and for enjoyment, so I don’t fit a profile that is very helpful to you. My only playing outside of the home is at church where I play prelude once or twice a month and play the synth in the worship set every second week or so. The church has a very nice 7 foot Yamaha grand that I use for prelude and a Yamaha S90XS that serves as the “make big fat stringy/synth sound to fill in the gaps” machine. As a minor/secondary data point, it is worth pointing out that I am the person who chose that S90XS a few years ago. If I had to make that choice now, I would absolutely choose a Nord Stage (ignoring the potential price point issue).So why did I pick the NS3 for my home purchase? I certainly didn’t “need” it. I have a 6 foot acoustic grand that I bought 20 years ago that I am still absolutely in love with. It has a wonderful touch and tone and attracts a lot of my spare time. But I’ve had a love for synthesizers that started when I was 12 years old (which was a really really long time ago). After living as a genuine and gainfully employed adult for many years, I realized I didn’t have to just love synths as a vague hands off affair. So I bought a Korg Karma synth when it was new (must have been close to 20 years ago?). I still have it and still think it is more fun than it should be. That is the main reason that a Korg Kronos was the primary alternative in my search; I think that the KARMA engine is still in those new Korg keyboards. And, holy smokes, KARMA is a fun bit of work.About 3 years ago I purchased a Sequential Circuits (Dave Smith) Prophet 6. After the Karma, that was the only synth I had purchased/owned. The Prophet 6 was a pretty big driver in leading me to get the Nord Stage. I have learned so much in terms of synthesis from that Prophet. The simplicity and hands-on programming ability with all the knobs is just fantastic. I’m sure it is not at all a fair comparison in terms of the Korg Kronos, but I never did learn how to make new sounds on the Korg Karma. It was like trying to write a user interface in assembly vs. a high level language made for that task (and I truly understand that analogy being a software developer of old and still making a living at it). I find that the Nord Stage has that same simplicity and hands on “make cool sounds with me” vibe.A few months ago I decided to replace the Yamaha P90 keyboard that I used for driving soft synths (and the Prophet and the Karma). Given my location and the lack of realistic travel options in these stupid times, I really had no way of doing any hands on testing. So I did lots of “google” research. Using the data I gained as well as the driving forces mentioned above (and the previously unmentioned fact that I fell in love with the Nord Lead 3 when it came out due to pictures and the worlds’ best demo song that I can’t find any more on the interwebs), I decided to get a Nord Stage 3.And I absolutely love it. It is truly a “musical” instrument. The sensitivity and touch of the keyboard, the amazingly beautiful sounds, and the human/machine interaction is so far beyond anything I have experienced on any other instrument. I would imagine that it cannot produce as many different sounds and do as many wonderful things as some of the big name keyboards made by Roland, Korg, etc., but I suspect that it leads the pack in terms of sheer musical beauty.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=133186&sid=6bca72d02f572cbf304f0948630da96d#p133186

If it's more traditional hymns using piano/organ ect you're probably fine there. If it's newer stuff (Hillsong, Bethel, Elevation, ect) then you'll probably want something with more synth capabilities. The other option is to keep the Electro and add a midi controller w/ computer and an interface. This would let you do more atmospheric sounds/synths with using a DAW like Ableton or Mainstage, while keeping the Electro. If you don't have any of this equipment yet then that would be another expense. I've wrestled with the same decision and ultimately decided on the Stage 3. I already have all of the other equipment necessary to run soft synths, VST's, click tracks, ect. The Electro has very limited synth capabilities, so if you're really wanting to get those modern worship sounds then using a computer based setup is really the way to go.

The Electro will give you great ""go to"" pianos, great pads and sampled synths.  No pitch bend or modulation, though.

Two of everything, including a full synth section.  But you may not need all of that.I used an Electro 4D (along with a Nord Piano) for many years across classic rock, funk, roots and gospel.  It was more than enough for what I needed at the time.The move to the Stage 3 Compact was mostly driven by playing in a wider variety of bands which included more complex sounds including lead synth parts.  Add a weighted controller, and I'm ready for most any gig you can imagine.  Song mode is brilliant for keeping set lists organized, right now I have about 250 songs in there across three bands.If you're concerned about buyer's regret after a while, then I'd say take the plunge on a S3.

Bless u guys[/quote]OK, I come from an English style of worship as a church organist for catholic and anglican churches, so my work load differs a lot. I'm spending a lot of time trying to get programming and sampling done to build a series of church organ libraries for the stage 3.I was in a similar mind to you in this respect of the stage 3. Now, as said previously by the gang here, take note of the SW73 vs HP76 vs HA-88. the SW73 is the same action as the Electro 61 and 73 series, waterfall, so it's near to playing a hammond organ, it's not a true weighted action, more a semi-weighted and as such you can do a few interesting bits with it, but it doesn't feel right if you're more the seasoned pianist, that's where the HP76 and HA88 stage 3 come in.  If I were in your shoes, I'd go for the 88. you've said that your lowest known piece so far is Low D, transposing is per octave and not per semi-tone as I remember but that said, this really depends on what you're playing.The Stage 3 in my honest opinion is worth the investment. the Stage 3-88 with a nord stage 3 case, the stand, unless you go for something more flexible for holding a 2nd board, etc, you're pretty much kitted out. the organ section is really nice for the hammonds, etc so really worth sticking to. Yes, it's a slight learning curve at first but trust me, compared to the yamaha CP88, this BEATS THE HOO HAH out of it hands down in my opinion. I played a CP88 and I felt like a lower class hooker lol it felt cheap.I suppose if you were of the mind to, look at the stage 3 as your master keyboard, look for some rack sound modules from Roland, yamaha, etc then you have a real power house. That's what I'm rebuilding at the moment, slowly.Good luck.lew",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=124683&sid=6bca72d02f572cbf304f0948630da96d#p124683

By that time, however, Linux had come into use so I went to that pretty much exclusively until the late 90s when DAW software appeared.  Since my background had been in hacking together computers from scratch - partially due to hobby interests, partially due to money concerns (you could always get way more Intel/PC hardware for the same cost as Mac stuff) - I went with Windows to run Cakewalk Pro Audio. I always maintained a Windows PC for that, and I still have Windows 7 running on my studio computer with Sonar X1 now.

No fudging latencies nearly as much as with PC hardware.Now, everything is possible on either platform, and either one you get will certainly work, but after 25 years of putting these things together and making them do things they shouldn't be doing, I'm converting to Mac for my day-to-day home computing and 'family' computing, and for any music production that happens outside of my studio control room desk.  So, the Mac is with me inside the studio and on the road when I gig to record the shows.For me, a big part of it is time, I am too busy with the bands, work and chasing two tiny band members around to hack at things anymore.

If you buy a Mac Mini and use a monitor you already have, you'll have a better specced machine. Still, a Mac Mini with a dual-core 2.7 GHz Intel Core i7 and 8 GB of RAM already costs 860 pounds.I like a Mac because it generally just works (and I'm a bit of a UNIX geek, only slightly) but I really don't mind using Windows 7, I quite like it actually. One thing that's more of a problem with a PC than a Mac: if you keep installing all kinds of crap on it, it becomes slow and unstable. Ideally you'd use your 'music' PC for music, or at least not for games and lots of internet browsing, testing software, etc. Question is: is that viable. You could also just reinstall Windows and your music software every 6-12 months, that should solve that too.I'd say go for a Mac Mini or even better yet, the Windows PC you mentioned, leaving room for a decent audio interface (I really like my Focusrite i2i - small, sturdy, Focusrite quality and excellent sound), monitors, etc. You don't need a super fast graphics card for music software, so that'll free up an easy 60-150 pounds. You could even go for a very quiet PC, especially since you don't need a fast graphics card or a big, honking 1200 watt power supply.

Even though they are very highly praised, they are not without their faults, just like PCs. My brother right next to me has his iPhone doing random reboots and his macbook pro randomly ejecting the disc while not in use. I am not trying to say mac is worse, just pointing out that getting a Mac does not mean you will never experience issues. Also, getting a PC does not instantly mean troubles. I lived in Germany for about 2 months and a half with just my WIn7 netbook, constantly surfing the internet, without antivirus. I have yet to experience trouble. If you know how to give maintenance to your Windows 7 computer (for example, the only thing I do is run CCleaner on startup), and avoid installing a load of useless programs, you'll be more than fine.I would go for a custom made, Windows 7 PC. But do try to get the Windows 7 Ultimate x64, as that one is the most stable. Another advantage of Windows is compatibility.To keep it short I would get:Windows 7 Ultimate x64Intel Core i7-3770A Gigabyte GA-Z77X-UD5H-WB Motherboard (has wifi, firewire, USB3 and SATA3) or an equivalent Gigabyte Motherboard16GB or RAM1TB SATAIII HDDBluRay Disc DriveA very good audio interface (can be USB3, Firewire or PCIe)A Samsung Monitor (screen)Logitech mouse and keyboardAll of that (not including the audio inteface) could be had for about $1,200 USD on Amazon.com or around 800 GBP, if I checked correctly. And that is not your average computer, that would be a short a video card of being a supercomputer. You could buy a cheaper mobo, or a cheaper processor and have a more than good computer. In fact, yesterday I bought 2 computer for around 430 GBP for work, they got a more than capable processor and are quite speedy.Saludos,Gustavo",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=20285&sid=6bca72d02f572cbf304f0948630da96d#p20285

For example, if you enlarge the font on a Windows machine (Mac would have the same problem) some web sites aren't very usable anymore. Instead of basing sizes (i.e., where to place menus, etc.) on the font size of the user viewing the page, the web designer assumed everyone was using the same font size as him/her (often 12 pixels) and just reserves a fixed amount of room (in pixels) for menus, etc. If you enlarge your font and visit web sites that were (arguably badly) designed like that, you'll have problems with text being obscured by other text, graphics, etc.This video might have some solutions that work for you:If all else fails, you could just install Windows on the iMac and turn it into a very expensive Windows machine",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=20333&sid=6bca72d02f572cbf304f0948630da96d#p20333

Then jump from July 2012 to December 2014…True, and this is often mentioned on discussion forums when people revive old threads, but my take is that you are not answering just the OP, but 1000+ other people who may have the same question. Also what was a valid answer 2 years ago may not still be accurate.So instead of a subjective answer, i'll try to lay out the facts, and anyone can then make a better informed choice rather than be a victim of marketing hype.I've used (and use) Windows, Mac and Linux professionally as a software designer, for many years. For my music I use both Mac and PC: A MacBook Pro because it is the bestportableoption IMHO, and a custom built desktop PC because it is certainly the cheapeststudiooption (and may even be better than Mac - read on...). The bottom line IMHO is that all have their merits. Let's look at hardware first:A Mac is a Mac, is a Mac. It's a piece of hardware that has well designed and documented specifications. It has some 3rd party components that are chosen carefully or have even been specially designed for Apple. In this respect, it's just like your Nord Lead.A PC *may* also be well designed and spec'd to the same degree, but (even if it has a badge like HP or Sony on it) it can be any combination of a billion OEM motherboards, drives, RAM, IO devices etc. which conform to a variety of different specs. Sometimes these are changed midway through a production run, even in identical models like a Sony Vaio X or a Lenovo Y. If you get one made from the right components, then it is likely at least as good as a Mac, and very likely better. If you buy one that is not fit for your needs, it will let you down. That's why I recommended in an earlier post that if you go the PC route, you buy one from a maker who understands the requirements of music production.In terms ofhardware, Mac is the safe option, but may be a more expensive one. It's not just the initial cost, but also consider how often you need to replace it... maybe every 3 to 5 years depending on your specific demands on performance.Thesoftwareside of it is ultimately preference. I prefer Mac OSX to Windows, but I am not going to say it is better - some things are better in Windows. Some software like Logic Pro is only on Mac, and others may only be on Windows, but stuff like Cubase and Ableton Live is available for both, so that may influence your decision.A word on Linux:I may create a few enemies by saying this, but I would never seriously consider Linux for music production or recommend it to anyone who isn't a programmer. Yes it's free, but your time isn't, and trust me, you will spend hours searching on the web and typing complex commands into a terminal window in order to install a module to fix a problem, only to discover you break many other things. It will destroy your workflow and burn entire evenings of your life (even more than Windows does). You will become more knowledgeable about compiling java code, and you will play less music which is what you wanted it for in the first place!Some of this is inevitably my opinion, but i've tried to be objective and honest.

What you mention above about linux was particularly so a few years back. I remember SuSE 8.0 was a pain to install.But nowadays there are a few arts-oriented distributions that work straight from a DVD or USB stick, without the need to install anything. One is Ubuntu Studio, the other is Musix, there might be more.

Yeah you can reduce the resolution and thus making everything a bit bigger but also more out of focus, what's the point of having a retina display then? DUH!The point of a retina display is PRECISELY to make exactly that possible WITHOUT diminishing the displayed quality. You do NOT lose any focus at all.This has never been possible with any desktop display previously and is due to the fact that Apple doesn't interpolate the ""effective"" resolution, but actually renders FOUR TIMES the selected resolution (x2 in both dimensions) and interpolates THAT into the retina screen.The results are completely beyond anything else on the market.The whole reason behind Apple's retina displays on Macs is that it makes them completely resolution-independent. Scale the screen to whatever you want, and it will still look sharp and crisp beyond what your eye can discern at normal viewing distance.EDIT 2: It's worth noting that when shark posted the above, the iMac 27"" didn't HAVE a retina display.

I used a Roland XV-5050 with my Electro 3 as its MIDI controller for several years. This is because I preferred to pre-define keyboard split and sound setups in what are called a ""Studio Set"" on an Integra 7. Not everyone wants to do it this way, but it works for me because of the way I do things: I only use predefined settings during a gig.One thing that the Roland Integra 7 (and the FA-06/07/08) are really good at is supporting custom splits. A single ""Studio Set"" can have up to 16 parts, each with its own separate low key limit, high key limit, transposition, and sound/tone selection. The Nord Stage cannot get anywhere near this.I upgraded from my XV-5050 to a Roland FA-07, but I still use it with the same philosophy (I pre-define all sound and split settings in Studio Sets). For me the FA-07 is a good complement to my Nord because of the FA-07's superior split capabilities and a lot of useful synth sounds, horn sounds and others.The way I use highly customized splits is not common, and probably will not matter for your needs.I don't know anything about the capabilities of the Motif XF6, so I don't have a useful opinion on whether an Integra 7 would add anything that the Motif XF6 cannot do.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=132386&sid=6bca72d02f572cbf304f0948630da96d#p132386

Optimized for organ or trying to be playable also for pianos?) and the quality of their new organ emulation: historically Yamaha has been very lacking in this respect, but this new organ sounds pretty good to me on a quick listen on cell phone speakers. We'll see how it performs in real life.Price-wise it's not really cheap but I trust Yamaha stuff to be built like a tank and this looks to be a very solid all-around product.

You can only add effects and splits/layers, change the ADR and save to a Live Set.  Live sets can be backed up and restored, but not sounds.With a street price $1,999 (only $200 less than an Electro), I guess the appeal will be for those who definitively prefer the built-in sounds and want pitch-bend and modulation controls.Within the Yamaha line, other than the Organ you can get everything else with exponentially greater flexibility and functionality in a MODX6 for $1,399 and add a dedicated organ module for a similar total price.Again, I could be missing something and future updates could add new capabilities, but IMHO, I'm not seeing how this is worth 2x the price of a VR09 or 90% of an Electro 6.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=126006&sid=6bca72d02f572cbf304f0948630da96d#p126006

For the following reasons :1. Yamaha build quality is excellent. I've owned several Yamaha keyboards that have given many years of service with ZERO problems. Digital pianos/home keyboards/ stage keyboards. I trust the build 100% for at least 10 years of use absolute minimum. They are 'built to last' in my experience.2. The fact you can't load sounds can be a good thing. If a major part of the attraction of a product is the fact you can load/swap sounds, this gives the company the opportunity to stop supporting that model with their software after a few years. So you can no longer have this major feature, and have to upgrade. Apple do this type of thing, they enforce their agenda on you. With a 'stand-alone' product, you just buy it, as it is, and that's it. You just keep it.3. Overall, a new product like the Yamaha gives great competition to other brands like Nord - and will be good for customers because it means Nord have to give an excellent service otherwise customers will jump ship.So, I say - well done Yamaha!

You certainly answered the question about what I may have been missing in my initial impression.  My opinion on value was based upon the NE6 having two flagship-quality engines (Piano and Organ) while the YC had one (Organ).  Assuming the organs are of similar quality, I thought that the limitations of the YC synth engine kept it from closing the gap the NE6 had with the Pianos, although with your additional info, the two units seem closer in value that I originally thought.I seem to be in the minority, but as a Yamaha fan since my DX7-IIFD days, my initial enthusiasm for the YC was based upon the expectation that it was going to be a $1,399 MODX with an upgraded organ engine for $600 more, making it a flagship organ with flagship synth engine. Instead, the synth functionality (while still useful and superior to the NE6) was hobbled more than I expected.Again, great info.

I find myself searching for buttons and knobs as I play the Electro.Also, I have figured out the Electro MIDI implementation to get the lower manual working with the help of MIDI OX and it works great once it is up and running, but it does not seem like a good general solution for the types of gigs I play.I am not a dedicated organist and generally play two to four parts during a song, for instance strings, synth lead and electric piano.  Consequently I have yet to gig with this keyboard.I think the build quality is excellent and the sound engines are excellent as well.I won't be trading the Electro for a YC-61 anytime soon, but I think there's a reason people use them as a dedicated organ only and not a general purpose synth.I think the CP4 suffers somewhat from the same issue.

You might also look for a smaller Korg ROMpler.

I can only recommend listening online to samples for whatever's available used and at a good price in your local area, and then putting your hands on the unit yourself and making sure it's got what you're looking for.

If you pick up a Roland XV, in my opinion you will really need to get an SRX-07 expansion card.One challenge is that Roland never updated the software for the XV to officially support Windows 7 and above or the latest MACs. You can do a workaround to get their software running on Windows 7 and 8, not sure about 10. I recently decided to upgrade to a Roland FA-07, which has all the XV sounds and includes a 73-key keyboard. The Roland Integra-7 module has all the same capability in terms of splits, but with more built-in sounds.

For example, right angle connectors will allow you to place the back of your keyboard closer to a wall. In live configurations they can help reduce the stress on the connectors as the cable isn't pulling like a lever on the back of the connector.In some cases its just an aesthetic to keep the wiring clean.For example I have a multi-wire snake connected to my pedal board for volume, expression, Leslie, and sustain pedals. The end of that cable is a tail with right angle connectors so they don't stick out from the back of my rig.

There are a few user samples like that on the Nord Sample section of this forum or in other Nord Electro discussions.

I've read the manuals and other posts I can find about this, but still can't really grasp how to do what I am trying to do. I am using a Nord Stage 3 to record into Pro Tools. My main goal is to record the MIDI data and actual sounds from the Nord into pro tools. This is so I can easily edit/quantize the data, but still use the sound from the Nord and not some VST plugin. Right now I have my Nord plugged into my computer via USB and into my Focusrite 2i2 with an instrument cable. From what I understand I need to record the MIDI data first and then somehow re-record it once it is edited/quantized with the sound I want, but I'm not sure how to do that. Right now I have a MIDI track open in pro tools, which makes it so that I can record my MIDI data and since I also have my Nord plugged into my interface via instrument cable, I am able to hear my track back with whatever sound I have open on the Nord. This is where I am stuck. I want to be able to record that MIDI data back with the Nord sound so that it is actually saved on a track. If I were to turn off my Nord, my MIDI track wouldn't play any sounds back. I may be doing this all totally wrong, but I just can't seem to figure out any way to record audio onto that MIDI track and save it so that if I turn off my Nord, the audio from the Nord is still playing on the audio track.

If it could get me through a gig in a pinch if my NE was out of commission (I'm talking emergency situations here!), even better...I spent a lot of time with an RD-800 and I think Roland's piano, EP and synth sounds are pretty good.I like the Juno DS a lot, and I personally prefer it to the FA, but based on what you've said, I think FA is probably better for you. The Roland FA has the SuperNatural pianos/EPs so those sounds would be more like the RD800's than the DS pianos/EPs would be. FA also has a better synth section (again, their SuperNatural synth) than the DS has. As an NE replacement, the FA also has better organ than the DS. FA-06 and DS61 have the same action, which is just okay... noticeably stiffer toward the rear of the keys. (Korg Kross has the same issue.) From a posting elsewhere:FA OVER DS:* SuperNatural sounds... VA synth engine, tonewheel organ engine, piano, EPs, clav, basses, acoustic guitar, ensemble strings, drums* built-in full sequencer* ability to load two expansion sets at once (instead of only one)* Stereo Sub Out to send selected sounds to alternate external processing/locations* Large color display* Can put MFX effects on up to 16 sounds at once (instead of 3)... though unlike the DS, you can't put more than one on a sound a a time* Functions as a 16-zone MIDI controller* more trigger/select pads (though their functions between the two boards are not identical)* ability to save many more user sounds/combinations... 512 User Studio Sets vs. 128 Performances; 896 tones (split among different categories) vs. 256 patchesDS OVER FA:* ability to load custom samples as full keyboard-playable instruments (this can also be used as a way to partially get around being only able to load one expansion instead of two)* ability to change performances (equivalent of FA's Studio Sets) without your previous sound cutting out* ability to put 2 or 3 insert (MFX) effects on a single sound (but you cannot put MFX on 16 sounds at once like you can on the FA... 3 is the max if you assign one MFX to each. Effects on 16 channels is more important for sequencing than live performance, so it's a difference that makes sense since the FA has the 16 part sequencer and the DS doesn't.)* when playing live with a 2-way split, you can easily adjust the volumes and octaves of each part on the fly with the front panel sliders and octave buttons (it's great to be able to quickly switch the octave of your RH sound when playing LH bass, for example... not so easy on the FA)* vocal processor (i.e. pitch correction)* You may find the DS basic sound set preferable. Apart from the SuperNatural sounds, the FA sounds are from the XV-5080, while the Juno DS sounds are newer (Fantom and up). Plus axial even gives DS owners a way to add the FA's XV-5080 sounds if you need them, but you can't add the DS/Fantom sounds to the FA.* DS has a pattern sequencer (of course FA has its own sequencers, but each can be better for different things)* Roland has a Mac/PC editor/librarian for DS* DS has a front panel MFX control* Numeric entry works more smoothly, it repurposes the Favorites/Selection buttons (instead of the pads as on the FA), so it doesn't get in the way of your using the pads for other purposes; and as soon as you finish entering a number, the buttons revert to their previous function, whereas on the FA, once you use the pads for numbers, you have to use a multi-button sequence to manually switch out to get back to your normal pad function.As for the Kross, I think it's most significant advantages over the comparably priced Juno DS are in the sequencer and its MIDI options for controlling other gear, and that it's smaller/lighter. Which has better sounds is subjective. I prefer the DS for the seamless sound switching, the better independent control of your left and right sounds when doing a split, and the ability to load custom keyboard-playable samples (actually better than Nord there, as the samples can have multiple velocity layers).For your needs of synth leads/pads, vocoder, and emergency Electro 5 replacement, at low cost... I think these are probably the best options.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=115968&sid=b224f77ef25dccce833121a4028abd8a#p115968

My summary: The Electro has better sounds for Organ, Wurli, and EP. The FA has much better splits capability than even the Stage, and has a nice collection of sounds that are useful in covers band in its ""EXP-02"" collection. Nord has better acoustic piano sounds, but Roland FA has a usable mono AP sound which sits well in the mix in a covers band, even when used in mono, even though it sounds yucky when played standalone.Many people dislike the FA-06 because how its black keys respond when played closer to the back of the keys.

Since 1 year I Play in a Reggae Band. We have a lot of fun and are progressing well. I have two very old Keyboards and at least i want to Switch one of them into a new one. Because there are less and less physical stores where I can try them and get some answers to my questions I ask here for your advice.My Budget is up to 3500 Euro or 4000 Dollars at highest. The Keyboard Needs to be good with Piano, E-Piano and Organ Sounds.. also the Clavinet or similar sounds are nice to have. On top we also Play a lot of Dub. So some effects, hall, delay wold be necessary too.

If your primary focus is Piano I would go for the Nord Stage 3-88, if it's primarily organ and synthe sound and just a few piano sounds the Nord Stage 3 Compact would be the best choice. The third one, Nord Stage 3 HP 76, is a somewhat compromise between both if Pianos and Organs are equally important and if the weight of the 88 model is too much.(In Deutsch: ich denke dass der Nord Stage 3 die beste Wahl aus dem Angebot von Nord für deine Zwecke ist.

Would be nice to see a competitor focus on selling just the action, but it's not likely that you'll see much different from what's already out there unless somebody's willing to invest the R&D into a totally new action - and then they have to be sure to pay it off with future sales. Fatar might, but so far there's not much impulse for them to do so it seems. And Roland etc... might not see enough sales in their future to completely reinvent the action - or maybe they've all done it and for the cost/weight it's not as significant an improvement over what they have now to be worth even trying to market.Making a good keyboard action is in fact quite a challenge since people learn and play all kinds and thus the demand is highly fragmented, the production costs are high, and the ""more acoustic like"" actions get quite heavy, and thus lose the sales to people for whom single-handedly transporting them is the ultimate priority (which I gather is the bulk of the stage keyboard market).I would really not hold your breath for any kind of real HA keys that are an improvement on the TP-100 unless you already know of some existing in a currently shipping product. And with the Electro line being specifically focused on keyboards that never had an HA action to begin with, it's even less likely coming from Nord to be found in that particular instrument/engine, since portability is a major segmentation differentiator for that line.Not trying to rain on your parade, but it helps to have realistic expectations so you're not disappointed every year.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=113022&sid=b224f77ef25dccce833121a4028abd8a#p113022

Apparently its an italian company but its a couple of ex Roland guys behind it all.From their website they do a range of different instruments, 68, 73, 88 key stage boards and some home piano cabinet style pianos. All appear to have the same sound engine and they look pretty smart and nicely put together. They, just like Nord are also using the FATAR keybeds in all models.After watching some demo's on Youtube I went to my local music shop to have a play of one. They had the 'home' cabinet piano on display and I spent 20 minutes or so on it. Have to say, very nice connection to sound when playing. The samples are very clean and crisp and pleasant, BUT I cant say it totally blew me away either. Hard to say how it would mix or sound live from the test.The 'VIVO Grand' is their main sample (not sure what piano it actually samples) and then there is some other pianos you can select within, Bright, Classic, etc. Although they are supposed to be samples of different pianos I couldn't help but feel like it was EQ'd and tweaked versions of the same piano sampleset. There didnt appear to be any major change in character like you get between the different Nord Pianos we are used to.I was looking with particular interest at the S1 which in its description promised a very compact 68 weighted key A-E layout in a smart and lightweight package, 1/3 lighter than the Nord Piano2HP/Stage2EX76. I asked the shop to get me one out so that I could test it and to my dismay it turns out the action was not weighted at all... 'semi weighted' at best and was quite disappointing. I just cant get on playing piano without properly weighted keys, it feels like a cheap toy to me (and it isnt a cheap instrument at around £1000). So I didnt buy one basically.To get properly weighted action you would have to look to the 73 key model (S3) which has the same FATAR keybed as the Nord HP models or the 88 variants (S7/S9) which have a full hammer action, probably again similar to Nord HA.Not sure your reasons for looking towards Dexibell? They arent bad.. the 68 key model would have been a perfect quick jam session board for me and if it had a proper action I would have bought it to supplement my Stage 3. But in summary I think from someone used to a premium instrument like the Nord you wont find a lot from Dexibell to make you want to swap to them instead.Hope that helps",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=105787&sid=b224f77ef25dccce833121a4028abd8a#p105787

It has certainly helped quell any further interest for now.I'm always on the fence about looking at new products.

I own an Electro 4D, but the 61 keys and organ action are not always suitable for piano playing. I'm currently interested in the new Yamaha P-121 piano.

The second Matrix is also a good deal, we'll 600 Can$ but I wanted to experiment with their link/dual unit functions that are very nice...So, a bit of rationality for buying them as some Box to get the extra sounds that was not a strength of the Stage 2 but also a bit of nostalgia, so, yes, it could have and still could be done, maybe with the just the XV5080 for the Rompler Sounds.For the NL2X it was different:I had planned to buy a 2X and a C2 the first day I bought my Stage 2 because, as opposed to people who are always complaining that the Stabe isn't the best in Organ or Sytnh, I understood the philosophy or Nord, having one unit doing the best for a specific purpose and the Stage being a good all in one but not the best for each of its 3 engines...But maybe, I would have not bought a 2X if I hadn't find a special edition, with the black key, it was so cool....And still, a ""patate"", we say in French, a power of output in any of its presets and the easiness of use that I was blown away with...So, with Stage 2, Matrix, Proteus and C2, I was all set, remember, step by step, few $ amount each time with analog ""ish"" stuff: I know that now the Mateix is always in the list of underestimate old analog synth, ditto with the Proteus with its Z filter (that I don't use a lot these days for sure as I'm gigging with a classic Pure dance /Funk sound...)All that stuff was in the studio first and I was getting to start recording with a computer borrowed from my university...But all my planned went havoc when they did!n't renew my contract so, I had to find a job, I was alone for 3 years, seeing my family 3 weeks per day only and continuing my ""journey"" on synth and music"" was kind of a remedy  for me to not being complete depressed/mad etc....And as I couldn't bring the other pieces of studio equipments that I had, I restarted giging with this set up, Stage 2 plus the 3 sounds  Xander's, Matrix, Proteus and XV5080 and was very happy with that.But the devil was pushing my GAZ in proposing me a C2, used, in a store with the guaranty, at the exact time the C2D was getting its last update transferable to the C2 for a price of 1700 Can$ with the Nord C2 gig bag included...As I had already two Ocean beach drawbars for the Stage 2, yes, I bought it, for me it was a ""too good to pass on deal"" when the C2D was at that time around 5000/6000 Can$....And then I thought I was  good and when I was asking about a Rrophet 08 on this forum, I got a lot of answer that the Matrux and P08 was bringing the same kind of analog sound, the P08 being way more easy to tweak than my Matrix so, I was close not to Buy it or to buy it and sell the matrix...But again, when the Prophet 6 was realeased a lot of store/guys jumped on it like crazy and I got mine at 30% less than it's original price so, again, I was making me happy with having the synth of my dream, a Prophet 5 kind of that I had been lusting after since the 80's but was completely out of my league....For the Prohet 12, it's the same: at 2700 Can$, I considered it a too good too pass on plan when I saw it at Long and Mac Quade online from a different store....Well, I Had to finance it last year and I'm still paying for it but it help me to not buy any P6 or OB6...So after a long explanation on why (features wise) I bought them and why I kept them all (nostalgia wise), I will answer precisely to your question:Yes, I could gig with the Stage 2 only : that's what I going to do with my classic rock band, they don't even realized when I turn down completely both outputs of my Tascam mixer so, not being in my personal monitors neither in the PA and wedges we practice with after having been told that I was too loud...It was the first time I was dialing myself in the PA and their monitors...And they said I was freaking too loud so, I turned down everything....but when I asked, they said, ""yes, perfect, great now....I was ""ghost"" playing on my keys with no sound at all, nothing in my monitor, nothing with the PA, for 45 min, 5 songs!!! So, they don't deserve more than just one board, C2 Organ for songs that requires heavy organ parts and Stage only when it will be more a bit of other sounds for a classic Rock song...they don' t deserve more....But for my new band, yes, maybe the P12 only would suffice but seriously, it doesn't sound at all like the P08, the P08 is really more ""raw"" and I cannot decide to part with it...The easiness of the P12 for tweaking sound helped me a lot to come back more to the P08 than ever now...Yeah, so, could I do it without the Nord lead? The sound is really different as well and man, it's the legacy of the first Nord, kind of where it all starts....abd black keys....like in the pack rat cartoons series in ""keyboard magazine""...So, Mainstage plus Stage 2 would suffice for most of the case but I don't want to have a computer, I just bought a used IMac to replace my 11 years old PC but it took me so many time to learn my gear and the nostalgia/typical sound/great deal I had on them is telling me not to change completely my set up that I'm very familiar with....and that I still have a lot to learn from, for years....Z filter to use with the Proteus, full control of the Mateix with a hardware controller, deep digging into the P08 and P12, all that stuff I will do when I couldn't gig anymore when I will too old and will have to stay in the studio only....Note that my TX802 is coming from my 20's as well as my D50 which is still a crazy board to use, not only for great classic songs sound from the 80's but also because it's my second kb controller on top of the stage, the NL2x keybed has nothing to do in term of playability with the D50 keybed, the NL2X keybed is a joke compared to it....So, in use, I could divide by two my set up and have almost the same features/sound but:1) I will loose the happiness coming from my nostalgia of my old days when I was a teen, now I have a unit from all the ""big one"" ones at that time, EMU, Oberheim and Dave Smith...The Aesthetic of the rig is so beautiful that when I'm depressed and it has happens quite a lot since my paragliding accident two years ago that it's kind of a medicine for me to stare at them and play them, I think music and my crazy set up saved my life for the last 2 years in helping me not to do a ""bad thing""...And seriously, it helps a lot to get great paid gig, when customers saw it they accept our price of 1500$ minimum, they feel that they get the VIP treatment...As a conclusion, well, you're right, even if the different in personality are not that different, they still all have their unique sound and features, but I don't really need all of them at a gig....Sorry for the long answer but sometimes, craziness has  still a bit of rationality....But seriously, are we really ratio able when we play synths? One of the greatest impact on modern music for the past 30 years, staring in the 80's, after what guitar and bass did to modern music for 40 years, it's all synths now...Week, It's ""Indy"" in the the movie when is ready to blow the ""arch"" to get Marion back....He's told that he's not following history, he's part of the history....Well, I'm now part of the history as well....He finally didn't blow the Arch so, I don't blow/sell my synths/Expanders....Is that rational what I just said??",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=101996&sid=f802187e18465db6598dcffa8af10379#p101996

I've only had it and a Lead A1, so I'm not sure exactly what's meant there.  As an owner of three other VCO/VCA synths, it doesn't sound like them, no.  But it is a wall of sound and between the Lead 3 and Rack 3, there's a tremendous amount of polyphony available.  I also like that the Lead 3 has aftertouch, it's the only Lead that does.  I'm rather surprised the Lead 4 does not have aftertouch.Update: It only took me half a morning to re-evaluate my decision to sell the rev2, in light of shipping the Stage 3 88 to its new home.  I still might part with the rev2, but not until after the Prophet X is actually here (first week in June, 8Dio tells me).  I like the extra octave and the Prophet-6 is limited w/ six voices.  You don't particularly care when you're playing it, but it is a real limitation.  How I think of the P6 is as an extra voice on a Prophet-5 that never needs fixing and sports class-compliant USB MIDI.  For those who don't know, the original Prophet-5 sound library is included in a Prophet-6.  The Prophet-6 is just fun.

The minimoog and rev2 are roughly at a piano height for that chair, otherwise I tend to play everything standing up when it's all on.  I tried a spider stand in the corner but it took up way too much room for just two, the 90 degree angle with the K&M Omega stands works better.  I may replace the desk with something that will hold an 88 note keyboard, but behind the chair is a nice view, so I prefer to have the piano / MIDI controller there.

I guess I'll look at the MP11 a little closer.  It's also dawning on me, slowly, that piano and MIDI controller are really different things, thinking about the time-based aftertouch in the SL88 Grand; I suppose it's unreasonable to expect something that does both well.  I am trying to learn piano, so that's another vote for Kawai.The MIDI Beams work well, just remember to turn off the transmitter when you're done, it's not smart enough to power itself down.  The receiver has USB power so it's not a problem.  Mine's probably 10m (30') away through lots of glass.  I'm using Outlaw Audio OAW4 for the wireless audio.  They work, but both sides require USB power.  I had them sitting around for home audio and tried them just for fun.  With a second laptop running Apple Remote Desktop, I can even control Ableton from the room with the Lead 3.  There's no real point to doing this, it's just an excuse to play with toys.  I mostly use the Lead 3 on headphones.Another keybed I like, which I throw out just as a data point, is the Korg SV-1.  It's not graded and I don't know if it's a triple sensor (and rather doubt it because all it says is weighted hammer action), but it feels really nice to play and the EP voices in the SV-1 are very warm.  Another thing I'd be tempted to pick up if I had enough space.End of day ramblings: I'm coming around on the Kawai MP11SE.  I think that might be my Stage replacement.

There are a couple of things that could happen with your original - keys will wear out or break after heavy use and you can have replacement keys available, but it takes time to take it apart and fix (or may have to go to a repair shop). Also, not sure about the D50 but most synths have some kind of battery that stores the presets and it will ultimately need to be replaced. Some synths have the battery soldered in and you may want a pro doing this type of work for you. You could also run across other random issues due to age. Having a backup would give you continuity if one unit needs to be in the shop.I've had my Roland JX8P since 1985 and it is still working just fine. I do not use it for gigs. The only things I've done over the years is replacing a few black keys that have broken (I have a box full of spares acquired from Roland many years ago). I had a technician replace the battery as well, after about 20 years. I also had the aftertouch updated at that same time - it previously worked, but just barely. Now it is great.Another thing to consider if you just want the D50 sounds would be the Roland Boutique D05 module.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=96616&sid=f802187e18465db6598dcffa8af10379#p96616

The rhythm must come from the gut, not the machine.Thank you for clarifying!IMO, playing in time is not just ""rhythm"", but also a feel for the tempo. Gut feel over click, I do agree with. But even so, training is necessary to get a good feel for tempos, since tempo can be absolutely essential for the feel of a groove.How do you train your gut to have a good feel for tempo but by playing to a metronome/click?Also, gut-feel groove is all wonderful, but the basic reality of much of a musician's work is working with a click. And even when it's not to a click, chances are, you're overdubbing to tracks from a drummer who isn't reacting to you. You need to be able to follow that.

For a lot of music a precise rhythm is called for, but there still should be things like ritards at the end of a song or section of a song so the listener doesn’t feel an abrupt ending. This is hard to do at best when practicing with a metronome.Liberties taken with tempo to add expressivity are very subtle and do not break the rhythm, but shape melodies with emotional expression, or define sections of pieces. The more musicians that are playing together the harder it is to achieve, and maybe just ritards at the ends of sections and use of rubato and stretto in solos. A note being off by .05% as noted by the OP will not be felt as out of rhythm by the listener.Other nuances besides just rhythmic precision define a rhythm. A mazurka is a Polish dance in 3/4 time with accent on the second beat. If you accent the first beat, it will sound like a waltz.A polonaise rhythm is in 3/4 time and has a pair of 1/16 notes that lead in to the second beat which is accented. The customary style is to delay the start of the sixteenth notes and rush them. The first and second beat is still played on time, but the twin sixteenth notes that lead in to the second beat are rushed.It is true that it is important to be able to play something straight up at will without any expressive nuances before adding expressivity, or such playing will just become a form of not playing in time at all.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=101081&sid=f802187e18465db6598dcffa8af10379#p101081

The acoustic piano sound in the base XV is serviceable in a rock band gig situation, and it actually sits ok in the mix even in mono, but it will not impress anyone in a standalone situation.The split capability on the Roland XV is very good - 16 parts per ""performance"", with no limitations on how you assign patches, transpose, layer, or establish the lower and upper point for each part.  I even do creative things with a midi footpedal controller with my XV-5050, like firing off chords by pressing one key with my foot while my hands are occupied playing the sax. They will need to rip my XV out of my cold dead hands.Roland does not provide device drivers for newer versions of Windows with their XV synths, and I would guess the same is true for the older JV as well. I had to do a workaround to get my XV synth to work with Windows 7. I have read this workaround can also work with Windows 8. I have not read anything about whether it is possible to get the JV working with newer versions of Windows.The Roland Fantom was the follow-on to the XV, but the only Fantom module was pizza box size.

That's an advantage of the iPad/iPhone... less capable than PC VSTs, but if you find things that do what you want, the touchscreen approach seems a little more direct and interactive. As for separate modules, I'll agree with those who have said that the JV1010 is a very nice sounding little box. Presumably so is its successor, the XV2020, though I've never played one of those. Another to look at would be the Korg 05r/w. It's been a while since I've played either, but my recollection is that the Roland is stronger for the bread-and-butter instrument emulations (EPs, strings, brass...), and the Korg is better for the synthier stuff.

While one might need higher end monitors to do mixdowns for recordings well, moderately priced monitors will work fine for keyboard monitoring. JBL LSR305 (now replaced with 305P) would work well. It will get into more cost if you also want or need a subwoofer.For performance, you may just want a powered floor monitor to use for band practice, small venues, and floor monitoring with large installations where you may just run the keyboard through a house or band PA. For your own amplification, powered PAs from Yamaha, Electrovoice, JBL, or QSC would work. Stereo is not generally needed.Peavey keyboard amps are pretty good. They have better tweeters than the piezos used in Roland keyboard amps. Piezos have problematic high end peaks that will distort some register of the keyboard with a noticeably offensive shrill sound from accentuating the harmonic partials excessively. I’ve heard this consistently with acoustic piano patches. Otherwise, the smaller Roland keyboard amps are very convenient as practice amps.If you have a performance monitor or PA and your emphasis is performance, not recording, just using the performance equipment for home monitoring is probably ideal so you develop the nuances of playing by practicing through the system you will perform with.My $.02 worth anyway.

The lowest notes of an acoustic piano patch would be improved with a subwoofer, but are ok without it given the rapid decay of a piano tone in comparison to an organ.I use a JBL LSR2310sp subwoofer I picked up used. In a small space, a subwoofer can create more problems than it solves from boominess at frequencies reinforced by room resonance, leading one down the rabbit hole of acoustic treatment of the space.

Read: music does not pay for my food but I could not stop it without feeling sad.One of my bands is a two headed, four handed rock-electro band. Guitars + pedalboard, synths + pedalboard, drum machine and two voices. One of my keyboards is a G2, in charge of the synth harmonic parts. A Little Phatty plays the bass parts. The pedal board I use contains a RAT just for more grain, an analogue phaser, an analogue delay and a reverb. Along with the Elektron Mahcine Drum, this is the most “complicated” set-up I use.Another band is my first band we re-formed. We had played 10 years between 1994 and 2004, stopped for 11 more years and gathered again 3 years ago. Influences used to go from The Beatles to Nirvana. Now, you can guess we have even more. All in all, the music is rather energetic. In this band, I play a NE4D for pianos, Eps, organs, Clavinet and a couple of Mellotrons sounds along with a drummer, a bass player, a guitarist-singer, and I do seconds vocals too. I use it along with a Little Phatty and a couple of stompboxes (RE20 and Tech21 Blonde for that matters). The NE4D Rhodes and Clavinets are often highjacked to fill the spectrum as a second guitar would. The LP sometimes doubles bass as a… big-overdriven-sound-machine : )The last band is a more cinematic, OST oriented rock band. Same line up as before: guitar + lead voice, drummer, bass player and me, the later two doing second vocals. The sound lies between ambiances of old spy movies and western movies. My set up is the same as before too: NE4D and Little Phatty. The LP produces great leads and allows me to use an old radio microphone through its filter and overload section. The NE delivers mostly acoustic pianos and Eps, some rare organs and clavinet… as well as a couple of Mellotron sounds. Hey, what did you expect? : )At home, the NE is may main work board… but I don”t work much haha! The LP is often connected to some MoogerFoogers for (semi-) modular madness, which is what I spend most of my time to these days when playing at home.For those wanting to listen to all that, please find links in my signature or make a search on any music streaming platform for DNOT, Toxic Overdrive.

In the past I've owned an Electro 3HP, Electro 3-73SW and Electro 2-61.I participate in several groups, but it all mostly centers a set of core people. I play piano in two traditional jazz big bands. One is a community band whose membership is of rather mixed talent. We rehearse nearly weekly, and play out about 5-6 times per year. The MD is a trumpet player friend of mine.The other big band is managed by a sax player friend. This band meets about once a month, and gigs only a couple of times per year. It's a killer lineup of many pros, session players and music educators. The players change based on availability, but everyone is super talented. I almost don't deserve to be part of that band.I'm also part of a jazz fusion band run by the same sax player. Other members are a guitarist, bassist and drummer who all sit in or regularly play with one of the above bands. We play stuff from Mike Stern, Weather Report, Paquito de Rivera and Robben Ford. It's a really different experience for me, and a lot of fun. We do about 4-5 gigs each year.I just started a cocktail duo with the trumpet player from the first band. It's a simple little thing, but it actually pays a little money.Finally, we do small gigs as a jazz combo. We can interchange among people, but it includes the sax player, guitarist and me. We use the same pool of people for drums, bass, additional horns (including the trumpet player), etc. Most of us are in the same age range and do this for fun more than anything.For all of this stuff, the Stage is my main axe. I use it by itself 99% of the time. A lot of it has to do with practicality. Most of my rehearsals and gigs are two hours or less, so it's not worth the effort to haul out a second keyboard, mixer, cables, etc. I play piano for almost all of the songs, so it's not worth the time and trouble to bring out the Electro just to play once or twice. I get by just fine on the Stage.I will sometimes bring out the Electro by itself for the small pickup gigs. I like the light weight, and it gives me an excuse to play more organ. But I prefer the weighted action and more keys on the Stage for bigger gigs. In either case, I tend to not use a mixer when playing a single keyboard. I usually plug the two stereo outputs into the A and B inputs on the QSC.I will occasionally haul out both instruments. If we're doing longer sessions or jams, when it's worth the effort to set up. And it sounds killer!I own a pair of QSC K8.2's and an older K10. In most of the big band situations, I bring only a single 8.2. It provides plenty of sound and is easy to carry - I can carry my whole rig in a single trip! If we're playing outside, I'll add one of the other speakers. For the fusion band, I use both 8's for myself and add the K10 to the one the sax player owns to make a complete band PA or for monitors. I mix my stuff with a Mackie ProDX 8, which is a great little digital mixer. A few months ago, I added a Minifooger MF Drive pedal to my fusion rig. I send the lead synth sounds out of the Stage's Output 3 and into the Drive. The pedal has a creamy Moog filter in it, and adding just a touch of drive gives the Stage lead patches a nice rich presence.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=98794&sid=f802187e18465db6598dcffa8af10379#p98794

I knew that the father of one of my son's friends played guitar, and I asked him if he wanted to get together an play a bit. We started by just jamming to standards in my basement. At the same time, my wife found out that a local adult school had a traditional big band group that was organized through a local community organization, and he encouraged me to get involved.So, a lot of this is her fault.After getting comfortable with the band, I asked the bass player and drummer if they would be interested in joining the guitar player and me for occasional Friday night jazz jams in my basement. We did that for quite a while until the drummer moved away. The original guitar player from the big band moved on, and I asked my friend to join. It was really great; we had a nice rhythm section that played well together, and it showed.During that time, the lead trumpet player took a liking to me and asked if I would be interested in sitting in with another big band run by a long time sax player friend of his. I agreed, and the sax guy started calling me on a regular basis to play with that band. I got to develop a pretty good relationship with the sax guy, and was introduced to another bass player and two more drummers.Up to this point, I considered myself a decent, but not great, jazz pianist. I could read and could improvise enough to get away with it. But, I'm a pretty low maintenance guy and I do my homework. I borrowed the piano charts to copy/scan and practice. I always came prepared. Sax Man is big on loyalty, as in he is very loyal to others, so I tend to be his first call.Now there are other available pianists in the area, many of them more talented than me. Not all of them read, though, some are undependable and many are working people who want money for rehearsals. I play to have fun and get better. The money is secondary. I think they keep calling me because they know I'll show up (be careful what you ask for)!So, at this point, we're kind of a core crowd of 1 keyboard player, 1 guitarist, 2 basses, 3 drummers, a sax and a trumpet. There are a few other horn players that we call on occasion. We do gigs in various sizes - duos, trios, quartets, etc. The fusion band is formed out of this group, but we don't interchange members.We are all pretty much in the same age range and have the same mindset about playing. Some are better players than others, but none of us are world class by any stretch. We get together to have fun, learn a bit and put some collective energy into this passion of ours.I'll end with a joke:A Jazz Musician wins a million dollars in the lottery. He's being interviewed by the local TV station, and he's asked by the reporter ""What will you do now that you've won the lottery?""His response: ""I don't know. I guess I'll just keep playing until the money runs out.""I'm here all week. Try the veal.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=99003&sid=f802187e18465db6598dcffa8af10379#p99003

All that in a 6 kg, 60+cm package. That' heavy, in the Marty McFly's way of saying itThe Organelle has less in all those aspects, but it fits any handbag. That's a very goos point too if this interface is enough for you.The G2 has a proprietary editor, not maintained anymore but with few enough bugs to be used for 98% of what the comunity can imagine. The Organelle takes advantage of PureData: huge community, possibilities even wicer than the G2's... at the price of having to learn the language, as bricks are thinner.All in all, I would say the Organelle is a very attractive package for what it proposes at the price is proposes it.

No virtuosity (rock between grunge to filmscore-ish going through energic electronics), but some coordination issues sometimes.I’m the founder of one of them so the difficulty of learning the songs is up to my mate and I: the more difficult the longer to make it good. In this one, I have to program a MachineDrum (I owe you some links), a Moog synth for bass parts and a Clavia G2. For the later, I don’t patch anymore, I rather use a handful of patches I’ve been enhancing through years (architectures of NordLead, Juno 6, RS-09 for instance). We rehearse once a week; sometimes it’s just for maintaining the existing songs, sometimes hard composition work. Being only two means songs have to be arranged so that they sound cool with only two voices, four hands and four feet (pedal boards inside…). That’s a couple of hours a week.The second band is one I joined. So I had to learn the songs, then rearrange them for my gear and we are now composing music in band. What has been a real benefit for fixing interpretation is a “residence” we had last year. I’m not sure how to say it in English, but it consists in renting a venue and play, re-play etc the set with some professional throwing us criticism and advice. Very nice experience. The ambitions of this bands are quite high even if not professional: half of us as pro musicians, but the other half does not want to give up on their jobs to do this full time. Now that we have approximately one hour of material, we rehearse more or less we needed, that is before gigs and once in a while. Demoing at home is another activity we sometimes have, and recording sessions are in the pipe. All in all, that’s 3 hours a week when a rehearsal occurs.The third band I play in is my teenage band; been playing together ten years, been off ten more years, and back to business for two years now. This is the easiest part: we totally understand each other in one look, there is a main author composer and we play arrange songs. Sometimes another one brings something, and we always end setting a the 80-90% of a new song in two-three 30 minutes sessions. The remains percentage is done along the sessions, things have to get mature.This represents 3 hours a week when rehearsal occur.Besides, I play at home to maintain that, to find my sounds, parts, settings. Not on a regular basis, maybe 2 hours a week in average.And finally, I happen to wander between synths and pedals, pretending to search my settings for bandsSo basically, when none band rehearse, I play a couple of hours during the week end. And heaviest weeks have me playing 7-8 hours out of the office hours.What I’d like to do:Work a bit more of basic technic: left hand, simple jazz piano exercises,… Learn piano tracks as I used to do at one point.Learn bass for funk in particular. Resume making my own FX pedals too… Compose and record my own songs – that happens once in a while, actually.Voilà",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=91578&sid=f802187e18465db6598dcffa8af10379#p91578

I have a full-time job. I do have the luxury of working from home, so I spend about the first 90 minutes of my day practicing.I play in two traditional big bands, occasionally sit in with a third, have a jazz fusion band and play small combo stuff with various other musicians. I went back to taking lessons about a year ago after more than 30 years, and have gotten serious about my practice regime.- Scales: majors, various minors, diminished, altered in various meters (to play better solos)- Diatonic motion practice: only major modes right now, but in various meters and styles (improve soloing skills)- Classical pieces: I'm currently working on Bach Inventions #4, #6, #8 and Clair de Lune (to develop touch, timing and better regimented playing)- Improvisation: Usually done with iRealPro over standard jazz tunes or ii-V-I variations- Transcribing: The is a first for me. I'm currently transcribing a recording of A Sleeping' Bee done by Ellis Marsalis- Popular songs: currently working on Maple Lead Rag and Linus and Lucy- Working on specific band tunes as required. I'll always practice our standard fusion book the few days leading up to a gig (which are not that often)I don't do all of these at every sitting, but do try to tackle the respective development objectives of each. It's never been easy for me to perfectly emulate playing a song; I've always improvised, so learning how play something exact is a significant challenge.Big band is mostly reading, so I get my reading practice there. I also get a solid 2-3 hour block of time a few times a month on a weekend or evening, which helps me bang stuff out.I spend a whole lot more time practicing than I do tinkering with instruments. I will do some programming on the Stage to prepare for a new fusion tune, as well as some tweaking of sounds when I hear something on a gig I don't like. But I'm much more focused on improving as a player right now.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=91579&sid=f802187e18465db6598dcffa8af10379#p91579

The FA has the older (non-SuperNatural, but still good) strings from the XV-5080 and (downloadable) SRX cards, the Jupiters do not. (The Integra7 has all these things.)

Moog discontinued their Analog Delag pedal which  cost $700 originally and now those are going for over $1000.But here's the thing. I could order a MFB Dominion 1 for 1300 (500 less) and turn around and sell it for a couple hundred more I'm almost positive... But the Subdequent 37 looks awesome and they have increased the headroom for the filter (whatever that means) apparently you get lots of gain without distortion.So do you think it would be a good investment to buy on me manufactured at Moog Fest and then try to sell if for a prophet? Or do you think they will release another Subsequent 37 type machine.

In the world of guitars for example, you have guitars and bass guitars. They are similar but they are distinctly different instruments, and typically dedicated musicians primarily gravitate to, and master, only one. In the world of synthesizers we tend to focus on synthesis methods like analog, PCM, FM, wavetable, granular, additive and so on. We focus on timbre and we take treble and bass for granted - they are just the different ranges of tones we play on our synths ...""I just would like to say a few words  about it. IMHO, of course.I  have the incredible STUDIO ELECTRONICS SE-1X analogue synth. It's an expensive instrument. It could really compare with the Minitaur in the Low End range, it  sounds very powerful as a bass synth with its 3 VCO, but it doesn't have  a note range limitations. It  produces the LEAD sounds without any problem. It can be compare with the MOOG RME for its possibilities, but I think it sounds  fatter and more powerful in the Low End that the MOOG RME.

Also, I would like to incorporate my set list maker app as well.So far the biggest problem has been playing the nlog from the cp50......I'm using the irig interface as such.......cp50 midi out to irig midi in......irig midi out to cp50 midi in and cp 50 thru to electro midi in.My thought is the cp50 could control the nord and nlog. The patchbay could send program changes to the cp50 then from the cp 50 midi thru to the nord, and internally to the nlog.The nord seems to function fine in this manner but the nlog does not.....do I have it set up correctly? For instance what should the device be set to on the NLOG external 2 ""channel"" ?The other thing I'd like to know is, will the patchbay respond to program changes from the  SETLIST MAKER app? I'd like to call up a song on SETLIST maker and have it send changes to the patchbay and then to the keyboards (and synth app).

Or is there another way?In this configuration the program changes won't send from the Electro to the Lead.My other issue is when I change the MIDI Global on the Lead back to 16 then the program changes work fine as in Scenario B but then I am hearing BOTH sounds of BOTH units on each keyboard.Thanks to anyone in advance who may be able to help me out, I imagine to someone who knows their stuff it may be a simple answer.My setup is:I have 2 MIDI DIN cables from the MIDI IN of each unit to the MIDI OUT of the other.On the Electro I have MIDI set as follows -Local Control Mode: ONChannel Global: 16Channel Lower Receive: OFFChannel Upper Receive: OFFChannel Upper Split: 2Control Change Mode: SEND/RECEIVEProgram Change Mode: SENDTranspose MIDI at: MIDI INOn the Nord Lead I have set as follows -Channel Global: 2A, B, C, D Slot Channels: All set to OFFSoft Thru Channel: OFFMIDI Interface: PU (PIN & USB)Local Control Mode: OnControl Change Mode: OFFControl Change Mode: SEND & RECEIVEProgram Change Mode: RECEIVEPitch bend Mode: SEND & RECEIVE",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=80772&sid=f802187e18465db6598dcffa8af10379#p80772

172735,6,f802187e18465db6598dcffa8af10379,p7146,Korg NANOKontrol 2 Review,2,Johannes,2011-09-12T12:19:27+00:00,False,,"Before getting to the Nords, I used to record basic song ideas on the workstation/stage piano I was playing using the standard Sounds plus the integrated sequencer.Since the Nords don't feature a sequencer, I relied on hardware ones for the last years, namely the MPC 500 and a QY 70. But I sold both since I never really got the immediacy and direct control to record on the fly some nice tunes with basic bass, drums and multiple keys parts.Then I started working with Ableton LE and while it is a great piece of software, I hated to have to fall back to the touchpad/mouse for simple operations.Finally, I found that a controller that has been discussed recently in some topics about cheap drawbar controllers or sample playback controllers, namely the Korg NanoKontrol 2 and after getting it, I now really feel to have the perfect companion for my Nord Stage with lots of controller elements (as the Nords) but using for record and playback etc. For as little as 60 Dollars (http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/ ... n2bk&SID=0) it is really a great deal me thinks!So I though I'd write a small review of the NANOKontrol 2 (in particular comparing it with its precedessor):nanokontrol2-black.jpg (19.1 KiB) Viewed 17485 timesOverall Impression:Very sturdy built, the knows don't hang (as it was the case with the previous version), layout is nice and the pots and faders seem pretty solid. Really like the device to touch and play with it. Installing and setup with the Korg Software is piece of cake (Win7 x64).Workflow :First, setting it to work, e.g., controlling the drawbars of your Nord is easily done with the Korg Editor and e.g., MIDI OX, but the main advantages is using it with your DAW software.After trying first the CC mode setting up with Live (the DAW I am using but should be similar with any DAW supporting MIDI control), I realized that this Mode while being very flexible ist not optimal with the Transport and Track Mute/Record/Arm buttons. I experienced that sometimes button presses did not get registered. Moreover, the lights were not always aligned with the respective setings in Live. While it mostly worked, I felt that the MIDI implementation with DAW Transport control is not a perfect match. It surely works for basic stuff, but having to arm with one or two presses is annoying, in particular since you loose accuracy of the lights. The NK2 also receives the settings from the DAW, i.e., if I arm or mute a track using the mouse, the according lights on the NK2 will change accordingly (this wasnt possible on the NK1).This is when I thought I will try the DAW specific modes integrated in the NK2, which was not available on the NK1. So I selected the Live-Mode in the Korg Editor and wrote it to the NK2's memory and voila:Now transport control and mixing, arming, muting etc. worked like charm: When you press play, count in starts, once playback begins the play button lights up, all Lights are always in Sync with Live, the selected track is always highlighted and selected when turning a fader etc. Excellent and I don't have to touch the computer while making music!!I have to admit, Mackie User Control as implemented in the NK2 is really a big step forward from standard Midi CC control!!! (If you see some videos on youtube of the original NK1, there were complaints that the lights were not always in sync with the settings in your DAW, track arming etc., this is now much better.)Then I wanted to still do some customizing of e.g., the Pan knobs and the Sole buttons since I hardly use them. Using Live's MIDI Mapping, I assigned launch the current scene to all respective Solo buttons and the Pan Knobs to the Cutoff frequency of a Filter I added to all tracks.Result? As one would hope for, the standard assignment is overwritten and now the buttons and knobs do what I wanted while all the other elements work as before. Bottom line, using the preprogrammed MCU controls still allows to customize some settings to taste and thereby you get a perfect combination of both.Also, when it comes to the MIDI channels where you use the NORD's internal sounds, I changed the assignment of the Fader (which would not do anything on MIDI tracks): Adding a MIDI Compressor into the signal chain set to ompletely linear and assigning the MAX value to the fader, I can control the sound of the Nord Stage when played back by the Fader!You can evem control the whole set of Mackie User Controls (see here for a full list:http://web.archive.org/web/200801260936 ... /MCMap.htmfor instance, Undo or Redo!) by changing the assignment of the keys (OK this is more a hack since it requires adjusting your DAW's internal MIDI wiring but it is fairly easy (at least in Ableton):  You just need to edit the decimal value of the key Note On Message sent from the respective button on your NK2 to map in the file consts.py and put the changed version in the folder in Midi Remote Scripts/Mackie Control_Classic.The uncompiled files can be found here:http://www.assembla.com/spaces/live-api/documents. Once you put the phyton file in your installation's directory, it automatically gets compiled when you start Live and you're done! I have no undo(SID_FUNC_UNDO) and Arrangement/Session Switch(SID_AUTOMATION_ON) on the bank back(46) /forward(47) buttons, very convenient when recordingDrawbacks:1) The missing master faderNow since they cut off one fader, you don't have the classical 8 channels+Master configuration anymore.So what I did, is I assigned in MIDI mapping of my DAW the 8th channel Fader to master control, the Pan know to the metronome volume and the three buttons to some other overal settings.This way, I can use the seven channels as normal and have the eigths one for Master.2) No more 4 Scenes available (compared to the v1)True, the scenes are gone! What kind of replaced them are the Bank settings. You can switch (only in the MCU DAW specific modes) between banks of channels of (usually . This way, you can control 8 channels, hit Bank Forward and access Ch9-16, etc. And the best part, as describe before, if you switch between bank, mute arm or solo tracks and switch to another bank, the lights always are in sync with the bank you are currently editing!!The only problem is that that works only with the settings you don't customize. That is, if you (like me) assign Ch8 as a master fader/channel, you cannot control channel 8 at all!Another issue with the disappeared scenes it that there are less elements (knobs, buttons, faders) to setup as controllers, which is true. However, you get another 8 buttons (SOLO) which you can assign, plus the three buttons of Marker Set/Back/Forward, which I very much like in the standard configuration, plus the two bank select buttons which cou can also assign if you don't need the bank functionality. Those 8+5 additional buttons are directly available without changing scenes. But I admit, you still have less overall assignable elements than on the previous version.One more thing about the MUC DAW modes: Basically, all elements send CCs or Notes ON messages, and I did not manage to change the MIDI channel from the Standard one (=1) in the Korg Editor, so I needed to set all my midi channels to not receive on Ch1 since otherwise they would record some notes from the NANOKontrol without NoteOff (=pretty annoying) when you customize some MIDI commands.Verdict:The NANOKontrol 2 is an upgrade in several respects to the NK1. In particular the Mackie User Control Modes for the most widely used DAWs are a huge upgrade since Transport and Track Control is much more precise and in sync! In particular for mixing purposes this enhances the functionality dramatically! For Live DJing, the left out 4 scenes and also the dropped envelopes for the buttons might make the NK1 still a better choice though.In general, the added 13 buttons are nice, but you loose the four complete scenes of controls.The improved build quality is a significant change from what I saw on various reviews and videos. I never managed to get a button stick like in particular on the old transport field.The left out 9th fader is the biggest loss over the previous edition IMHO both as a Live Control device and Mixing console, and also if you think of using it as a Drawbar controller.Overall, me personally I definitively prefer it over what I have seen from the previous version, in particular due to the Mackie User Control which gives you much more precision and immediacy controlling your DAW, plus the improved build quality, but the missing 9th fader makes it a 9*/10* product.Usually I don't like to review/praise a piece of gear too much, but I was really flattered with the additional freedom and immediacy this little inexpensive tool added to my workflow that I had to write this little review (and since there are not many out there so far of the v2). Feel free if you have any questions about this nice little toy!JohannesI also considered the Behringer BCF-2000 which has an additional foot input, MIDI IN and OUT, Motorfader, but is larger and needs a power supply. Since I wouldnt have much use for motorized faders and needed more buttons, the Korg was what I finally went with, also at a third the price.UPDATE: In Ableton Live 9, the files have ben slightly changed so I uploaded both python files for Live 8 & 9. Just rename it to consts.py and put it in the ""MackieControl"" folder of MIDI Remote Scripts of your Live Installation, rename consts.pyc to consts_backup.pyc and restart Live which comèiles the script at first use.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=7146&sid=f802187e18465db6598dcffa8af10379#p7146

It may not be relevant for most readers, but anyway here goes:I develop my own MIDI software, until recently I only used native MIDI via adaptors, but I’m moving to MIDI over USB. The chat groups are full of posts about problems with MoUSB, particularly when a USB hub is involved, and I encountered one as well. Sometimes I have to send a string of messages to a single device, including Sysex/es, an example is:Sysex to change the mode of a sound generatorBank change / program changeSysex to set a parameter in a sound generator part.What I found was that some of these message bundles behaved strangely. Sometimes some actions were completely ignored, or actions produced incorrect results. When I switched back to straight MIDI, the problems disappeared.The nice thing about MIDI is that it’s easy to view the actual packets using a package such as MidiOx. It’s harder with USB, you need specialised software that I don’t have the energy to find, install and learn (although I probably have to make the effort).  Anyway, the only easy thing I could think of doing was to add small delays between the message sends using the Win32 Sleep function, so the above example would become:Sysex to change the mode of a sound generatorSleep (20)    // 20millisecond delayBank change / program changeSleep (20)    // 20millisecond delaySysex to set a parameter in a sound generator part.In my case I can do this without latency problems, because there is always a reasonable time between these message bundles, and a delay of a few 10s of milliseconds is of no consequence. They are only used for patch changes and similar events.Anyway, it worked, the resultant program seems as solid as the native MIDI equivalent. Given the timing around USB, I expect that the Sleep times could probably be reduced significantly.In the several weeks I’ve been working with USB, this bundled message problem is the only one I’ve come across. The critical real time stuff, ND, NUs and streams of pitch bend messages & the like, seem to work without fail.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=80212&sid=f802187e18465db6598dcffa8af10379#p80212

Perhaps fewer people understand how completely immersed he was in a musical world of his own creation, even when there was no keyboard instrument at hand.  Some few years ago Bernie was spotted at a popular area restaurant one evening in Anaheim after a long day at the NAMM show.  Anonymously seated alone at the end of bar while surrounded by a hectic cacophony of other NAMM attendees who were completely oblivious to his presence, there was Bernie, furiously fingering basslines on the bartop for half an hour while waiting for his food to arrive.  The man literally lived and breathed music every moment of his life and his inspiration and example will be greatly missed by the music world at large.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=74175&sid=bf14f347043cc34e3a45c5a9ff649377#p74175

Edit your kit to add it the MIDI machine with the number of the channel you want to use (independently of the Base channel setting), and go ahead.BTW you can set no Base channel so that only the MIDI machines send MIDI data (again refer to the MD manual).Obviously, have your NR2 set on the right MIDI channel, i.e. the one of the MIDI machine you use.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=73716&sid=bf14f347043cc34e3a45c5a9ff649377#p73716

I'm sure they will, eventually, but I assume it's pretty far down on their priority list at this point, so we'll probably be waiting quite a few years for that.For live use, I use Set List Maker from Arlomedia all the time. I keep my repertoire of music and lead sheets sorted by project (some 300 songs), and have PDF lead sheets or chords as text attached to most of them.

It's a scale you play on any chords with a #9 or b9. It comes from the rules of improvisation with modes.Thus, in A (I take A because it's the relative minor of C, and all the dominant diminished, diminished dominant, melodic Minor and so in, are the second part when you learn mode in basic jazz courses on improvisation....) is Half step, then whole step, then half step etc....So, A, Bb, C, Db, Eb, E, Gb, G and ATo be more precise, on a Am7, a IIm7, you would have played Dorien which is the major scale one step below the chord, so, G major.p, G, A, B, C, D,E, F#, GBut on an Am7b9, you play dominant diminished.....the one that I described above.If it would have been a Diminished chord, which is a minor chord where the 5th and the 7th are diminished, play diminished dominant, Called also whole half step..so on a chord which is .A, C,Eb, Gb (noted Adim or A0) you play A, B, C, D, Eb, F, Gb and A again....If it's a semi dinimished chord, which is in fact just the 5th that is diminished (A, C#, Eb, G), or also any 7th chord with a b5th, just play Locrien.Finally, yes, your example is tasty, because usually, on an altered chord, which is a chord with a #5 AND a #9, you usually play melodic minor half step above the chord.That's itDon't worry, this is just a start to help you find the right scale to improvise but after some time you will hear in your head what notes are correct to play in any mode....and back sometime to rules when you hesitate... miles Davis, blues in green or Bill Evans Sometme ago or both of them playing Someday my prince will come, or blue Bossa ( when you are fade up of the blues scales....) are good example of songs where you can use the scale above.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=69603&sid=bf14f347043cc34e3a45c5a9ff649377#p69603

I haven't looked inside a Stage, but the rubber strips are usually in segments, so you don't have to remove the whole keyboard if only one note is affected.For one thing, the actual key contacts are located beneath the rubber strips, with each note's contacts isolated from all the others.  Yes, it's true that crud can rattle around, but it's not likely to rattle it's way into the domed area enclosing key contacts.  This occurs during playing.  When a key is pressed, the dome is flattened and air is expelled.  When the key is subsequently released, the dome springs back into shape, resulting in air being sucked into that cavity.  Any crud in the immediate vicinity can and sometimes will be sucked in along with it.For another thing, on HA and SW models, the contact PCBs are mounted to the underside of the keybed, so the entire keybed does have to be removed in order to gain access to the individual key contacts.  On the HP and synth actions, the contact PCBs are mounted directly beneath the keys but above the frame, so it is true that only a certain number of keys may need to be removed to access the contact areas, but the clearance to the front of the lower chassis is so tight that it is necessary to remove the entire keybed assembly first to gain the needed clearance to remove single keys.Here's a pic of a nasty old synth action showing the ventilation channels through which dirt must pass in order to foul contacts.Bless,Pablokeybed03 captioned.jpg (1.89 MiB) Viewed 1210 times",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=71344&sid=bf14f347043cc34e3a45c5a9ff649377#p71344

Same goes for the MS20 MINI and the original Mopho, both are mono and cheap.Of course these are far less capable than the Pro 2, but my point is that analog polyphony is expensive. The Mono Mopho module is $399; the 4-voice polyphonic version of that minimal synth, the Tetra, is already more than double the price, $849. Each additional note of analog polyphony essentially requires building in the componentry of, well, practically another synthesizer. So any given monophonic analog design gets more expensive to make as you add polyphony.Gustavo wrote:The way I see this new Pro 2 is like a super luxurious mono synth.Yup, that's exactly what it is!

You pretty much just need to have the ensemble effect in your keyboard or you won't ever get a convincing string machine sound (assuming that you're looking for a fairly accurate reproduction).Although I haven't actually tried it out, I would bet that the A1 would be a much better synth for producing old string machine sounds than the Lead 2 or Prophet 08 (for example) for that reason. So yes, the Streichfett is a very good idea if you want that sound, it's got the right stuff for the job.As you said, at that price, it's an easy decision, and there's nothing else out there doing the same job.

The CP4 is lacking an Upright piano and the Nord is lacking a good Keyboard. I was thinking of a merge, a layering if you will. Having the Yamaha Grand piano Sound and layer the upright Sound over it. If this doesn't work, well, than just Play the upright Sound from the Nord Electro  on the CP4 via MIDI. Something like this.

I've tried using channel 10 in both the general MIDI-settings and in the extern settings, but it doesen't seem to affect anything.2) Is it possible to start and stop the iElectribe from NS2? According to the aforementioned page, CC 7 should control start/stop, so I guess this should be possible. But what do I use as trigger? A key?3) How do i make the masterclocks sync?

These two engines can be freely zoned or layered across eight parts in a single MONTAGE Performance.Interact with MONTAGE Performances using Motion Control: a highly programmable control matrix for creating deep, dynamic and incredibly expressive sound. With Motion Control, you can create new sounds not possible on previous hardware synthesizers.1. Sophisticated Dynamic ControlMusic is expression. MONTAGE adds a new level of expression with the Motion Control Synthesis Engine. This engine allows a variety of methods to interact with and channel your creativity into finding your own unique sound.- Super KnobCreate dynamic sound changes from radical to sublime with the Super Knob. The Super Knob can control multiple parameters simultaneously resulting in anything you can imagine.For example: change your listening position from right in front of an instrument to in the back seat of a concert hall. Or radically change the character of a Performance from atmospheric and mellow to rhythmic and edgy.The Super Knob can even be assigned to a second FC7 foot controller making it easy to manipulate the sound when playing with both hands.- Motion SEQMotion Sequences are tempo-synchronized, completely customizable control sequences that can be assigned to virtually any synthesizer parameter and provide incredible creative new ways of programming sound.Motion Sequences also have dedicated controls on the front panel making it easy to manipulate and change in real-time, providing incredible interactivity and expression.- Envelope FollowerEnlargeThe Envelope Follower converts audio into a control source for control of virtually any synthesizer parameter. For example, a drum loop could drive effects parameters for a cool rhythms or a vocal recording could control multiple parameters for a “talking” synthesizer. The audio can even be a “live” source through the A/D input.2. Massive Sound CreationMONTAGE features two Iconic Sound Engines modernized for amazing sound playback and complex sound design.- AWM2Powered by proprietary Yamaha technology for data compression and sound playback, AWM2 allows tremendous data compression without sound quality loss for unparalleled, realistic sound reproduction.128-Note, Stereo polyphonyExperience rich stereo sound without halving the available number of notes.Waveform CapacityMONTAGE features nearly 10 times the waveform capacity of the MOTIF XF, allowing more samples per instrument for incredibly realistic and nuanced sound.Integrated Flash MemoryMONTAGE includes 1.75 GB of user flash memory with high speed reading/writing for your own custom samples or synth libraries from yamahasynth.com.- FM-XAn amazingly sophisticated pure synthesizer engine capable of producing classic ‘80s or cutting-edge EDM sound with incredible dynamic range, power and fidelity. MONTAGE features an 8-operator FM architecture and 128-note polyphony, allowing for a massive array of sound design options.- ContentEvery instrument needs great content to inspire your creativity. MONTAGE features a huge range of incredible sounds like a brand-new Yamaha CFX Premium Grand Piano, detailed new strings and woodwinds and select content from the DX and TX family, all modernized to take advantage of the Motion Control Synthesis Engine.CompatibilityMONTAGE is directly compatible with Motif XF Voices. Yamaha is developing an FM converter to make it compatible with DX7 series Voices as well.Bösendorfer PianoAs part of the MONTAGE introduction, Yamaha is pleased to offer an incredible Bösendorfer Imperial Premium Grand Piano.- EffectsFrom high definition reverbs to incredibly detailed Virtual Circuit Modeling (VCM) effects, MONTAGE is loaded with DSP innovation, power and, most importantly, sound quality. Use effects like Beat Repeat, Vinyl Break or Bit Crusher to get a modern EDM sound. You can even add a compressor with sidechain for a modern “ducking” effect. Or go retro with vintage effects like Analog Delay, VCM Phaser or a variety of Amp Simulators. Piano players will appreciate piano-focused effects like Damper Resonance for a super-realistic piano experience and the HD reverbs that let you put yourself in any performance space.- Pure Analog CircuitMONTAGE features professional balanced outputs with “Pure Analog Circuit” (PAC). PAC improves the quality of signal after being converted to analog from digital for clear harmonic reproduction and even frequency response. The result is an output capable of reproducing MONTAGE’s internal content expressively with power and clarity.3. Streamlined WorkflowHow do you want to integrate your instrument with your system? How do you want to organize the onboard content? How do you want to interact with the instrument while you play? MONTAGE answers these questions and more with a flexible, streamlined workflow.- USB Audio/MIDI ConnectionConnect MONTAGE to your computer with a single USB cable and capture every nuance of your creativity into your DAW. MONTAGE’s powerful USB driver can send 16 and receive 3 channels of STEREO 24 bit/44.1 kHz digital audio to/from your computer or iOS device (MONTAGE is class compliant, no driver needed!), no other hardware required!The USB connection also features full MIDI support of 16 channels.* MONTAGE supports the sampling rate up to 192 kHz.- SSS (Seamless Sound Switching)Seamless Sound Switching (SSS) lets you change performances seamlessly without any cut-off in envelope or effects. This is perfect for live performances where you end one song and start another without stopping.* This function is only available for Performances that have a maximum of 8 parts.- A/D InputThe A/D input processes external audio sources with your instrument’s DSP. Use mics, guitars or any line source as an input and process with the internal effects.You can even use these sources with the Envelope Follower or Sidechain for a truly unique sound.- Physical ControlEight Rotary Encoders and Faders with Stepladder LEDMONTAGE features a comprehensive set of physical controls for intuitive music making and sound creation.Touch ScreenSelect and change parameters directly with the new color touch screen.Eight Rotary Encoders and Faders with Stepladder LEDStepladder LEDs next to the faders indicate position making it easy to see where your current mix position is.Keyboard ActionMONTAGE is available in three different configurations:MONTAGE6 and 7 feature the premium FSX semi-weighted synthesizer action with aftertouch in 61 and 76 keys respectively.MONTAGE8 features an 88 key, fully-weighted Balanced Hammer action with aftertouch. This provides equal resistance for each key across the keyboard and is perfect for playing a variety of instruments from acoustic piano to electric piano, synth sounds, organ and more!- LIVE SETLive Set lets you organize your Performances however you want without copying, changing order or renaming. When a Performance is selected, you can easily register it to a Live Set. This is perfect for playing gigs or even creating your own organization scheme for Performances.- Direct Control AssignmentDirect Control Assignment assigns controls at the touch of a button. Simply select a parameter, hit the Direct Control Assignment button and move the controller to control that parameter. It’s easy!- Cubase AI bundleMONTAGE is bundled with Cubase AI, Steinberg's professional music production application that offers integrated recording and editing.Unfortunately it has no minikeys.

I don't know why synth manufacturers are so infatuated with 25-keys when a 32 or 37 offers much more playability AND more room to lay out controls (eg knob-per-function rather than doubling them up).Well, production cost is the main reason for sure. Hardware is expensive, and the keybed in particular is the biggest and most expensive component of any keyboard. Any company surely prefers to keep things as small as possible, to keep production costs down and margins up.And for sure customers like cheap and small keyboards: they fit in a backpack or laptop bag, weigh next to nothing, don't take up precious space in the studio and, most of all... allow us to buy multiple boards for the fraction of the price of a workstation!It's the cheapest way to quench GAS!Jokes apart, it's clear that there's some truth in that, just look at the recent flood of minisynths from all brands.I also don't find 2 octaves THAT limiting in a mono synth. Two octaves is about the natural extension of a human voice, that's the reference for any solo sound. So it's the most pleasant-sounding range you are likely to use in a solo.Moreover, you will be using only one hand on the keyboard, and by definition you won't be doing chords or accompaniment, so you will have your left hand free all of the time. 99% of synths have the octave shift button and the pitch bend wheel, that allow you to extend your playing range in real time with your free hand.All in all, in a mono synth I really don't miss more real estate, for me it's not worth the extra money, weight and size.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=67536&sid=bf14f347043cc34e3a45c5a9ff649377#p67536

Different sonic options and different nuances, of course, but both are really good instruments.Neither of them comes close to the Moog sound, however (I advise you on this as you are also looking at a Slim or Little Phatty).The BSII is way more powerful, more features, full size keys, etc. And of course, having patch memories is a HUGE plus.But don't underestimate the Microbrute. It looks like a toy but it's very, VERY serious stuff. The single oscillator and filter are not so limited as they look (there are some clever tricks and workarounds), the sequencer is actually better than that on the BSII, and the patch matrix is SO much fun.Not having patch memory is clearly a limitation, but it also forces you to really LEARN how to make sounds.Want that kind of sound you liked so much? You don't just scroll the preset, you have to re-build the sound wave by wave, envelope by envelope.It looks like a drag (and it is, sometimes), but it's also unbelievably didactic.Seriously, the Micro has been the most instructive and fun musical tool I encountered since I first laid my hands on a piano.

Two octaves is about the natural extension of a human voice, that's the reference for any solo sound. So it's the most pleasant-sounding range you are likely to use in a solo.You make a valid point regarding the range thing. The advantage a 37-key board has is that it covers a 2-octave range in every single key (playing in G could require lots of octave shift since you'd be missing a fifth at the top end) and there are some solos that use a wide range to great effect, building the intensity of the solo - a great example would be Cory Henry's solo on Lingus. He uses almost the whole range of a King Korg.Two octaves wouldn't be the end of the world and I can really understand the benefits in terms of portability, but to me it feels like it would be a bit cramped.

What you guys think?To be honest, I don't think we could advise one over the other without more knowledge of exactly what you need.Which one do you like the sound of better? Do they both have the sounds and features you need?They're both top of the range pro instruments. Unless there's something very specific you need that one of them can't actually do, I would imagine that sound-wise they're both more than good enough for almost anything.The Motif is far more of an all-rounder in terms of what it can do beyond basically being a keyboard. It's an extremely fully-fledged workstation, complete with sequencer, arpeggiators, sampling capabilities, DAW integration, sound expansion, and probably a hot-dog stand as well.  I believe its sound capabilities are exclusively sample-based.The Jupiter 80 is more of a pure player's keyboard than a workstation. Arpeggiator, but no sequencer. It does have a fairly powerful VA synth section (which the Motif doesn't have) as well as being a sample-based keyboard.Be warned, they are both extremely large and heavy. How large?

You can use an external audio and change it with the Bass Station Filter section... very funny!In short: I thought of buying a ""toy"" just for the bass lines and instead I find myself with a new keyboard that I do not think I will leave home easily.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=63391&sid=bf14f347043cc34e3a45c5a9ff649377#p63391

Too much hassle, and nothing you can't do with existing keyboards.At the quoted price you're not going to buy them casually and sling them in your backpack for school or college, and ""collecting the set"" will be prohibitively expensive. $3000 plus for four?

Stuff that guys in suits may not have allowed to get further than the design bench otherwise.I wouldn't hold your breath. If the market's not there, new serious keyboards won't be produced. And as far as I can figure out, the Refaces are using old repackaged technology, so if they are successful (and I'm pretty sure they will be despite my reservations), there doesn't seem to be anything new to come from them that could power a new generation of more advanced products.On a separate note, I had a rather gloomy premonition. I am wondering if the current existing generation of high-end workstation keyboards are the end of the line. Roland and Yamaha have done nothing but update their existing Motif and Fantom range for years now, and I'm guessing that they might not see any point in trying to rival or beat the Kronos. And for Korg, where next after the Kronos? This keyboard has years to run yet, and I suspect that by the time it is completely outdated, things will have changed so much that workstations may be completely irrelevant in the market.

That paradigm is already here and will be far more widely adopted once more people get comfortable with the idea and the old massive hardware keyboards fade out. The only real issue is with stability and reliability on stage, but that will surely be overcome in time. It makes sense as the power of sample libraries and software synths is already pretty staggering, and control systems like Mainstage and Cantabile are more than fit for even top end professional work. We're just going to have to wean ourselves off our beloved hardware monsters and bite the bullet.

Sound quality was pretty good through the Yamaha pa provided but more difficult to gauge the overall sound quality for recording purposes at lower and upper ends. Some interesting sounds can be created relatively quickly which will perhaps appeal to users who want the immediacy of sound design rather than the complexity of the original FM keyboards. Its a 4-Operator FM synth but sadly the keyboard is not compatible with the large library of existing 4 Op FM patches as there are further editing options on the new model which were not available on the original synths.The 'CS' model has a more traditional synth design with lots of single sliders, a pretty decent filter with no obvious signs of 'stepping', and a range of LFO routing options (but only one option at a time). Was able to generate some interesting and useful pad and lead sounds with the OSC 'Mod' and 'Texture' sliders but nothing that cannot already be created with the single oscillator on the Stage 2. Overall I was left disappointed by the CS (not sure whether I have been spoiled by Nord).The sound quality of the CP and YC models seemed good and had all the basic stuff you need for electric piano and organ sounds plus the added bonus of effects, some of which on the CP were quite good for 'wacky' sound design. I have to say that I did not spend so much time on these as I have a NS2 which covers these elements already.Overall conclusion, I think it is fair to say that Yamaha are aiming these at the 'budget' market but for the price (currently £289 and likely to drop further to £249) they are pretty good entry points into the market if you want an FM or subtractive synth or want an organ or piano. I doubt you will ever see one of these on stage at a big gig (simply because they keyboard is too limiting due to lack of octaves) but for bedroom artists who want a decent sound to play with then you can't go too wrong. However, if you bought all four models to cover the bases, you'd be spending over £1,000 and for that money you could get a second hand stage or electro or a new Yamaha MOXF8 (or MOXF6 or Roland FA06 with a decent amount of change) and I think I would be hard pushed to say it would be a good investment to buy them all. Of the four, I would probably consider the DX model to experiment with some FM synthesis. I am sure Yamaha have done their homework  but I can't help thinking they might have missed a trick by not releasing modules or by combining the boards into one more affordable and useable package (with a full sized keyboard!!!). Who knows, more related products may come....",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=60827&sid=9b1dfa32370a9e7524f4695da8496a7e#p60827

(ok, nobody actually threw away a Prophet, but you get the idea...)Thescarything is, the newer the gear, the less likely it will be to work in the future.... some reasons:1960s- The earliest synths were made using discreet components, assembled by hand. If something fails, chances are a good electronics guy can fix it.1970s- Still mostly discreet components, microprocessor chips appear, but these can be still be replaced today, if you can find one (e.g. CEM, SSM chips)1980s,- integrated circuits - which means it's no longer possible to repair - you have to source a chip or a replacement circuit board.1990s- integrated circuits are even smaller and more manufacturer-specific. Software drivers, editors etc. will not run on modern computers.2000s- combination of the ban on lead solder and the continued shrinking in size of integrated circuits leads to the problem of tin-whiskering, which willkill your gear!http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2 ... ngineering2010s- by now, some gear actually needs software running on computers (e.g. Nord Modular). In future, the software is no longer supported and the computers and the operating systems they use are obsolete. You can keep an old computer, yes. Did you read about tin-whiskering?

(And either way, to even attempt it, you'd have to have a Nord and a Yamaha at your disposal to begin with.)The Nord is a much better organ than any Yamaha; piano is a tougher call, especially with the Motif XF (or MOXF) which allows you to load additional piano sounds besides the stock versions. For the other sounds you mentioned (strings, brass, flutes, accordion, sax), I'd give the edge to the Yamaha, though there are some very nice Nord sounds for some of these things as well. The Yamaha has a lot more versatility in terms of things like your ability to edit, split, and layer the sounds.If you like Nord sounds and Yamaha sounds, I'd say forget about trying to get the sounds of one into the other, and use both keyboards. To keep cost down, you don't have to go all the way to the Motif XF... you can get most of its capabilities at a lower cost out of the new MOXF, and you can even get a lot of its sounds out of the even lower cost MX if you really want to keep the cost down (the mx49 goes for $500).

Wheels are not typically used for the sounds the Electro was designed for; and modulation wheels typically control an LFO and there is no LFO per se in the Nord. It may help to remember that the Nord was never designed to be a synthesizer. It's designed for pianos, organs, and sample playback. As it happens, as the sample library expanded, they included some synth sounds, but that doesn't make the Nord a synth. Essentially it is merely playing back recordings of synth sounds, without providing much ability to modify them.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=38615&sid=9b1dfa32370a9e7524f4695da8496a7e#p38615

I think the microKorg XL wins agains it, better features, higher flexibility.Also, I think the Jupiter 80 is somehow a descendant of the JD-800, but it lacks the very cool physical interface.

Looking around for advice and assistance, the Nord user forums have been tremendously helpful, and I've quickly and shamelessly pillaged the Programs forums for all of my favorite user-submitted programs.  I'm anxiously awaiting the time that my synth skills allow me to start giving back and making my own contributions to this incredible resource.What I'm finding, however, is that when keyboardists post their sounds, they are not keyboard/synth agnostic.  In the Nord forums, fully constructed programs will be posted, but what good is that to a Korgist?  As far as I know, the only way to expose the programming of that sound is to load it into a Nord.So here's the dream.  I'd love to see a forum in which users post details of the programming they used to build those sounds.  For example:Katy Perry - California GurlsSaw wavecutoff: 262 HzLow pass filter (24 dB)etc etc etc...A model like this would allow the entire synth community to contribute and collaborate, effectively crowd-sourcing the reproduction of the synth sounds in the songs we want to play.  This could be an incredible resource.  In fact, it's such an obvious idea that I figure one of the following must be true:This resource already exists, and my Google skills aren't good enough to find it.There's some fundamental issue with the idea that I don't understand because I'm still a synth newbie.But if neither of those are the case, then I am pretty dead set on putting that computer science degree to use and building a proper home for agnostic synth collaboration somewhere on the interwebs.Thoughts?

The lack of precision doesn't outweigh the benefits of creating a community that's open toallkeyboardists.  It also doesn't outweigh the educational value of the process of building the programs yourself.  Furthermore, because you're building the program yourself, step by step, you've been hearing how the starting sound morphs as you use each control.  I'd say having just heard that process will make it a lot easier for even a newbie to finish out the sound on his or her respective synth.By the way, just read your description of how to build Cory Henry's Moog sound, and it was fantastic.  Now just imagine a home base for all synth programmers to do the same...  It's beautiful.Any other comments?  Does this already exist?  Should it exist?  Unless someone convinces me not to, I'm pretty sure I'm making a site and trying to goad this community into posting there to kickstart things...← Love this.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=48226&sid=9b1dfa32370a9e7524f4695da8496a7e#p48226

With a typical analog type, think of the number of oscillators and waveforms, for example. Filters do not perform all the same, modulation levels and routings between the various modules are not the same either, some EGs are linear, some are logarithmic and so on. All those differences make it difficult to replicate a particular sound, let alone generate a language to describe a state that does not translate accurately.Some synths are famous for a reason: they can do what others cannot, and samplers (the ultimate sound replication instrument) have become popular to overcome the difficulty of replicating sounds by synthesis alone.You might find these articles interesting.http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/apr99/a ... 20tips.htmhttp://www.synthmania.com/Famous%20Sounds.htmhttp://www.musicradar.com/tuition/tech/ ... als-224845",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=48245&sid=9b1dfa32370a9e7524f4695da8496a7e#p48245

Their lexicon is not the same, because their alphabet is restricted to the implementation of their modules. This is more of a philosophical question. Now that you brought ""universal languange"" into this discussion, perhaps you would find interesting Umberto Eco'sIn search for the perfect language. A bit heavy going in parts, but an interesting read nevertheless.As an example, if you want to make a typical analog synth to sound like a plucked string (i.e. K-S) algorithm, you would struggle big time in trying to explain the K-S algorithm to a Mini Moog owner because the Moog does not have a waveguide module implemented. Same with FM, and that is what gives different machines their personality. There is no simple translation from one 'model' of sound into the other unless the language allows you to describe the algorithm that goes with it. But even if you are able to do so, the receiving end does not have the ability to implement alternative algorithms.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=48281&sid=9b1dfa32370a9e7524f4695da8496a7e#p48281

However, MIDI does allow you to trigger the sounds in your Nord from another keyboard (your controller) which is, I think, what you're trying to do.Second, the Nord is monotimbral... one sound at a time. You simply cannot play two of its sounds at the same time, and MIDI does not change that. If you have the Nord set for piano, and you connect another controller, yes, you can play the Nord from the controller, but all it will let you play is the same piano sound that you are playing on the Nord itself. You can't play the piano sound from the Nord's keyboard and the Nord's organ sound from the controller at the same time, because at any given time, the Nord can either generate its piano sound or its organ sound, never both simultaneously, even if you ""add more keys"" from the controller.

Nord was first to do this on a commercial scale and coined the term Virtual Analog to describe this.

And many would take exception with the term ""artificial sound.""  Sound is sound.  If it makes noise, it's sound.Personally, from about 1988 until 2010 when I got with Nord, my rig always consisted of a single keyboard connected to a rack of midi modules, but I always refer to these modules as ""keyboards.""

The RD800 is an excellent keyboard and I really hoped it would leapfrog the Nord - it is a lot cheaper.  The action is great and the interface is good; it's very flexible for creating split / layer set-ups.  In many ways it is better than the Nord: the display is better, splits more flexible, great strings / pads / brass and loads of other sounds on board, better action (subjective), better outputs (includes XLR), lots of illuminated knobs, nicer keys, quieter keybed etc.  But.... I just enjoyed the Nord more when I played it.  With the RD800, the organ lets it down (you can sort of change 4 of the 9 drawbars in real time; you chose which 4 you edit and can't easily edit the middle bar at all), and the vintage keys just aren't as cool. The new Nord piano samples just seem more fun to play somehow, maybe more expressive.  There are many fewer realtime editing options on the RD800 too, e.g. kicking in a bit of extra distortion on the organ is tricky, and you don't have the same concept of morph / assign.Given the capability of the very cheap Roland VR09 (includes drawbars and iPad interface), I was expecting the RD800 to include these and beat the Nord Stage 2 hands-down, but it didn't and I prefer the Nord :-/I haven't given the Korg Kronos a decent thrashing, but that looks interesting if you're particularly into setups etc.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=44101&sid=9b1dfa32370a9e7524f4695da8496a7e#p44101

Go to the page athttp://usa.yamaha.com/products/musical- ... oxf/moxf6/and click the tab for ""additional sample library.""If you don't care about the flash memory, the MOXF is still better than the MOX it replaced, because it has more polyphony, more ROM sounds, more simultaneous effects... and even as it was, I thought the MOX was one of the best boards for the money.But if you DO want to load additional sounds (free ones, paid ones, or ones of your own), it's only $150 more to get 512 mb, bringing you to a total of $1350. That's still the cheapest board you can get with flash memory for downloading new sounds. The Nords start at $2200 (with less memory, and only single velocity layer samples available except for their own piano library), Kurzweil at $2500 (only 128 mb flash), Kronos at $3200 (but okay, that gives youtonsof custom sample capacity).So I guess I really can't agree about ""you could have bought something better than the MOXF to begin with"" -- I think the MOXF with no flash at $1200 or with flash at $1350 (or $1500 with a gig) are great values, and even if you budget some extra money for sample libraries, I don't think there's anything clearly better at the price, if it's at all the kind of board you're looking for (i.e. a ""cover it all"" rompler). Of course if you specifically are looking for clonewheel organ or VA synth, it's not the right board, flash or no.EDIT: I realized that the thread is discussing the MOXF8 in particular, and my prices and comparisons were for 61-key boards. But the same idea holds for the 88s. $1700 for a MOXF8 that is better than the previous $1700 MOX8 is a perfectly good value by itself. $150 more for 512 mb if you want it is still a nice value compared to $2800 for the least expensive weighted action (73 key) Nord, $3500 for the weighted Kurzweil PC3K, $3700 for a weighted (73) Kronos. So again, if user-loadable flash is of interest to you, Yamaha is the cheapest way to get there, by far. And if you don't care about the flash, get the board without it, it's still a good value board IMO.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=35926&sid=9b1dfa32370a9e7524f4695da8496a7e#p35926

I haven't really paid attention to the ads or promotional material, so I won't comment on how up front they are being. But I think, in a sense, they are marketing two keyboards... a MOX-priced MOX replacement that does everything the MOX did and more, and a slightly higher priced board with flash that is cheaper than any other board like it (well, two of those, i.e. a 512 mb version and a gig version). I think there are markets for both of these kinds of boards. But since the flash capability is a plug-in card, it is the same board, just with or without that card. So this means they only have to manufacture one board to serve both of these markets, and it also means that somebody who buys the first can always turn it into the second. So I think it's a win all around. People who don't need the flash don't need to buy it (and people were buying lots of less capable flash-less MOX at the same price before this came out, after all). People who want the flash can buy it whenever they want in whichever capacity they need. People who buy the basic version thinking it's all they need, who later discover the appeal of flash, can ""upgrade"" without having to buy a new keyboard.I guess I'm pretty psyched about it because it is almost exactly what I had been hoping Yamaha would come out with. I really like Yamaha's sounds, and I always wanted the flash capabilities of the Motif XF, but without the weight, bulk, expense. I only wish they had come out with a 76 key version with aftertouch.

Give it the capability to do one split (anywhere) OR one layer (possibly max of one piano and one synth at once, but two Hammonds, to keep down DSP power requirements), add in pitch-bend range, lose the Extern section, aftertouch and multiple outputs (apart from Electro-style).Call it something like the Nord Combi and price it about where the Electro/Piano HP are.Won't happen, but I can dream!Al",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=35958&sid=9b1dfa32370a9e7524f4695da8496a7e#p35958

The Nord Electro 4 HP weighs just a few pounds more.  I'm a studio & gigging musician. For all our shows, I double as a guitarist as well. I come to a show with guitars, amps and keys (and keyboard stage mixer).  Keeping the setup easy to manage is essential, especially given short setup and breakdown periods.

One application might be something like a guitar sound where you get mutes when you play soft, another sound when you play harder and maybe a feedback type sound when you play really hard.  In that example I'm only talking about using three layers when it is capable of up to six.   In many of the videos from NAMM I demonstrated some synth sounds that use all six layers.An orchestral simulation might be one example of needing more than six layers.  You can have timpani, brass and other parts trigger only when you play hard.  Using multiple zones and the other tools in the PX-5S like the phrase sequencer that can open up other possibilities (timpani rolls, harp arpeggios, brass riffs).Here is one example of something I was experimenting with last night.Zone 1:   HexLayer Guitar and Bass.  This is a 4 layer program.  3 layers are used for the guitar.  The 4th layer is a bass.This zone is the on the bottom half of the keyboard.Zone 2:  Organ, pretty straightforward on the top half.Another cool trick I'm using here is the phrase sequencer.  I'm only playing one note but it is playing a riff.  That riff will transpose with me as I play.https://soundcloud.com/casiomusicgear/p ... bass-organI believe they meant the ""S"" in the PX-5S to mean ""Stage"".

What is the difference between arpeggio and phrases? Is there a phrase per hex layer or how many can you have at at time?You should mention more about patterns on your website!An arpeggio is 16 steps and can consist of notes and controller data on each of those 16 steps (such as panning or filter).  While an arpeggio can have ties, the arpeggio's 16 steps are tied to a particular note value such as 16th notes or 8th notes and so on.   The Arpeggio can also be polyphonic, repeating a chord or whatever notes you're holding down to the particular pattern.  You're in control of an arpeggio, it is only going to play based on the note or notes that you play.A phrase is a MIDI recording.  It could be a drum pattern, a bass line, or 16 measure of chord changes for a particular song.   You can assign a phrase to a range of keys and the phrase will transpose across those keys....but you can't play more than one note for that phrase at time.  So from the keyboard you can start or stop a phrase and transpose it.  BTW: A phrase could also be controller other MIDI data.Each zone can choose EITHER a phrase or an arpeggio.  There are 4 zones on the PX-5S.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=33100&sid=4b324f46c164f287e57edfc2f0530385#p33100

Samples? Oscillators? What?Thanks!The sound engine is sample driven.   There are essentially 2 different sound engines in the PX-5S.  There are Tones and there are Hex Layers.Tones:  Roughly 350 Preset Tones, from which you can edit Amp Envelope, Filter / Filter Envelope, Pitch Envelope, Portamento and Insert effects.  The envelopes in this section are basically standard ADSRs with additional control over the ""Initial Attack Level"".   You can't get to the sample level of a Tone.  Basically all of the edits in this section function function as offsets of the factory preset.Hex Layers:  A single sound with up to 6 layers.  Each layer has 7 Stage Envelopes for Filter and Amp and independent Filter choices for each layer.  Each layer here can be split, velocity switched or simply layered on top of each other.  Each layer has its own Effects Mix to the System effects and can either use the insert effect or not.  You can choose from over 400 samples sets.  Tons of control over key-scaling for amp or filter and much much more.On the PX-5S have 4 zones available.  Only Zones 1 and 2 can use Hex Layer tones.  Your configuration of the 4 zones, their sounds, effects, key ranges...etc are store in what Casio calls a Stage Setting.  There are 100 User Stage Settings.   Any edits to the sounds within a Stage Setting can be stored within the Stage Setting, so you don't have to save them separately.   Each zone can be an internal sound, external MIDI device or both simultaneously.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=33102&sid=4b324f46c164f287e57edfc2f0530385#p33102

I don’t know how much Casio pay you, but I hope you’re in line for a pay rise, or at the very least, a large bonus.  Or maybe you’re one of those sickening people who only need three or four hours sleep a night  ;-So, to the PX-5S.  I’m very, very tempted, really I am.  The Hex layers, the polyphony, the way you can dial in the exact amount of distortion, on the fly.  However, on the other side of the coin, I would have liked a larger screen, maybe similar to the Korg Chrome, and I genuinely believe that Casio missed a trick in not giving us provision for an expression pedal.  Also, the procedure for setting the parameters seems fairly complex – although I accept that this will get easier as you get used to it.Now, the fly in the ointment.  Casio need to sort out their pricing policy.  Assuming the keyboards are made in Japan or China, I can’t see U.S. import duties and taxes being any less punitive than those in the U.K.  However, the U.S. price (Kraft, Sweetwater, Amazon) is $999, this equates to around £650.  The U.K. price (via Thomann) is £900.  This is a nearly a 40% mark up. I feel that the potential U.K. purchaser (i.e. me) is being ripped off to the tune of £250.  And this may just turn out to be a deal breaker.Thanks again for all your efforts on our behalf, I, for one really appreciate it.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=34607&sid=4b324f46c164f287e57edfc2f0530385#p34607

Great combo IMO.  The ability to use the weighted board of the PX-5S to play the piano and EP sounds on the NE4 is a real pleasure.  Then when I want to play the organ, I can hop up to the NE4 SW73 keyboard.  For songs like Smooth or Jessica, I use both boards simultaneously...the NE4 for organ and PX-5S for piano.   The PX-5S has good acoustic and electric piano sounds that sound different than the NE4 and a killer synth section with the ability to create up to fourteen layer sounds.  The PX-5s is a very flexible controller with six flexibly assignable sliders and four flexibly assignable knobs but one minor shortcoming it has with the Nord is that the PX-5S can't broadcast MIDI to any CC with a value 100 or greater.  For some reason, Nord didn't use conventional value assignments with some of its controllers as some are over 100.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=40343&sid=4b324f46c164f287e57edfc2f0530385#p40343

The main problem that I have with my old Rodgers W-50 (has a collection of sampled pipe organ voices) and my two Kawai K-3's is their limited polyphony.   Of course there is also no rhythm function, either, nor a good piano.  So i think it is high time to upgrade.  Also due to health problems I'm now completely retired and have time and funds to put into this.What piqued my interest was happening upon a u-tube of someone having so much fun with a Tyros 5.  Why not me?  A little research led me to the two ""K"" brands as well as Nord.  Comparing all these is difficult since the only brand carried by a local retailer is Yamaha and they only stock lower priced units.Right now I'd go for a Nord (or whatever brand) in a New York minute if they had an ample and expandable selection of pipe organ stops available.  The ultimate would be to be able to import and play Hauptwerk organs, say from flash cards.  Apparently there are so few of us organists that are more interested in pipe organs than combo organs that there isn't much incentive to provide extensive pipe organ voicing for us as they have done with the Hammond, Farfisa, etc. sounds  --  unless I've overlooked something.  At this point it looks like my only option is two or three inexpensive controller keyboards stacked up in some fashion and a dedicated PC  Hauptwerk.

Unless you lay your arm across the keys, you can't play more than 10 notes anyway. Now if you're generating each note from multiple component parts (like the stops on a real pipe organ, or the individual drawbar tones), that's different, but the sample section of the Nord doesn't permit that.With some effort, he could sample some of his favorite Hauptwerk sounds into an Electro, Stage 2, or MOXF (with flash card), but the C2D or Hammonds I mentioned would actually give him drawbar control of the stops, if he likes the pipe organ sounds of those instruments.In terms of the sampling route, the MOXF would provide more versatility. You could have up to a gigabyte of samples, and you can layer them in such a way as you could theoretically duplicate controls of different stops. Layering of the different tones would eat up polyphony, but since the MOXF has 128 tone polyphony, it shouldn't be an issue. But it would take a good amount of expertise to put it together.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=38811&sid=4b324f46c164f287e57edfc2f0530385#p38811

Given your criteria of needing to have ample stops (nord organ only has 8 swell, 8 great, 3 pedal) and being expandable without extra equipment (like running Hawptwerk via MIDI from a computer) I cannot recommend the Nord option. I personally think it is still the best option overall for someone like myself since it is the only 30 lb keyboard to my knowledge available that has provides that many stops + traditional performance features like couplers and the ability to change registrations using general piston type MIDI settings. Also very easy to integrate a pedalboard. Plus the killer B3 and euro type organs. Let me know if you have additional questions, I have tried the trial versions of hawptwerk with the nord and my have some insight if you are still considering it as an option.Cheers,micah",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=39760&sid=4b324f46c164f287e57edfc2f0530385#p39760

As a synth it is extremely limited in its capabilities. You're paying an awful lot basically for the kudos of owning one. The Voyager is simply in another league in terms of versatility - as are many others. True, the Minimoog will always have the edge of ""that sound"", but is it a sound you really need? Every synth has its own sound for you to use and shape in your own music, and there are plenty of iconic pieces of music and artistes that used synths that were not Minimoogs - the Bladerunner soundtrack, Weather Report, Genesis, Ultravox - the list is endless.Also bear in mind that the the Minimoog is not a rare instrument, so you don't need to rush out and buy the first one that comes along. I can understand the temptation, but you could spend 4k far more wisely.Still, if you do end up buying one, well, who could blame you?",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=31518&sid=4b324f46c164f287e57edfc2f0530385#p31518

MBP runs omnisphere which is controlled by the NE3 and outputs sound over a USB-audio interface like the FocusRite 2in2 which then goes into another DI box to the mixer.In principle that should work, but there might be some gotchas.Also, the Scarlett 2i2 already has balanced outputs, so you could skip the 2nd DI box and directly connect the 2i2 with balanced cables (TRS jacks) to the StudioLive mixer without any loss of quality.I briefly looked at getting a Presonus StudioLive mixer myself, so I'm a bit familiar with it; wouldn't you be able to skip the 2i2 and connect your laptop via firewire to the StudioLive, so you get your Omnisphere sound directly in a (stereo) channel on the mixer? Of course, that requires your laptop to have a firewire port and maybe there's already some other device connected to the mixer for recording purposes.How would you run Omnisphere on the MBP? Would you run it stand-alone, or in some DAW or plugin host?As to the gotchas I mentioned: I see two.If you change programs on the NE3, Omnisphere will also change programs - I think that is a good thing though. You could carefully set up your NE3 and Omnisphere so that programs on the NE3 and Omnisphere match. For example, program 1 in the NE3 and program 1 on Omnisphere are supposed to be used together. If you then want to play something where you either want the NE3 or Omnisphere to be silent, create a silent program for that location. For example, program 5 on the NE3 might be an organ sound, while program 5 on Omnisphere has 0 volume.You would then only change programs on the Nord and Omnisphere would happily follow. Of course, you could also configure the Nord not to send any program change messages, which would allow you to switch programs on the NE3 without Omnisphere changing programs.The second gotcha has to do with transposing the keyboard; I don't see a good way of doing this, unless Omnisphere itself (or the DAW/plugin host you run it in) has an option to do this. You might however be able to work around this by pitching up (or down) the oscillators in a patch. For example, if C3 on the NE3 needs to play C5 in Omnisphere, it will probably work fine if you pitch the oscillators in Omnisphere up 24 semitones._kanon wrote:My budget is flexible (preferably under 1000)...omnisphere + usb audio interface is roughly 500-600~.You could start without a USB audio device and run a cable from the MBP's audio output to a DI box and then to the mixer. The quality will likely be better via a decent external interface though.And if you want to get really fancy and get rid of the computer, you could have a look at a Muse Research MuseBox or Receptor - these are essentially special purpose computers optimized for music applications and they should be more reliable than a computer. They're also well outside your budget. There's also the SM Pro Audio V-Machine, which does something similar but is much more affordable (should fit well within your budget). I don't have any experience with either line of products (and I'm a bit skeptical about whether the V-Machine can run a heavy plugin such as Omnisphere), but it might be worth looking into it.http://www.museresearch.com/products/musebox.phphttp://www.museresearch.com/products/index.phphttp://www.smproaudio.com/index.php/en/ ... /v-machineEdit: additional gotcha - the NE3 doesn't have a mod wheel, though I suppose you could use an expression pedal.

MIDI messages till get sent out the MIDI OUT port though and the sound engine still respond to MIDI messages received on MIDI IN - this also means that when you turn Local Control off and plug a MIDI cable between the MIDI OUT and MIDI IN ports, you can still play your Electro.When you turn your Electro off and back on again, Local Control defaults back to on._kanon wrote:My question now is how do I use the Nords internal sounds like you've mentioned here in an older thread?

I'm still using mainstage, a usb-interface (for macbook out >> mixer) and the midi-usb cable to go from my NE3 to macbook pro.You set Local Control to off, so you can use your Electro as a controller for Mainstage - this means the Electro will not make sound when you play the local keyboard. You then connect the Electro's MIDI OUT port to the MIDI IN port of your computer's MIDI interface and connect your computer's MIDI OUT port to your Electro's MIDI IN port - the Electro can now send MIDI to your computer (need since you want to use it as a controller) and the computer can now send MIDI to the sound engine of your Electro, since you want Mainstage to control that.Now check the MIDI channel settings in your Electro and in Mainstage and make sure the channel used matches. Note that for the organ you have an upper and a lower manual; the upper manual uses the regular MIDI channel setting, while the lower manual uses an additional setting, Lower MIDI channel.While you could connect the outputs of your Electro directly to the mixer, that is not what you want to do for a number of reasons; instead, connect them to the audio inputs if your audio interface. This allows Mainstage to compensate for any delays caused by MIDI, etc (so the internal sounds of Mainstage and sounds made by your Electro run perfectly in sync) and it also allows you to apply additional effects (Mainstage) to the sound made by your Electro, like reverb or flanger.Getting this to work is one thing, but getting this to work -the way you want- for a live situation is another and will take some time to figure out and set up. For example, since Mainstage is controller your Electro's sound engine and you're controlling Mainstage from the Electro's keyboard (and knobs, etc) you may need to 'teach' Mainstage what you want specific buttons on the Electro to do. For example, out of the box the drawbar buttons probably don't do what you want them to do (Mainstage doesn't know what to do with them) - I think you can 'teach' Mainstage what you want them to do, but I never tested that myself. Another example is changing programs on the Electro; that will now change programs in Mainstage. If the sound engine in the Electro needs to change program in response to you changing the program on the Electro, you need to configure Mainstage to do that. For example, program 16 in Mainstage might correspond to program 70 in the Electro and program 17 might correspond to program 11 in the Electro. If you are on program 16 and switch to program 17 on the Electro, Mainstage will switch from 16 to 17 and tell the Electro to switch to 11 (from 70).This might all be a bit confusing, but if you play around with it, I think it will become much clearer. You can set up Mainstage exactly the way you want, but for a home situation that probably wouldn't really be needed since you could just grab the mouse and change some stuff.Please don't hesitate to ask additional question or ask for clarification if I was unclear. I have Mainstage myself, but don't use it much (I mostly use Ableton Live).",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=37312&sid=4b324f46c164f287e57edfc2f0530385#p37312

Your help has been invaluable.I've gotten to play around with everything and so far so good. Here's what I've managed to do so far:-Control pads/keys/patches in mainstage with my NE3 (hurray)-Control faders in mainstage via an iPad app.Here's what I'm going to try and figure out now:-The biggest thing: Changing between internal sounds using Mainstage. I'm not quite sure how to do this. I know Mainstage doesn't accept SysEx information. BUT I might be able to bypass that using the ""Send CC"" function. But honestly I have no idea what midi information that contains. Does that have information on what instrument the Nord is currently using?-2nd biggest thing: using the knobs on the nord to control faders in Mainstage WITHOUT controlling whatever internal sound effects those knobs originally contained. To do this I'm thinking you have to just make sure Mainstage doesn't send midi information back to any of the ""proper channel"" for those knobs. Example being: reverb knob on the NE3 is in Midi channel 1, subchannel 88. If Mainstage sends midi information back to that channel, it'll change the reverb. Likewise if it sends it back for anything like the phase/flanger channels, it'll change that internally too. I think...The last thing I can think of at the moment is that in a perfect world, Mainstage would be able to switch instruments on my Nord just by recognizing that the particular instrument in use. Say I switch to a patch with:1 pad1 NE3 RhodesIdeally I'd like my Nord to make that switch to the Rhodes when I switch patches. But I have a feeling that it's a bit too complicated for Mainstage. Instead what I probably will have to do (if it even works) is assign buttons to all of my internal NE3 sounds that store the ""Send CC"" information"" and when I switch patches that switch NE3 sounds, just select the appropriate patch. Now, it might be possible to write an apple script of some kind (basic if programming..?) to determine what NE3 patch is needed by mainstage (maybe by name) and then automatically pressing the button for the ""Send CC"" information. I have no idea if it could work but that would be an even more fluid transition.**Edit**I realized and I think you might of mentioned this: you can probably change program information (like the NE3s Program A/B | #1,2,3,etc) via midi...but I'm not exactly sure how. There's still a lot to learn!**Edit 2**So I found a program called SysEx Librarian:http://www.snoize.com/SysExLibrarian/The reason for using this program lies with the fact that Mainstage cannot accept SysEx MIDI information...thus you can't change patches and sounds...at least not normally. This program is able to listen for SysEx dumps and record them. If you set the output of a button in MS3 to SysEx Librarian, assign a unique program change, and then match that up with the proper SysEx information in SysEx Librarian, you should be able to have Mainstage signal Librarian to send the SysEx information back to your synthesizer or in my case, my NE3. Thus you can change sounds on the NE3 through your computer! I'm haven't tried this yet but from the information I've seen so far it should work without too much trouble. Now....to figure out how to Applescript it so it works without me having to press anything...AKA using the applescript to send out the unique program change midi information instead of a button. Now that would pretty coolLet me know what you think! I appreciate it again. Thanks",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=37396&sid=4b324f46c164f287e57edfc2f0530385#p37396

It was easy to use and program, but I thought the sound didn't really have anything special.It also felt rather plastic-y, though I'm sure it is very sturdy, probably more sturdy than some other synths that feel more substantial (and cost much, much more).

USB could also work, but is a harder to implement as it requires USB host support (most boards like this only have USB device support).Something like a Teensy is Arduino compatible (so you can use their development environment) but is so small it'll easily fit inside a keyboard.Edit: it might be fun to remove the PS/2 connector on one of those coiled cables and to mount a MIDI (DIN5) connector on itYou might even be able to run all the electronics from the power provided by the MIDI port, although that's not officially supported.Edit: that only works when receiving MIDI - doh!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=30518&sid=4b324f46c164f287e57edfc2f0530385#p30518

Without testing anything, I think the following circuit could work:It would probably be easier (and more likely to work) to use a Teensy++ 2.0 instead of designing the circuit myself. In either case, a regulated 5V power supply would need to be connected to the keyboard (unfortunately). With the Teensy, it might be possible to have the thing function both as a USB and as a MIDI keyboard (haven't looked at this, but this just occured to me) where the external power supply wouldn't be needed anymore (if connected via USB).The ESC key could function as a MIDIpanicbutton. Keep it pressed down while powering up and you enter a simple settings menu that uses the three LEDs (caps lock, scroll lock and num lock) for feedback and the keys for selecting options.While playing, pressing any of the function keys (F1 thru F12) changes the velocity sent from 1 to 127 (probably on some logarithmic scale). The numeric keypad could may be be used to select between different musical scales for the main keys. You can have multiple keys pressed down and the software will correctly handle the sending of note on/off MIDI messages.Anyway, just thinking out loud (and completely ignoring the fact the software is the most complicated part)...",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=30532&sid=4b324f46c164f287e57edfc2f0530385#p30532

All you'd have to do is execute a few shell commands to connect your virtual keyboard to a MIDI channel. Linux also provides a complete implementation of MIDI over ethernet in the standard ALSA-MIDI stack.I guess the Raspberry thing would not be much more expensive than an Arduino with the additional parts to connect keyboard and MIDI. However, the new ones have an extra USB port, so I might be wrong. Nevertheless, a Raspberry would be able to do pretty much the whole thing out of the box.

I'm very blessed to have the gear that I have but I don't think its all the right fit and I'm looking for some advice.I've got a Nord Stage 2 (HA76) which I absolutely love.   I love the sound, the power and the live adaptability that if offers.  I have never loved playing a keyboard as much as I do the NS2.  It is primarily used for a lot of piano and organ type sound and some real low end synth stuff.   The best thing about it is the ability to manipulate things live in a very quick and easy way.  Also the layout of both the software that allows fairly quick changes and the live settings which I can use for probably 50% of what I like to play.My secondary keyboard is currently an MOX6.  I really love most everything about it.  The keys feel great for what it is, the choice of voices is really quite good.  I use it primarily for strings, brass and most of the secondary stuff that I need.  I also use some MIDI to it to blend.  It is a really nice keyboard.The issue I have with the MOX6 is that it is a pain trying to change anything.  On the NS2 you can replace a single voice and arrange voices in any way you want.  Most of the additional voices available on the MOX6 blast your ""favorites"" and wipe out an entire bank of sounds.I'm looking for suggestions for a replacement to the MOX6 that offers a bit more of a performance machine like the Stage rather than a workstation.  I'd also like to diversify a bit voicewise and not necessarily have another Nord in the rig.  My preference would be more toward 61 key setup.Any suggestions as to what to look at?",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=32742&sid=4b324f46c164f287e57edfc2f0530385#p32742

The Yamahas are notoriously a pain to operate, but the user interfaces on most brands work in a broadly similar way. The Korgs - Tritons and Kronos - are often said to be easier to operate than most. I have a Triton Extreme, and although the  UI is good for a workstation, nevertheless it is still a complex web of menu-after-menu-after-menu.Simply put, these types of synths have so many parameters to edit that it is not really possible to give them a Nord-style interface - the front panel would be the size of a door. That is one of the things about the Nords, they really make everything else look so clumsy by comparison - at the cost of giving you a limited set of features to edit.Your options include:Using a computer editor if possible, as some of these have better layouts than the  instrument's front panel.Using a different type of synth - but this might not give you the sample-based sounds it seems you need.Using a synth that will give you a simpler front panel at the expense of having a limited feature set, like an MX49 or MX61.One possible option could be the new and much-admired Casio Privia Pro PX-5S, but that has a full 88 note kbd (although it is *very* light for its size).Although I am not familiar with the MOX6, I am very surprised that it can only load banks of sounds and not single patches (or voices, or whatever).",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=32751&sid=4b324f46c164f287e57edfc2f0530385#p32751

On the NS2 you can replace a single voice and arrange voices in any way you want.  Most of the additional voices available on the MOX6 blast your ""favorites"" and wipe out an entire bank of sounds.From the particular problem you're mentioning, it sounds like you're talking about loading in optional sound libraries (which often are set to automatically load themselves as a set into the first user bank, which is often where you may have your favorites). Managing Voices on the MOX is a bit of a pain, but you can buy John Melas' Total Librarianhttp://www.jmelas.gr/motif/lib.phpwhich I think will give you the same kind of functionality you're used to from the Nord Sound Manager, and should pretty much alleviate that problem. (You can download a free demo.)But also, when you're comparing to other keyboards, most of them don't have this issue, in part because most of them don't have alternate libraries of sounds that you can load in the first place! That is, there are no alternate voice banks to load into an MX or Krome, so over-writing existing voices isn't an issue. There are new sounds you can load into a Jupiter, and managing that has been even more of a bane to Jupiter users than the Yamaha situation is to Yamaha users.So in a way, you could stick with the MOX and just use its stock voices and your own programmed sounds, and be no ""worse off"" than many other keyboards where that is pretty much all you can do anyway. Or you could download that librarian and more easily work with the third party sound libraries as well.One thing I like about the combination of the MOX and NS2 is that Yamaha's Master mode actually provides better Nord patch selection than the Nord does for itself. From the NS2's front panel, you have single-button access to 5 stored programs, each of which can also call up MOX sounds (via the Nord's EXT function). But if you do it the other way, from the MOX's front panel, you have single button access to 16 stored programs, each of which can also call up Nord sounds... plus you can hit a button and see the NAMES of the 16 stored programs before calling one up. (And if you navigate to the next bank of 16 buttons, you again can hit a button to see what is then assigned to those 16 buttons, and so on.) I think banks of 16 buttons with names is more useful than banks of 5 buttons without! But you still do have to give some thought to either programming the needed combinations of Nord and Yamaha sounds into those single buttons, or maybe dedicating some buttons to Yamaha sounds and some to Nord sounds, and then hitting buttons accordingly.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=32762&sid=4b324f46c164f287e57edfc2f0530385#p32762

This works especially well with using the Nord with Local Control turned off (on the Nord).Thanks very much for the informative reply.As far as i can remember, i did not actually do anything specific within Cubase to define the Nord as being a 'controller' keyboard.  If anything, i turned lots of things OFF on the Nord (eg. the External Section) because i was getting Midi conflicts.i just checked and yes the Nord is on Midi Channel 1 (External Section is OFF) and regardless of what Midi Channel each individual Midi Track is on within Cubase, the Nord still triggers that channel.  For instance, Midi Track 10 has drums and i also assigned it to Midi Channel 10, my Nord is on Channel 1, and its still triggering the drum sound.So i think this is what you mean in that i am using it correctly and in the same fashion that you are ??",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=32091&sid=4b324f46c164f287e57edfc2f0530385#p32091

If I'd do the same with my Nord, pressing the sustain pedal should only be sent to those tracks. If I also used the Nord as a controller (configured as such in the DAW), the sustain pedal would both be sent to any track which has it selected as a MIDI source (input) but also to the one I happen to have selected.At the moment, in Cubase my Track #01 is currently an Audio Track.  Therefore there is no Midi Channel settings possible for this Track.  Only Midi Tracks can have Midi Channel configurations and Audio Tracks have IN/OUT sources relating to the soundcard (as you will obviously already know).So i am still baffled as to why the Sustain Pedal on the Nord (which i have checked within Cubase and CC-064 is the ONLY information being transmitted from the Nord sustain pedal to Cubase) is turning ON/OFF the SOLO/MUTE switch on a different Audio Track to the one i am recording on ??If i have (say) 4 x Audio (or Midi) Tracks in Cubase and i record on each of them one at a time (as you would normally do) playing my Nord, the sustain pedal works totally fine for each of the 4 x Tracks during both recording and playback.  In other words, it functions perfectly as a sustain pedal should in all respects.

This is regarding the programing of having Cubase call up the original exact settings (on the Nord) of the Preset configuration for the START of a song.So, if i record in as a Midi Track a (say) Piano Patch on the Nord which (at the start of the song) is 'dry'.  Then halfway thu the song i activate the reverb switch (on the Nord) so that the Piano now has FX on it.  This latter mentioned event gets recorded (in Cubase) as Midi information during the initial recording and subsequently turns the reverb ON (on the Nord) at the same point during playback.  i may well come back to this later on in this thread, but for now my big question is this :-i need Cubase to RESET (if thats the correct term) the Nord to having its reverb switch to OFF at the very start of the song.  Just to be very clear about the scenario, when the song reaches the END the Piano has the reverb ON.  Now, if i want to replay the song i press rewind on the (Cubase) Transport Panel to move the Playback Line back to Bar #01.  Now when i press Play, Cubase triggers all the notes on the Nord but the Nord (FX) is 'wet' (as it was at the end of the song).  What i need is to get Cubase to RESET the Nord back to the original state required at the start of the song (ie. a Piano Patch with reverb turned OFF).As far as i am aware (and after much experimentation) there are TWO possibilities to choose from.  One would be to set within Cubase CC numbers/values so that they turn On/Off the various parameters as required.  This would require different LANES to be created (in Cubase) and then the approriate CC numbers/values configured in each of these Lanes.  In the case of a Nord Patch consisting of Drawbar settings, Synth Section tweaks, FX/EQ/Amp settings etc, this would make for a hell of a lot of CC numbers to be set and stored in Cubase !!  Though of course this is possible and once you have worked out and written down the matching CC numbers then you have got them for life.The other way was to set the Nord Patch up via SYSTEM EXCLUSIVE.  i pressed Record (in Cubase) and then PATCH DUMP (on the Nord) and the information was sent.    However, i am not at all sure how relaible this method would be.  And also i would need to leave some kind of gap at the start of the song in order for the SYS EX to be Transmitted to the Nord (and set up the Patch) ??Thanks a lot.................",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=32150&sid=4b324f46c164f287e57edfc2f0530385#p32150

Both methods work fine. The advantage of using a Sysex dump is that the sound data is then always contained in the Cubase song (handy if you ever decide to come back and redo or remix the song at a later date), whereas using a Program Change means that you would have to keep track of the Program you used in the Nord itself. On the other hand, reloading the Sysex dump may take a little longer, so a good place to record (and playback) the Sysex data would be during the count-in. Cubase's track parameters allow you to set a Program Change at the beginning of the song if you prefer to do it that way.One issue with using the Sysex data dump is that, if you edit the Program at all during your session, you would have to remember to re-record the altered Program data as a fresh Sysex dump.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=32153&sid=4b324f46c164f287e57edfc2f0530385#p32153

In other words it changes the Organ Preset into the Piano Preset which was dumped via Sys Ex.  i thought it would make the Nord simply jump back to Location #01 which was where the original Preset is stored and which was the Location in operation during the Sys Ex Patch Dump ??",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=32163&sid=4b324f46c164f287e57edfc2f0530385#p32163

For example, if you had recorded Sustain pedal, Mod wheel data, or Program Changes, and then jumped to a different location, say back to the beginning of the song, Cubase scans through and resets these controllers to where they should be. This is chasing. If it didn't do this, things could get muddled, as jumping to a location could leave these controllers in the wrong position and without chasing, Cubase would have no idea how these controllers should be set at the new location.(Sorry, that's a late night bare-bones description.

Eight fellow Forum users responded, and I thank each of you for the input and help.  I considered all of your opinions carefully and I have decided to go with a NS2-88 for my bottom board, and a Roland Jupiter 80 for my top board.   I will join the Forum as a proud owner of these beautiful instruments, and as I learn the new red ""beast"", I will be on this forum reading and researching topics and techniques.It's a hard and difficult decision picking new axes and not making an expensive mistake.  As a working jazz and blues player, I've got to have the best for gigging.  I was leaning towards a Yamaha CP1 and a Kronos X73, however, in following the advise of one of the gentleman who responded in this post, I drove 3.5 hours to St. Louis to check out the Kronos and Jupiter 80, In addition I got to check out a Nord C2 organ.I eliminated the CP1 because of cost ($5000), and weight (60lb.), and I felt that the Nord wasn't a big drop off in terms of the quality of piano and electric piano sounds.  The Nord certainly holds it's own against the CP1 and Roland V-Piano heavyweights, and offers many more options with the organ and synth engines and it's portability.  All of these issues were pointed out by  Forum members.After spending a couple of hours playing the Kronos, I came away not impressed.  The build quality is awful; the sliders, buttons and dials felt cheap and flimsy.  For every great sound there were 10 you would never use.  It's a large cumbersome board that's difficult to navigate in my opinion.  In fact, I felt the Motif XF was more intuitive than the Kronos.  I also felt the Kronos piano sounds were average at best.On the other hand, I loved the Roland Jupiter 80.  I had a Jupiter 8 back in the 80's, and I cut my teeth on analog synthesis.  This board does not disappoint, and it has a fantastic build quality.  The piano, organ and solo instrument sounds are all quite good, and the synth stuff is off the charts.  The board has an intuitive and easy layout to navigate, and with some tweaking and work you can set up stellar registrations which are combinations or various sounds.  Hugh sound possibilities, and with version 2 released, this board should be a perfect compliment to the NS2.I also got to try out a Nord C2, it was awesome.  The C2d is on my wish list!Again, I would like to thank each of the respondents for their thoughtful opinions.

Adding multiple devices on a single MIDI port increases latency, simply because that MIDI port will be busier. Not really a problem for note on/off message, but if you have something timing-critical on that MIDI port (like a drum machine, or something else with sounds with a very short attack phase) you'd probably be able to hear timing is a bit sloppy.Some of the better MIDI interfaces have a feature where they send MIDI data a bit earlier to the interface than it is needed and they send some additional timing data with it (MOTU calls this MIDI Time Stamping, but other vendors have different names for this). Using this, for example, they can send out multiple messages on multiple ports at exactly the same time (something that otherwise wouldn't be possible). Nice for timing accuracy, but there are downsides; you need special drivers and this only works for playback from a DAW, since it partially depends on the DAW compensating for MIDI latency.I have an E-MU 1x1 and it works just fine; it doesn't need drivers (= class compliant), but only has a single port. I also have a Cakewalk (Roland) UM-3G, which has three ports and does support the 'MIDI Time Stamping' thing (or whatever Cakewalk/Roland call it), but it doesn't work without installing their drivers.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=30657&sid=4b324f46c164f287e57edfc2f0530385#p30657

If your headphones provide a decent amount of damping it can even help prevent hearing problems (because you can run then at normal/safe levels), but if they don't provide enough damping you'll likely run the headphone at levels that will put your hearing at risk (even more so than with just the noise at a gig).As a gigging musician you need to be even more careful with your hearing, since a lot (most?) gigging musicians will sustain some degree of hearing loss.My point is this: look for some in-ear monitors specifically meant for the job you intend to use them for (or at least check they provide a decent amount of damping, say at least 12-18 dB). Your hearing will thank you (if it could).Note that in-ear headphones with good to very good damping aren't the most comfortable to wear, unless you have custom molds made for them. I have a set of Shure E2Cs (like them a lot) and I use them with silicon sleeves. If I haven't worn them for a while, they'll give me sore ear canals (and a bit of a head ache) but once I've worn them for a few hours over the course of a week or two that completely goes away. I'm not a gigging musician or anything like that, but I sometimes need to work/concentrate in noisy surroundings and the damping (and the ability to play mysic at fairly low levels) helps me.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=29299&sid=4b324f46c164f287e57edfc2f0530385#p29299

You can see it in use in some of our videos.We use it to get rid of any foldback (and feedback) and to speed up our gig setup times.However - we only use it for the vocals and sax player (left earpiece = loud vocals/Quiet sax; right earpiece = loud sax/quiet vocals). Each person only wears one earpiece so they can hear the rest of the mix naturally. This stops us from being ""disconnected"" on stage.This isn't the scenario you're talking about thoughAnother alternative to the bluetooth mentioned above would be a small 4 channel mixer with headphone output and Aux Send.Such asBehringer Xenyx 802- You could then take the electro sound through the Stereo Inputs (and then on to the main PA mix on its own through the Aux Send).Add a static microphone placed in front of your Electro to capture the rest of the sound on stage. You could then take a mix through your own headphones which had your Electro at the volume you want and the rest of the band (through the mic) at a suitable volume.I expect this would cost less and also not be so reliant on replacing batteries/charging before every gig - it may also be something you could try easily (as you may have a small mixer and mic already!).Hope this helps,Rob.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=29319&sid=4b324f46c164f287e57edfc2f0530385#p29319

It has ""over 1000,"" the full set would be 1217 ("" 1,024 Normal Voices + 64 Drum Kits, GM: 128 Normal Voices + 1 Drum Kit"")Yamaha boards also contain ""performances"" which are combinations of the underlying voices, and those differ among the models... they need to because of other differences, like some boards are capable of more simultaneous voices or more simultaneous effects than others, for example. There are other differences of course... like the feel of the keyboard, whether the keys have aftertouch, what auxiliary controls are available (sliders, pedals, ribbon, etc.), total polyphony, screen... really, a whole lot of other things, apart from the sounds themselves.In terms of the other thing you said, soundquality, I don't know. I've read where some people feel that the same voice sounds better when played on, for example, an XF rather than a MOX... people have talked about the possibility of higher quality electronics, i.e. better quality DACs, etc., but I don't know about that for a fact.One thing about the old Motif ES, though, is that it could take PLG expansion cards, which gave it some other sonic capabilities (virtual analog, acoustic instrument modeling, etc.) and those expansion cards are not compatible with the subsequent XS+ series.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=24904&sid=4b324f46c164f287e57edfc2f0530385#p24904

That's a much smaller ROM considering that it has ""over 1000"" of the 1217 voices. You know, they say the sounds are ""derived"" from the XS... unless they're simply leaving out a number of the largest ones, maybe they are similar, and based on the same samples, but not quite the actual XS voices... i.e. maybe they are truncating samples (i.e. shorter attack portions before loops), or including fewer layers or more stretching, or employing some kind of compression... it will be interesting to see if it really sounds about the same as the other XS-based soundset models, or if it clearly doesn't sound quite as good.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=24907&sid=4b324f46c164f287e57edfc2f0530385#p24907

Though for me, a really big thing it's missing is MIDI control functionality. I was thinking it could be a great super-lightweight board especially if you could connect it to an iPad to fill in on a few areas where the XS soundset is weak... you know, you could run a clonewheel app on the iPad, or one of the nice VA synth programs, or the BS-16i sample player... but you can't effectively control these from the MX, you can't create presets that call up external sounds and split/layer them with internal ones like you can on a MOX.

I think its a little bit like the OASYS/M3/M50/KRONOS/KROME they all have different DACs so they sound ""slightly"" different, yet the fundamental sound is almost the same and there are some patches that exist on all of them, you play them side by side and they sound almost identical, with the OASYS being most HD and M50 being lower ""resolution"". I know this by experience, compared side by side OASYS, KRONOS and M50.Now Yamaha should be in the same ball park and the more expensive ones ""should"" have higher quality DACs so they should sound more pristine. sometimes, that lower quality is what makes it sound ""warmer"".Still, if you go for the physical appearance I can honestly tell you that the XF is definitely the best looking one.

I usually would suggest doing that via a second board, so you can also get the benefit of having both a weighted and unweighted action at your disposal (and with MIDI, you can always trigger sounds in either keyboard from either keybed)... but if someone wants to stick with one board, yes, this module looks great.

Not only does it give you real drawbars in something with more than 61 keys, but even more important, to me, is that it gives you a clonewheel with a bigger-than-61 keyboard for splits that includes a low E. From Nord, you can't get that without going to a fully weighted action that is less suitable for organ playing. The only other one I'm aware of is the Roland VR-700, which has a great feeling action, but the board is bulky and heavy. It would be nice to see a Nord Stage 2 with 88 keys (or close to it) without the hammer action. I like having more than 61 keys, but I definitely need that low E, and I also like the top key to be a C because that's most natural to me, especially for organ playing. I may consider this Hammond.

But the DX7 is great for playing split and layered presets.  From what i remember the DX7 was quite heavy compared to the D50 (about the same weight and the original DX7).  The DX7 has NO onboard FX but i don't think the D50 did either.

You could also quote the pro's of the Nord and the con's of the Kronos. But in the end, does any of it matter? I've read a few of those articles but I often don't even know what the numbers mean in a technical sense, let alone what they'd mean in a practical sense.The post on the Kronos contained a short review written by the guy who provided the samples for the Kronos analysis:anotherscott wrote:Maybe my expectations were too high... 4.7 gb, no loops, no stretching... but while not a terrible piano by any means, I actually found the Kronos piano to be disappointing. ... Dewster seems to be very sensitive to looping effects, so he would probably be more pleased with the Kronos than I am. But overall, between the hard attack and the thin sustain, I found the sound to be actually a bit reminiscent even of an old Yamaha CP-80. I do like the Kronos for many of its other features. But when I recently gigged with the Kronos and a Yamaha MOX8, I chose to use the MOX for my piano sound.Dewster is the guy analyzing those 'standardized' piano samples in a structured way and I have no doubt that his analysis is thorough and (as) fair (as possible). The nameanotherscottalso seems familiar.Anyway, put me behind a $115,000 Steinway Model D concert grand and an inspiring player outside with a $160 Yamaha NP11 and I'm sure people would leave to go listen to that awesome guy playing outside.It is the artist's skill, not the quality of the brush/instrument/camera, that fascinates.

On the technical side, obviously having 4.7GB of samples will allow the KRONOS to completely get rid of looping and vastly increase the number of velocity layers. ALL other hardware keys have to somehow reduce/model/recreate some aspects in order to make it fit without that amount of memory.The KRONOS German Grand certainly is a great sounding piano IMHO (just my 2 cents). As are some of the VSTi's out there. As are some recent hardware keyboards such as the Nord Piano, Kawai MP10 or the RD700NX(played from a different keybed) for instance in my very humble opinion.Technical Comparisons based on the very physics and accoustics are an interesting and useful tool to compare different instruments.

Since the new ""SuperNATURAL"" Rolands have no loops, comparing the loopless Kronos to an old looped Roland to make the point about how Kronos is better than Roland because it has no loops doesn't make sense, since the Roland mentioned above (RD700NX) has no loops either. Though personally, in real world playing, loops are often hard to hear, and a good quality looped piano can certainly sound better than an unlooped piano that may be inferior in other ways.And as it happens, I'm actually not the biggest fan of the Roland SuperNATURAL pianos either. To me, it's another example of something that's terrific on paper (no stretches, no looping, etc.), but to me just doesn't quite sound as much like a real piano as some of the ""technically inferior"" piano sounds from Nord, Kawai, and Yamaha.

Other settings are saved though.If you send MIDI directly to the MIDI channel configured for a section, it will always make sound; the NS2 doesn't check whether the section is enabled or not.

Sure, they can make some money with it, but will they really stick with the platform for the long term. I'd think that if users started to migrate to Android tablets in large numbers, they might just stop releasing new iPad apps and/or limit/stop support for them. I'm sure Apple is pretty pleased with the large number of iPad users who use it for making music, but I'm also convinced that they won't hesitate long making changes to the iPad (or more specifically its operating system, iOS) that turn it into a platform unsuitable for making music, if there is enough of a financial gain to do so. With each new OS release, they're turning my beloved 27"" iMac more and more into a 27"" iPad without a touchscreen - I'm sure I'll just install Windows 7 or even Linux on it if they keep going on like this.At least up to a few months ago (don't know what the current state is, I haven't kept myself up-to-date) there were serious technical issues with music applications on Android (latency) and Google wasn't going to fix this (doing so would cause other issues). While not all Android hardware was equally impacted by this (and it may be that newer Android versions made big improvements), I think the iPad is still more suitable (for music applications) because it has much lower latency.Personally I probably wouldn't buy an iPad just for use as a music-making tool, simply because I don't really see the firm commitment from vendors (both Apple as well as application vendors) for long-term support. That said, I like my iPad and use it quite a bit. Since I already had it, I bought quite a few music apps (such as Korg iElectribe, Yamaha TNR-i (Tenori-On for iPad), Sunrizer and Moog Animoog).Anyway, this is all just my speculation and opinion.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=25300&sid=91627fe37a670f7837df6037f1af1293#p25300

But in one of the OS upgrades (3-something or 4-something) they added CoreMIDI (low level MIDI OS support as in OS X), and then the barn doors were open. Android has no low level MIDI support. AFAIK, this affects all Android hardware.  If it's not done at the OS level, there's not much a developer can do, because he can't get enough control over I/O timing. Certain kinds of apps might be okay, if they are not time-dependent (say, an editor/librarian or patch selector), but anything that depends on real-time I/O with external MIDI gear is basically unworkable. Since Apple's iOS is derived from OS X which had MIDI support, the infrastructure was already there for them to draw on.

The internals of Android do not support real time MIDI I/O (there's no equivalent there to Apple's CoreMIDI infrastructure). That's why the apps aren't there. Developers are not given the tools to have sufficient control over the  timing of the MIDI data stream. It's not even a matter of ""latency"" per se, its worse. It's not like each note would come out 25 ms late., but rather one note may come out 5 ms late and the next note may come out 50 ms late. (Numbers for illustrative purposes only.) At least this is my understanding.Basically, an app could tell the Android OS to send out a MIDI command, but it can't tell it exactly when... and then the OS will send the data whenever it gets around to it, amid all the other background processes that it is doing all the time. Normally, a user doesn't care if something happens ""now"" or 50 ms from now, so it's not an issue that the OS doesn't give apps such fine control over time... but with MIDI, it's essential. So you need to have that support at the OS level for real-time MIDI apps to work.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=25319&sid=91627fe37a670f7837df6037f1af1293#p25319

Why is this important you might think? Well, I was also going to buy hardware to work with the iPad (an Alesis io dock) so that I can easily connect my audio equipment. As far as I am aware the new lightining connector is not compatible with most existing 3rd party iPad hardware unless you have an adapter and, in many cases (including the Alesis io dock) I am not convinced that an adapter would work for hardware where the iPad is designed to fit within it.The impact of Apple's decision is very significant and could put a lot of small/medium sized companies specialising in third-party compatible hardware at risk as, in many, cases they will have to re-design their products for use with the new Ipad in order to carry on selling those products.Whilst I am sure that Apple have their reasons for making the change, I am not sure they have appreciated or grasped the short to medium term consequences of their actions and could require existing owners to have to upgrade third party hardware when they also change their Ipad to 4th gen+.This of course could well play in to the hands of rival companies such as Windows if they can get their act together and start releasing the sort of quality music apps that we have seen on the iPad and can get third parties to supply hardware.

The thing is fully analog, has lots of options, can be integrated into a setup using CV (usually modular synth modules) yet still has both MIDI and USB in-/outputs. Be aware that is a monophonic synth, so if you wanted to compare it to a Dave Smith, compare it to the regular Mopho. You do not have any way of saving sounds (other than writing down the settings), so it will force you to get good at quickly creating your own sounds.The fact it does not have any way of saving sounds might be a reason to stay away from it. Most modern synths (like the Mopho/Mopho X4/Prophet '08) are more refined and do include stuff like saving sounds.If synth modules are okay with you (so no keyboard, you could use the extern sections of the NS2) the following might be interesting too:- Moog Minitaur- Moog Slim PhattyI didn't include any of the module versions of the DSI synths (Mopho, Tetra, Prophet '08, Evolver), since with the exception of the Prophet '08 you'd really need to use an editor on your PC to quickly create your own sounds.Of course, you can also use a softsynth.

I have a Mopho and it is relatively simple to switch programs on the nord and have it tell the mopho via midi to switch to a specific patch (although it only works with bank A and the first 99 patches). So if you are using it live, that is a huge plus.Another thing the mopho has going on for it is the sequencer. Since you have two keyboard you could find yourself in need of a sequenced bass, or arpegios or just holding a pad while actually playing another less repetitive thing. So the Mopho is quite handy if that could be the case.I have heard the MiniBrute and I was somewhat impressed, but the smaller keyboard and lack of patch memory is enough reason to go with the mopho instead (in any of its versions).Still which one sounds better depends on your style, but as a general opinion, I think the Mopho is much more versatile.Saludos,Gustavo",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=25014&sid=91627fe37a670f7837df6037f1af1293#p25014

Maybe get something like the MicroKorg XL+ (which isn't available yet in the USA), looks very nice. M1 sounds, KORG EPs (which some seem to favor over ours) and of course, their great MMT engine. It also has an excellent vocoder. Downsides: does not have step sequencer and the arpeggiator is somewhat limited. If you want splits or layers, its only Bitimbral, meaning only 2 sounds maximum at once. If having a vocoder is not important, then you might even go get a microstation or the new Krome. Perhaps even a Yamaha MOX 6.My other recommendation is getting a Tetra. Sure, it may not be so easy to edit due to the limited interface but if you are somewhat familiar with subtractive synthesis, its quite straight forward. There is also a PC/MAC editor. The best thing about the Tetra that you lack on the Mopho x4 is four-part multitimbrality. That means you could have 1 4-voice sounds, 2-voice+2-voice, 1-voice+3voice, or any combination. Even have each as a single voice. Also to note is that each one has its own sequencer, which may prove useful. So for layers/splits that is hard to beat.Also, avoid the new novation synths. Vocoder sucks and the sound is so-so. Plus, they are monotimbral.Saludos,Gustavo",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=25054&sid=91627fe37a670f7837df6037f1af1293#p25054

There are pros and cons, but compared to a (presumably weighted) Stage 2, the combination of the E3HP+Wave will be easier to carry around and it will give you access to both a weighted and an unweighted action. As for the Wave vs. Lead, I'd go with the Wave. The Lead has some synth advantages, but the Wave is still very strong there (and also stronger than the NS2), and I think you'd benefit more from having access to the sample library, which the Lead doesn't have.

I recently tried to replaced my Yamaha S90ES and Electro 3 with a Stage 2.  Although I really like the Stage 2, I almost immediately came to the conclusion that I still needed a second keyboard, so I got a Yamaha MOX6.  One reason was to have an unweighted keyboard to drive the Stage 2 organ.  But the bigger reason is that there are certain areas where the Nord sample library is very weak.  For example, I use a lot of bass and guitar sounds when I play in my duo.  The Nord library has almost no guitars and the basses are sub-par compared with those available on most of the current crop of ROMplers.  (As a test, go to a store and listen to the Acoustic Bass on the Nord and the ""Velo Growl"" bass on any of the Yamaha XS line of synths (XS, XF, MOX).....it's not even close.  The yamaha is so much more expressive.)The good news is that you can evaluate this for yourself because you can try out the samples on your Electro.  If you find that the library is missing sounds that you need, then buying the Stage 2 (or Wave for that matter) is not going to help from that perspective.  Let's put it this way:  You could add a MOX6 or Korg Krome to your Electro HP and the combination it is still cheaper (and arguably more flexible) than a Stage 2.On the other hand, if you are more interested in pure synthesis stuff than ROMpler sounds there are other options in addition to the Wave: (Mopho x4, Novation Ultra, etc.)",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=25161&sid=91627fe37a670f7837df6037f1af1293#p25161

Ableton cannot handle MIDI SysEx messages and because of this, you can't include SysEx dumps of programs in your MIDI files (not that this works with new synths, but that's a different matter). Ableton Live makes more sense to me than Logic, but I suppose that Logic might be better for mixing/producing stuff while Live might be better for live setups.Tinpig wrote:What were the filters like on the Virus? I really like the filters on the Stage 2 - they are somehow warm and give an aura of quality and I imagine the Wave would be very similar in this regard.Well, the filters on the Virus aren't creamy smooth like a Moog. You have lets of different filter options, but in general they can sound somewhat harsh and digital. That said, I like the Waldorf filters (especially the comb filter) a lot and those sound even more digital. I would guess you can mimic the sound of the Stage 2's filter on the Virus, but I'm not sure nor have I tried it.I thought the filter on the Stage 2 sounded better than the Wave's, but it might just be exactly the same filter.Tinpig wrote:The filters are the only thing that dissappoints me about my KS5 in terms of the overall quality of the sound produced. Other than that its a very capable little rig for only £450 and I would be sad to see it go.Well, whatever you do, don't trade it in for an Ultranova then. While the thing works fine (and the filter undoubtedly works better than on the older Novation synths), it somehow fails the impress (the sound). Maybe I should toss it on ebay and get an older Supernova II.Tinpig wrote:Clearly given the price being asked for the Wave and Virus (they are only about £200 apart in the market), the Virus seems to offer more capabilities for the money.A second-hand Virus TI (or TI2) might be an option. You can probably easily find units in excellent condition for maybe 50% of the price of a new TI2. The TI and TI2 still run the same software; the TI2 has 2-3 more knobs and gets about 25% more polyphony than the TI.Tinpig wrote:It is a shame that Youtube is littered only with audio examples of a Virus at its most extreme. I like to produce more subtle nuances in my sound to go with my Stage 2 - can the Virus do 'soft'.It can do 'soft', but don't look at the (tons) of presets that come with the thing. That's mostly trance-type stuff, laden in effects. (Effects is something the Virus does very well and it has lots and lots of them.)The oscillators on the Virus (starting with the Virus A) would alias pretty badly in the higher registers, which made for a pretty raw and digital sound. On the Virus TI they added a lot of new oscillator types; the old ones are still there (they're called 'classic' now, I think) but the newer ones don't alias like that (they sound smoother). You can choose if you run the Virus at 44.1 or 48 KHz and by running at 48 KHz, you can increase the frequency at which the aliasing occurs and move some of that crap higher in the frequency band (where you might not be able to hear it). Anyway, I think they left in those aliasing oscillators, because it's part of that 'classic' Virus sound. A lot of virtual-analogs have issues with aliasing oscillators, but in a lot of cases they've intentionally left in oscillators that alias (in addition to ones that don't) - the Kurzweil synths (with their amazingly deep and hard to program synth-architecture) are an example of this.This sounds pretty nice:[youtube][/youtube]Granted, there's a version with a Moog Little Phatty and that does manage to sound more like a CS80Tinpig wrote:I think i really need to try out the Virus TI2 to make sure its the right board for me.Maybe you know someone who has one and will let you borrow it for a few days? Like the Nords it is a really knobby synth and there's hardly any menu-diving involved but it does have lots of buttons, features and effects and is certainly quite a bit more difficult to use than a Nord. I think you either love or hate it and that goes for both the sound and the interface. For what it does, the Virus is rather expensive (as are the Nords). You can pretty much get the same sounds out of soft-synths (as with the Nords), but personally I prefer knobs over a mouse. The Waldorf Blofeld can also sound quite a bit like the Virus, but the hardware (and software) quality of modern Waldorf synths can't really compete with the Virus; then again, it costs 4-6x less. The Virus certainly has a better user-interface than the Blofeld and I'd say it is also easier to program. The (PC) software for the Virus was pretty crappy and unstable in the past, but then I'm talking about years ago. I never had any crashes or hangs (I did with the Blofeld).While the Virus can input and output audio via USB, there are some issues. It has issues with some USB chipsets and it does not like it when it shares a USB port with other devices - the sound will 'stutter' if you run in to this. The software that comes with the Virus checks for this and warns you about this, if it detects issues (on a Mac this is less of a problem). For the best sound quality you should use the regular outputs; the thing has very good AD and DA convertors. Of course, the Wave doesn't even output sound via USB, so I suppose that would just be a nice bonus on the Virus.Edit: this one has some interesting sounds and it also shows the interface.[youtube][/youtube]",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=24922&sid=91627fe37a670f7837df6037f1af1293#p24922

That 64-note polyphony for the PC3LE is the maximum, it will often be 32 or 16 (or even lower). This is not Kurzweil specific, you pretty much see it on most (complex DSP-based) synthesizers. An example of where this is very visible is the Virus TI - with simple sounds it reaches around 90-note polyphony on a Virus TI2 but as sounds get more complex (and/or you add effects, of which the Virus TI has loads and loads) a single sounds will require more DSP 'power' and the polyphony will go down rapidly.As you might see I'm fairly enthusiastic about the Kurzweil PC3 series. This is probably the workstation that allows you the most control when creating your own sounds. The downside is that it can be rather complex and (in the case of the PC3) you cannot use your own samples for these sounds (you can on the PC3K or the older PC2600/PC2500 with the right expansions). The PC3 is also a very capable MIDI controller, allowing for lots of splits, etc.Back to your question:I think pretty much all 'workstations' (and very complex DSP-based synths like the Virus) dynamically allocate resources. Nord is a bit different in this respect, as for example the Wave is 18-note polyphonic (no matter which sounds or effects you use). This means that in some cases you might have DSP resources not being used and another vendor might've decided to allow you to use these and might've sold something like the Wave as 18-30 note polyphonic.I'm oversimplifying a bit here though; I think the internal structure of the Nord instruments is more fixed than say with a Virus and does not lend itself as easy for dynamically assigning these resources. This does make the instruments more predictable though. On the Stage 2 they specify 40-60 note polyphony (I hope these numbers are correct) for the piano section and a fixed 20 note polyphony for the synth section.Right, enough bla bla",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=19142&sid=91627fe37a670f7837df6037f1af1293#p19142

What lowers polyphony on any kind of ""rompler"" (regardless of Korg/Yamaha/Kurz origin) is how many samples are being triggered at once. If a board has 64 note polphony, that doesn't mean you can play 64 notes at once, it means you can trigger 64 samples at once, and that's not the same thing. For example, on a stereo piano sound, a single keypress includes at least two samples, left and right. If they are doing sample cross-fading around a certain velocity where you are playing, then that could be four samples. If you're layering a string sound, that can be one or more additional samples. If the piano patch includes string resonance or pedal noise effects, those could be additional samples. Add all that up, and the first piano note you play could be using 8 notes of polyphony! Despite that scary figure, in the real world, I have very rarely heard a stolen note in live performance of a board with ""only"" 64 note polyphony.To get back to the original question, my understanding is that splits don't matter. If you have 64 note polyphony, it will be dynamically allocated, not split 32/32. Until you hit 64 total, it shouldn't steal anything from anywhere. 64 and 0 should be fine.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=21035&sid=91627fe37a670f7837df6037f1af1293#p21035

I’ve been on line to the various keyboard forums, spent hours on the Sweetwater (and You-tube) web pages watching videos and sound clips, and now I need to make a decision and make a purchase.But I need some help from my fellow musicians.  I've read many posts and opinions on the Nord Users Forum, but I can’t decide on which rig I want to go with, and this is an expensive decision, and if you don’t mind, I would really appreciate some input.  Before I present to you my three heavily scrutinized options and ask for your help, I would like to give you two more bits of information, if I could so impose on your time and expertise.1)  In my jazz/blues quintet, there is Keyboards (myself), drums, bass, and 2 saxophone players, one who doubles on guitar part of the time.  With this particular set-up as the keyboard player, I provide almost the entire harmonic makeup of the group.  This is a highly experienced group, and therefore, I need the best 2 keyboard option available that will provide:a)  The finest acoustic piano sounds known to the music world.b)  Outstanding electric piano soundsc)  Fantastic Hammond B3 emulationsd)  A wide variety of fat sounding synthesis including synth leads, pads, brass, and arpeggiator options.2)  At 51 years of age and at this point in my life, I want the best available, and I want timeless instruments, something that won’t be out dated or antiquated in three years, instruments that will last for the next ten years. I've saved the $$, price not an issue.With these two considerations, I have narrowed down my list to the following three options:Option #1Top Keyboard		Korg 	Kronos X-73Bottom Keyboard		Yamaha	CP-1 Stage PianoOption #2Top Keyboard		Nord 	Stage 2-88Bottom Keyboard		Korg 	Kronos X-88Option #3Left Keyboard		Yamaha	CP-1 Stage PianoRight Keyboard (Top)	                Nord 	C2D OrganRight Keyboard (Bottom) 	Roland	Jupiter 80(The right keyboards will be at a 45% angle to the left keyboard on option #3)I have eliminated the following keyboards either by playing at the local guitar centers, or by listening to and watching countless You-Tube videos:Not in ContentionRoland Fantom GPiano sounds average, organ sounds suck, synth stuff – OK, too menu driven, doesn’t meet criterion 2 above, this ax is already outdated - 700 of the sounds will never be used.Yamaha Motif XFPiano sounds are too similar to the CP1, but not as good.  Organs suck even worse than Roland, good orchestral stuff, but lacks in the synth department, too menu driven, but not as bad as the Fantom in that there are individual buttons for the various instrumental groups.  Great guitars, but I don’t use guitars.  Average arpeggiator options, and again, too many unusable sounds to the working/performing musician.Roland V-PianoToo damned expensive, period, and too heavy (80 lbs.).Kurzweil PC3K 88Nice, but for me it took 2nd place to the Kronos.  Electric pianos suck, very good orchestral, average organs, above average acoustic pianos.  This ax doesn’t give me that “Wow” factor.Additional ConsiderationsKurzweil K-3000Will there be a K-3000? And if so, how long before the release?  	And will this be good enough to put off buying the new Kronos X88?Fantom VWill there be a new Fantom V in the near future?  And will it include V-piano and V-synth sound sets which would cause one to postpone buying the new Kronos X88?Reasoning for Option 1The CP1 in my opinion is the finest sounding stage piano available, a timeless purchase that will last for years without becoming outdated in three years.  And as a jazz pianist, a beautifully crafted, balanced and useable instrument.  Matched with the new Kronos X which provides fantastic synth stuff, a very good Korg C3 organ, and unparalleled arpeggiator options as well as excellent pianos, seems to offer the perfect complement to the CP1.Reasoning for Option 2The versatility of the Nord Stage 2 on top of the Kronos X seems to be a match made in heaven.  The Nord offers instant knob tweak-ability that the other boards don’t offer, and it has killer organs and very good pianos.  The synth stuff only seems average, but the versatility and goodness of sound outweigh the negatives.  However, will these piano sound sets be inferior in comparison to the CP1?Reasoning for Option 3This combination covers every parameter that I mention on my both of my first and second criteria.  However, it is three boards to pack to gigs instead of two boards, and this option is $3000 more expensive.  And can the Kronos organs match-up to the Nord C2D?PLEASE HELP, THIS IS A DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE DECISION, YOUR TIME AND EXPERTISE IN THIS MATTER IS VERY MUCH APPREICIATED, AND I WILL BUY THESE PRODUCTS FROM SWEETWATER.Thank YouGlenn P.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=20574&sid=91627fe37a670f7837df6037f1af1293#p20574

As for my 2 cents, two things come to my mind: #2 seems a bit odd since you have both 88 weighted keys boards. Why not take the smaller version of either of the two boards to have more adequate Organ/Synth Keys? MIDIes up you can anyhow play either sound from either board. Secondly, I think your basic question is the quest for the (subjectively, obviously) BEST Piano sound (And even though you don't mention it, probably also the action). IMHO, given that this is really subjective, after all it will depend on your personal preferences. The Kronos, NS2, and the CP-1 all have very good piano sounds but are also rather different, including the action. But given you buy anyhow two boards just need to eliminate one. Given you need a very versatile Synth on top, The NS2 and CP1 would rival for the Piano parts only. I would defintiively spend some time to play both in a store to get your PERSONAL favorite. Finally, as you also look for Organ, question si whether you need two manuals and/or drawbars. The NS2 (different from the CP) would at least give you an additional decent clonewheel sound plus drawbuttons.Anyhow, I personally would probably go for #1 or #2 (with Kronos 73), depending on what my preferences in terms of Piano Sound and Action are(in fact, I would take a NP2-88 as weighted board since its my preferred Piano Action/Sound Combo, but thats another story).Cheers, Johannes",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=20580&sid=91627fe37a670f7837df6037f1af1293#p20580

A perfect choice of brands to be honest......Just before I go into it. Why didn't you consider a bottom keyboard (NS2 88 preferrably) and as top keyboard a midi keyboard with a Macbook Pro attached to it? The Macbook provides you with far more flexibility, control and quality to your sounds. The Korg would have been my priority too but it can't compete to the wide range of superb plugins that are available for Mac/Win. And the Korg sounds get out of date while the plugins can be renewed/updated (at relatively low costs).Another convenient aspect is the weight. The NS2 88 is not so heavy comparing to Kronos X88 and Yamaha CP1. Combine that with a midi keyboard (Novation SL MKII for example) on top and your back will be thankfull.I would definitely go for an NS2 88. Ofcourse, it will always be a matter of taste and there are lots off topics on this forum regarding the piano sounds, but the Nord piano is my favourite of all. I absolutely love Yamaha but the natural sound of the Nord makes my heart melt every time haha!And when you use the NS2 88 as your main keyboard you always have the best piano, EP and organ sounds with you. And it's synth is ok just for small gigs or rehearsals (although there are some pretty cool sounds in it which are really good for a ""stage piano"").One more thing, I wouldn't go for option #3 unless you have a personal roadie. I know, it looks great, it sounds great, it impresses everybody but it is just too much to carry with you haha! I'm playing in bands for almost 14 years now (I'm 29) and throughout the years I'm beginning to hate all the carrying of the heavy gear. So, make your gear full scoped and at the highest quality but keep it as light as possible.

It is just so heavy and does not sound that better. But the Kawai MP-10, that one totally blew me away!! Plus I felt that the keybed is more like a real piano (I actually got a Kawai grand recently). I mention it because it seems to be the same concept as the CP-1, which is awesome Pianos with a real piano action, which might interest you.Still since you do not have roadies, I would go solely for a Nord Stage 2 88. Sure the Kronos will delivery extra sounds, but from what you mention, I do not think that it is worth spending so much on the Kronos (that much also includes all the time spent setting it up, carrying an extra keyboard, etc.). I believe you could get all the sounds you want from the Nord Stage 2. Also, personally I think the keybed on the NS2 88 is better for pianos, which provides a better experience in those cases, but it is still good enough to play organs. I think that on EPs, both are probably tied, but I find the Nord Stage 2 to have a more intuitive interface which is more tweakable. But in exchange for that you do not get a lot of bread and butter sounds, on the Kronos you could just dial in a patch that has a name similar to what you want and play. On the Nord Stage 2 you'll find yourself dialing in an EP and putting the effects as you feel sounds best. Two very different approaches.So that may be a very rough way of putting things, but that is how I see them. If you are going to be playing jazz and do not need sequencing, drum tracks, complex orchestral samples or complex synth tones, then I'd go with a Nord Stage 2 88. THEN if I am not satisfied in one regard I'd get something to expand. If you need better synth sounds, I'd get a Tetra instead (true analog and much cheaper/compact/light).Also, if you are going for NS2+Kronos from the start, I would get the 88 NS2 and a 61 Kronos, just to keep things simpler.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=20640&sid=91627fe37a670f7837df6037f1af1293#p20640

I'm not playing a real piano, or a real organ, so with that constraint, is the sound good enough for 99.9% of my audience? I have to haul this out and back in upwards of every week, and sometimes more than once in a weekend (which is a lot for an amateur like me), and my back for some reason is not getting better at handling the weight, so is it the lightest I can make it? I play a lot of improv and when a clav with wah is the perfect thing for what we've stumbled into, can I get to it with just a few quick button pushes?  The room is eating up my tone, can I tweak the EQ on the fly to carry further?  A gentle phase would sound good to animate this Rhodes patch, can I get it applied within a second?  The Nord, for me, answers all of these questions with a resounding yes.  Some bands I play with I need the same tweakability and depth in a synth, and I bring out my Moog for that, but otherwise the Stage 2 does everything I could hope for.  I add stompboxes here and there to add flexibility to certain effects, but I'd apply those to any keyboard I'd own, so I don't count that as a hit against the Nord.  It's my 95% solution, and I add a few things to get it to 99% (100% would be a real Hammond and Rhodes and Clav, which ain't happening ever).But my opinion is not as valuable as the rest in here because I would never consider a Kronos just because it's waaaaaaaaaaay too much board for my needs.

The Kronos does not have a hard drive, it has an SSD drive. It serves the same kind of function, but the technology of the mechanism is entirely different (essentially a kind of flash memory). I suspect that warning was written for the OASYS (the Kronos' predecessor, which had a hard drive), and when most of the OASYS manual was adapted to the Kronos, that warning came along unnecessarily. One of the advantages of SSD drives over hard drives is that they don't have the kinds of temperature issues that hard drives do.

That said, when I went to see Herbie Hancock a while ago, he had a Korg Oasys, a baby grand and three iMacs on stage.I'm under the impression that a lot of acts that very clearly use laptops on stage use software like Ableton Live or Traktor and controllers like the Akai APC40, Novation Launchpad or Tractor Kontrol S4.

Very good comments! Much appreciated! However, it can get as complex as you want to. Structure and overview is very important to me. So I only use the software and plugins I really use like Logic, Mainstage, Kontakt and some other plugins (for strings and brass mainly).I get your three last points but I don't agree. This setup gives access to more possibilities in a great user friendly interface. It is far more likely that you will make a great track on an MBP than on the Kronos (with its thousands of menus and submenus on a small screen). That is also one of the main cons of the Kronos, it is just too much that you won't use and that can't compete with Cubase, Ableton and/or Logic. Maybe I should include in my first post that it is not only for use on stage but also for homerecording.With respect to the buying of more sounds, updates and plugins I don't see an issue there as long as you keep it under control.

Also if you are only interested in pianos, you could look into the Nord Piano 2, it looks great.To me, the Nord pianos are like a real piano: it works, sounds great and you do not need to tweak it. Maybe you have to add some EQ, but I find them really realistic and much better than other keyboards. Sure others can manipulate the piano sound and change it. But I prefer a more realistic approach: in ""real life"" you got 1 gran piano and that´s it.  Still I have never used softsynths so I cannot give a real opinion.But why are you also considering the C2? It does not have a piano sound. So you got to weigh if you reaaaaaly need a realistic Hammond sound, get the C2. If you need Hammnod + Piano get a Nord Stage 2.

The Vintage D has excellent recordings of a beautiful instrument and they did a decent job on the programming, too. I use it in Kontakt 5, don't know if it works with the free KontaktPlayer. If you already have a proper computer/keyboard/audio interface, the Vintage D will be a worthwhile addition for the money.That said, since I got the NP88, I don't use the Vintage D anymore. I think Clavia conclusively proves that size doesn't matter, its 80MB Grand Lady D sample blows away the multi-GB virtual pianos I know (I reserve judgement until I have actually played the EWQL and Vienna Imperial). Pure sound quality is only a part of the story, it is how you connect with the instrument. The NP88 delivers in spades, very much a ""just-power-up-and play"" thing, as opposed to virtual pianos where I always feel the need to tweak the parameters or edit the MIDI parts to get it right.In fact, I like the GrandLadyD so much that most of the time I don't even bother with MIDI, I just record straight to audio. It's not perfect, it has flaws like uneven volumes for certain notes, but as a complete instrument it can't be beat.

Since the Studiologic one has a graded action, it might not make that much sense if you split the keyboard. On the other hand, it might feel a bit more like a real piano even though neither one simulates escapement.As a controller, I would think that the M-Audio is better. It has more controllers and M-Audio's HyperControl software should allow it to integrate into a DAW without having to manually map controllers or load mappings.If you're after a capable controller and want to play synths and organs and/or use splits, the M-Audio might be the right choice. If you will mainly play piano's, the Studiologic might feel better. It would of course be best if you can try them both to check which one feels best to you.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=16548&sid=91627fe37a670f7837df6037f1af1293#p16548

I've owned both, and presently I still have the Studiologic VMK188plus. As far as keyboard feel, it's hard to beat the St, whereas the KS has keys that sometimes offer a lot of resistance, almost like they're stuck, then they release as you're pushing down, and what comes out is too loud. And everything is inconsistent, so it's impossible to play sensitively.However, M-Audio has absolutely great software, and the Fatar/Studiologic stuff tends to be buggy. So it's all a tradeoff. My suggestion is to try both, paying attention to the consistency of the velocity levels with different playing. The St has sometimes had issues with out of spec velocity levels, so you'd want to get a good one. Each keyboard has it's issues, so I'd read reviews wherever i could find them, including Harmony Central, Amazon, etc. I hope this helps.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=18226&sid=91627fe37a670f7837df6037f1af1293#p18226

It is not hard, some may say it even has little resistance, but I found it very responsive. Of them all I found that to be the most inspiring keybed due to the easyness of playing (you are not fighting the action). The only keybed I found better was the Mp-10´s, which seems to have a full piano mechanism inside. Downside is that the thing is damn big and heavy, sort of the Big Yamaha CP keyboards.I tried out the organ on all other ones, and I found none of them to be as good. I think that the Korg´s CX3 engine on the OASYS and KRONOs was definitely great. But it sounded too ""bright"" for me. At least on the presets. But that means that to get a very realistic B3 you have to do some editing, which does not happen on the NS2, you got a great organ from the start.The biggest surprise to me was the Trident. I did not expect to ever see one in person. Let alone play one. It was not fully functional but the ""String"" section worked. And it worked wonders. It was sort of ""leaking"" in sound, but it was so damn good. I just cannot describe it.Then the OASYS. That is true HD sound. You can just hear the difference in the AD converters, they are simply top of the line, pristine. But to my surprise the M50 actually DOES sound like an OASYS!! sure the OASYS does things the M50 can´t, but even some presets are almost the same, which makes it sound even closer. In spite of the OASYS being better looking the real beast seemed to be the KRONOS, I think it was truly a step ahead for KORG. I cannot say the sound is better, but boy it does sound good. Some of the orchestral patches and acoustics are simply wonderful. The Pianos I think do rival the Nord´s, but the C2 engine is better than the CX3. And the rhodes, I do not know why people say that Nords are not good. to my ears, they are equal. But I felt that the SV-1 was definitely inferior in every aspect, even EPs. Maybe it was just the keybed.Then came the Motif XF. After the very logical and easy approach of the Korgs, I found the Motif to be even cryptical at times and I struggled a bit to actually get it to do what I wanted. On the User interface side, this is probably the worst of the top keyboards (well, I have not tried Kurzweil). Compared to even the Nords one velocity layer samples, I found the sound to be somewhat of inferior quality. I do not know if that is linked to the fact that it was the 61 key version, but the NS2 felt of higher quality overall. I know everybody praised the Yamahas for their acoustic sounds but now adays I think Korg is definitely ahead in every single aspect. Specially the full orchestral sounds, I found the Motif ones to be uninspiring. Maybe I was expecting too much and got disappointed. NS2 has better pianos. Way better.Afterwards, I tried the Juno Stage.. Man such a different league! it feels so cheap, the sounds are very GENERAL-MIDI like compared to the top notch workstations. I have seen people try to compare that one to the Nord Stage, specially because fo the price difference. But the Juno is IMO extremely inferior to the NS2. only good things about it is the audio routing possibilites, which do work and seems like its going to be useful to someone.Then I tried the Kawai MP-10. The piano and EP sounds were fantastic, they definitely impressed me. It has a very limited sonic range, but the few sounds it has are extremely good. Just like the Nord Stage.So that´s my story. If you have any specific questions as to how what compares to what feel free to ask them. I hope that after spending 1 hr on each, I can answer any doubt.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=18382&sid=91627fe37a670f7837df6037f1af1293#p18382

This was actually over 2 days because I leave school at 12 and they close at 18, so since I spent so much time with each keyboard I had to go back another day. But the guy Steff was really nice, very cool person. We started talking keyboards and all of the sudden he goes: ""you know we have an OASYS, its in this special room no one is allowed to enter."" There was a Prophet V I played, but it was not in optimal conditions. An Oberheim 4-voice, a Polymoog, an unnamed Korg that sounded very weird, the Trident and the OASYS. Oh and they had a PPG in its original box as well as a SC Prophet 600 in its box. No one knows if those two are functional because they do not dare opening the boxes!!Well the Juno Stage was ok. The piano sound was good, but somewhat not realistic. It seemed more of a ""perfect, ideal"" piano to me than a real one. To me, everything was ok. It has some cool features (MIC in, midi/sound player from USB stick) but somehow it just did not stand out sonically like the M50 did to me. In my opinion the best budget keyboard is still the M50, even after MOX´s arrival. I think that the pianos are better on the MOX, but the M50 is so much better at the UI, synth, COMBI, editing and the brass/orchestral sounds of the M50 are not that far behind.Well I did experience GAS, I bought a Kaossilator 2 and a Monotribe. I tried out both, and the KO2 was simply too much fun (although is just good for dance music, but very good) and the monotribe has a huge beautiful sound.But buying those was more of an impulse and a ""thank you"" for letting me be there for like 9 hours! I also wanted to buy a KRONOs 61 and that sexy Trident. Unfortunately even though I have the money RIGHT NOW, I cannot bring it back. I live regularly in Mexico and I am right now in Stuttgart, Germany. I am living here for 2 months. I just cannot justify bringing the KRONOS, let alone the huge and heavy Trident. The only thing I want to try out and could not was a Waldorf Blofeld. Unfortunately when I got there the last blofeld was sold the previous day and who knows when the next one will arrive.BTW the store´s name is Sound of Music, located in Olgastr. , Stuttgart, Germany.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=18391&sid=91627fe37a670f7837df6037f1af1293#p18391

You can recreate some sounds (like bells, etc.) but not convincing pianos, etc. For stuff like pianos and organs a Stage or Electro would be best. However, the Electro does not have a built-in synthesizer though it can play sampled sounds, so you could sample a synthesizer sound and use that. The Stage does have a synthesizer; on the original Stage it is like a Lead 2X with less features, on the Stage 2 it is like a Wave with less features.If you like tweaking sounds (especially while playing), the Electro is not a good choice. If the synthesizer part is very important to you, the Nord Wave might be a better choice than the Stage. It has a much more capable synthesizer than the Stage and is able to create most of the sounds the Lead 2X can. Additionally, it can use samples as a sound source which you can 'sculpt' with filters, LFOs, etc. You could think of the Wave as the 'Nord Lead 4'. You can put natural sounds on the Wave (via samples), but you only have one velocity layer and you cannot select a different sample based on the speed with which you hit a key (like you can on a Roland Fantom, Yamaha Motif or Korg M3/Kronos). You can of course change the volume, filter, etc. based on velocity so for some sounds this is not a limitation.To sum it up: if the synthesizer part is most important to you, you might be best served with a Nord Wave. If instruments like pianos, organs, etc. are most important but you also want a synth section that you can tweak in realtime the Stage 2 (or a second hand Stage, though that is more limited and cannot use samples) would be a better choice. If you only play a single instrument at the same time and you don't need to tweak (synths) sounds in realtime (you can tweak piano/organ sounds) an Electro 3 might be an option, though it is more limited than the Wave/Stage 2.The Wave is bi-timbral (so can make two different sounds at the same time) with up to 18 voices. The Stage 2 can make 2 organ, 2 piano (or rhodes/wurlitzer) and 2 synth sounds at the same time; I don't know what the limit on the number of voices is though, probably something like 20 voices (in total) for the synth section.Pleases not that while the more recent Nords like the Electro 3, Stage 2, Wave and even the Piano 2 can use samples, they are not samplers (like the Roland/Yamaha/Korg alternatives mentioned). You create a sound on your PC using the Nord editor software and you then upload it to your instrument. Nord has quite an extensive library of piano and sample sounds which can be downloaded free of charge.As for the Lead 2X: if you looking for a virtual analog synth the Lead might be the best choice. Clavia (Nord) pretty much started the virtual analog business and the fact they are still selling a product directly based on that initial offering is a testament to the (sound) quality of their original Nord Lead. When looking purely at (virtual) analog: the Lead 2X has 4 slots and 20 voices, the Wave 2 slots and 18 voices. The Wave has built-in effects like reverb, the Lead 2X does not.If you want to get an idea of the sound of the Lead 2X, you could try the demo version of DiscoDSP Discovery. This is a (commercial) software recreation of the Lead as a VST instrument for the Mac and PC. The sound is not exactly the same, but very very similar. It can load the same instrument descriptions (programs) as the Lead 2X and the control panel is also almost identical to the Lead 2X. You can find this demo version here:http://www.discodsp.com/discovery/",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=17797&sid=91627fe37a670f7837df6037f1af1293#p17797

(Kind of like what Nord does with their free downloadable sample library, Korg provides more sounds than can possibly fit in memory at once, so you don't necessarily hear all its best sounds out of the box... though unlike Nord, it doesn't take much time to unload some sounds and load in others, and you don't need to hook up a computer to do it.

The Kronos ""rompler"" engine is very much like the M3. The Kronos adds separate dedicated engines for piano, EP, FM synth, assorted VA synth, clonewheel organ, etc., but for the things you're talking about, those extra engines won't make a difference (except maybe for some new kinds of pads from the other engines). I think that, in general, natural acoustic instruments is an area where Yamaha tends to excel.The other suggestions here have also been good... Instead of the Roland Jupiter 80, you could also look at the forthcoming Jupiter 50 which has all the same sounds. And instead of the Kurzweil PC3K8, you could look at anything in the PC3 line, which will also have pretty much all the same sounds. The K series mostly adds 128 mb of user fillable sample RAM. If you don't need that, you may still find some non-K versions at lower cost (PC361, PC3, PC3X), or the slightly scaled down models that still have the same sound set (PC3LE 6, 7, and 8).Part of this is also related to which Nord you get, since you probably want to end up with one weighted action and one non.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=16433&sid=91627fe37a670f7837df6037f1af1293#p16433

I was going to go for a 2nd full 88 - and looked at the Stage 2 for that. My first board is a Motif 8 - one of the 2nd generation ES series with a LAN card and 1 gig ram. However, I looked at the Stage 2 88 and thought I really needed something more portable - like the compact 73. However, then I just wasn't happy. My real bind wasn't the pianos or the action. The Yamaha gave me everything I needed for the pianos, and great action - it was the organs I was having an issue with - and I thought the compact 73 with the lighter touch and the organs would solve that. It didn't. I went with a Hammond XK3C, and with the MIDI smarts of the unit, began using the bottom manual as a controller for virtual instruments off of my Mac. Then the synth quandry. Again - it was back to the Nord for the solution, and I looked at the Wave as a possible replacement for an old PPG 2.6. I just didn't like the Lead - but loved the Mellotron stuff. But, I played an Access Virus TI2 - which is so perfect, that it made the choice obvious.I bought a Virus. Then the 3rd quandry - I now had/have 3 great keyboards, but I just want one to take with me when I drop in to play whether it's here in San Francisco, or visiting. Again - back to the Nord Stage 2 Compact - which should solve those issues - but it's the same price as a Yamaha Motif XF 7, and it doesn't have the full workstation capabilities. So, I just bought my 2nd Motif - a new XF7 with 1 gig of flash RAM and a LAN card. BUT - for sheer portability, ease, and for the 2nd synth when I'm traveling, the next one will very likely be the Nord Compact. Unless I get an Infinite Response with that phenomenol touch, and use it and a MacBook Pro along with the XF7. So why am I in the Nord users' forum? Am I just an jerk? Sometimes. I'm actually a fan of the Nord.Even though I don't own one, I think they are great boards, and everytime I have had to make a decision on a purchase, it has always been between a Nord and something else. I do think a Stage would be the best choice for an all-around board - and would have been my first choice if I hadn't really needed the full recording and sequencing capabilities of my original Motif. Even though I'm now using both Cubase and Logic Studio, the sequencing of the Yamahas is very powerful. I think a great combo would be the Motif XF8 and the Nord Stage 2 compact. What a great pairing that would be. If I was not partially reliant on hardware keyboard recording and needed just one keyboard for gigging or just playing, and didn't have the space or the cash for multiple boards - probably the Stage 2 Compact with a Macbook pro and some VSTs.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=17748&sid=91627fe37a670f7837df6037f1af1293#p17748

Seven years of research by three world-class Italian universities and an outstanding team of engineers and musicians from all over the world have worked together to develop the first musical instrument where different physical models coexist in order to play some of the instruments that have made music history over the last few decades.EXPRESSIONThanks to the expressive possibilities of Physis Piano, the user not only has complete control of the physical sound, but also unlimited customizations. It’s possible to create one’s own grand piano by modifying its length, its resonance, the morphology of the hammers, the properties of the string, and much more... or to configure one’s own electric piano by defining the position of the transducers or the size of the tone bar. All this is possible thanks to the stunning computational power that is able to perform 24 billion operations per second.INTERFACEPhysis Piano’s elegant design stems from an innovative and ergonomic tablet-style interface featuring an exclusive multi-touch, backlit black-glass panel with high-resolution graphic display. The interface can be totally customized and configured by the user according to his/her needs.TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS• SOUND ENGINE: PHYSIS, Physical Modeling Technology• APM: Acoustic Piano Model• EPM: Electric Piano Model• WPM: Wurly Piano Model• CPM: Clavi Piano Model• AMM: Acoustic Mallets Model• HDSE: High Definition Sound Engine.INTERFACE• MTP: Multitouch Panel• CCI: Custom Configurable Interface• HRD: High Resolution Display (480x272 px)KEYBOARD & PEDALS• PGK: Physis Grand Keyboard 88 (with RW real wooden keys and IS Ivory Sense)• GSP: Gradual Sustain PedalCONSTRUCTION• PAB: Pure Aluminum Body• BHG: Black Hard Glass• HPC: Hyper Parallel Computing (6 DSP)",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=14876&sid=91627fe37a670f7837df6037f1af1293#p14876

First, it's not that revolutionary: Modart Pianoteq (software) has been there for many many years, also Roland V-piano is from 2008 (if I remember right).But the most important, Physis did not sound like real piano, it sounded like average digital piano. If this is the reality, I don't care how many billions of calculations it's doing per second. I've been fan of Pianoteq since its first release, but I realize its difficulties and some artificial character in its sound. To my ears Physis had these same unwanted qualities. IMO V-piano has succeeded best to catch real woody attack of a real piano. Its problem is that it cannot give enough variety of different piano sounds to be really competitive to sampled pianos. (This is a best part of Pianoteq: it can really give you infinite amount of different sounds in different acoustic spaces)But after all, what sounded best and most natural from all those digital pianos? It was Nord Piano, it was a great to hear it from audience perspective and played by great player. It was the best.

In fact I had a real analog once: DSI Tetra, which I did not like that much: too few knobs, too few voices, sound was not my kind of ""warm"".At the moment I have Arturia Origin desktop, which is kind of a love and hate relationship. I like the general modular and template concept very much, It's very complex thing but same time very simple to use. It has 32 voices and 4 part multitimbrality (hard to believe, but this is quite rare thing to find with hardware VAs). It has a nice warm analog sound (TAE engine) and (at the moment) well made Minimoog and JP8 templates with nice graphical GUIs. The main concept is the modular system: you can put together different modules (Oscillators, filters etc.) from Minimoog, ARP, Prophet, JP8 etc. to have very unique sounds.Now the downsides: it's has a great potentiality to be almost anything, but this potential still waits for its realization. Arturia has promised to give us templates like CS-80,ARP2600 or Prophet V, but this promise was given on 2008 (or close). There are many frustrated owners waiting for updates. Arturia is painfully slow to develop this and I fear that time will pass and Origin will loose its battle to some newer ""Kronos"" with touchscreen and 100 voices and 20 analog emulations. Other thing is, that Origin should develop to also more modern direction: users (myself included) have asked Arturia to make some modern modules like supersaw.This critic been said, Origin is quite nice companion to my Nord setup. It gives me nice analog type pads under NP or NS2 E-pianos and same time I can play very moogish leads (which sound quality, I must admit, I haven't managed to get from NS2 synth...).",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=7721&sid=91627fe37a670f7837df6037f1af1293#p7721

Guess that means I don't really hate any of them.That said, the fact that my mint Polymoog has never worked for more than a week is annoying. I don't use the old digitals too much, so I guess I don't like the D50, SQ1, DX7 and CZ3000 as much as I used to. The JD800 is a useable exception in digital, which I still enjoy.I love the Andromeda, Voyager, Prophet 08, Oscar and Oddyssey. I don't use the A100 as much as I thought, but love the Technosaurus Mini Monsters and they interface well with both the A100 and a nice 5 Osc Elektor Formant I picked up recently. I love the Juno 6, but the JX8P or the Alpha Junos less so. The Matrix 6Rs came to life when I got the access programmer and remain favourites.I love the OBMX - I find it hard to see the bad points it's notorious for - I work around them or use a different synth. I'd love more voices in it, but then it's £££££££ again.Given my age, I got to play some of the big polys in the music stores in my late teens and early twenties, I have bad memories of the JP6 and haven't wanted one since. I loved the Rhodes Chroma and missed a great one which I regret. I found the Memorymoog overwhelming, but would like to try again some day. I just didn't get the Yamaha CS(x)M range or the Korg Sigma/Lamda/Delta range at the time (and couldn't afford them anyway). The Juno 6 and Polysix were great, and I eventually got both. The OBs were a dream to play, the JP8 never seemed to be in store (although I saw one in 89 for £450 in poor shape and let it pass). Oddly it was mostly through headphones in the stores.When the big Polys were affordable in the post DX7 crash, I didn't have the cash to buy them, so would still love a Prophet 5, OB8/X, JP8, Synthex and a CS80 - but all seem unlikely with current prices. I have a nice Trident II which I like, but it never felt in the same league as the other big Polys (but can produce some great sounds all the same).The Nord Lead 2 remains interesting, and even the supernova has it's modelling moments.The ESQ1 is also interesting, but I bought an SQ1 by accident first (doh!). eBay should limit the impact of drunk surfing and BINs!I did manage to get a lot of old Monosynths before the prices got silly, so I still find surprises in the old monos too - CS5, Micropreset, Explorer 1, Jen SX, SH101, SH09 etc can be refreshingly creative, often due to their limitations. The Spirit still appeals, as does the Syrinx and ARP2600 - more empty dreams at current prices.I have to say though, I play live with one keyboard these days - Nord Stage Classic and it's perfect for what I need.What has surprised me is Nanostudio on the iPad, which I now use for most writing - Logic has become a ""finishing tool"" rather than a writing tool which surprises me greatly.When I think of the rigs I used to play live with, I thank Nord for the Stage, and although the synth section is hardly complex, I can get a ""live"" version of most of what I need from the synth - so thumbs up.Funny though, writing this I am back in McCormacks Music or Thompsons Music in the early 1980s playing with the synths, and it feels as exciting now as it did then.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=7750&sid=91627fe37a670f7837df6037f1af1293#p7750

It had a dreadfully ""plasticky"" keyboard, not at all like the typical Pratt-Reed keyboard of it's predecessors.Still, the M12 is a sonic sight to behold when properly programmed to take advantage of it's unusually complex modulation routings.I nearly brought the roof down several times by midi'ing together the M12, Memorymoog+, prophet 5, and Jupiter-8 ""kenton midi retrofitted"".mush_or_80x.gif (74.29 KiB) Viewed 3157 timesI had an ARP Quadra, which was kind of a really cool sleeper synth combo that I wouldn't mind having another one of.But that might simply be ""Nostalgic GAS"" talkingCheers, Hanon",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=8844&sid=91627fe37a670f7837df6037f1af1293#p8844

My first was a Casio CT-202, a preset poly-ensemble with 49 sounds selected by pressing keys on the keyboard. It had an odd selection of sounds by modern standards (seven acoustic guitars, four harps, no string ensemble sound) and no touch-sensitivity, but it was one of the most playable keyboards I have known, particularly the flute and organ sounds, and if you put the Viola preset through a chorus pedal, it would give a Solina a good run for its money.I eventually added a Casio CZ-101 to my rig and became quite adept at programming it, primarily with imitative sounds, from percussion to guitars, saxes and steel drums. Somewhere I still have a ring-binder full of patch-sheets that I created. Along with the preset CT-202, the CZ-101 was my main synth for many years. You can hear some of the music I made with those two Casioshere.About 12 years ago it stopped working, and I replaced it with a second-hand CZ-1, with a full-size 5-octave keyboard, 16-note polyphony and velocity and after-touch. All my old patches worked fine, but somehow the magic was gone.

It's interesting to note that my preference for the pianos mirrors yours.I had only one goal and concept to demonstrate with my experiment, which is that the piano listening experience can be a completely different experience than the playing.When playing a piano, one becomes immersed in the mechanics of it.How does it feel?Do the dynamics react properly, and intuitively?Hows the tone, and resonance?What is the feel and response of the keybed?It's very difficult to separate the playing and listening experiences.One of my day jobs was as a piano technician/tuner, this gave me a unique opportunity to meet and network with lots of pianists. Quite frequently my customers would pay me to go to the piano store with them to advise on purchases. The older, more experienced pianists would ask me to play while they listened to how the piano ""just sounded"" without the ""tedium of playing"".This is how my theory of the two different experiences was formed.I know some of you already know this, some get it, but some are asking ""what does it mean?'The listening experience is the ONLY experience your audience is likely to share with you the performer.The playing experience is yours ALONE.It's up to you as the performer to know the difference between the two.Cheers, HanonBTW:Here is the MIDI file that I created to do the test with, if you'd like to put your own piano recording up for comparison.""P200, P250, SV-1 etc....""test3.midPianos taste test midi file(5.5 KiB) Downloaded 338 times",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=5025&sid=91627fe37a670f7837df6037f1af1293#p5025

I have no idea which sounds you are using, but the grand piano (example 1) sounds very good. Maybe the string resonance is a little overemphasized (a little too much resonance from the low strings, when the high strings are played) and the stereo projection is not ideal for my taste as well. I personally would prefer all the Nords and the SV-1 to this one, but would prefer this one to the Motif and the M3.The second example does not really fit in here, I think, because it seems to be an upright piano.By the way: I have just downloaded your newest CD on iTunes.

I am going to transport it by plane, so the Ion was a little bit to big for me to fit in my luggage. Then I truly disliked the Miniak Interface. The R3's vocoder was superb while the Ultranova's disappointed. Then there is those ridiculous R3's mini pitch and modulation wheels and the displays are not all that clear to see. Ultranova is Blue and that fits with my non black keyboard rig, plus it has got a very nice interface and the display I found was very clear and easy to read.

(You also have strong organs in the Kronos that you can trigger from a second board.)Brass is stronger on the Yamaha, as it has velocity layers and articulations that are not available with Nord's sample library approach. However, you may find suitable brass on your Kronos (especially if you load the full EXs3 library), and again, you can MIDI the two so you can trigger the Korg's brass sounds off the Nord if you prefer, and you can even use the Korg's assignable outs so that you can still keep the sound unmixed with whatever sound you may be playing on the Korg at the same time, if you'd like.Lead sounds, I'd go with the Nord, because of the hands-on knobby synth functionality. Though again, you can also use MIDI to trigger Korg lead sounds from, well, whatever board you put on top.

While I did suffer a bit on the organ end of things (the lack of proper keyboard and real-time control the C2 has) I managed to function fine.  There are enough pre-mapped options to get through the gig as it is downloaded.  That seems to be the idea behind the Muse, usable right of the start.

No IMOI think the SK is some where in between NE3 and NS2 function wise. Shure you get alot of extra features on the NS2 as full synth, mod wheel, pith bend, user made sounds etc. etc. but does these features justify that you can get two SK-1´s for the price of one NS2? There is alot of different answers to that i knowAt the end of the day i guess the success of SK depends on how people will feel about the ""extra voices"" ´cause we already know that they do know how to make a good Hammond sound from the XK series.psYou dident have any personal experience with the SK right hanon?

I also have a Nord C2 organ that I typically run thru a Leslie 3300, a Nord electro 3, and a Nord electro 2. First, the action on the Hammond SK1 is a little stiffer than even the C2. The sounds of the two organs are very similar; I love the C2 and had the C1 before it. The Hammonds on the SK1 definitely sound different though; better or worse is very subjective terrain but I really like the Hammonds on the SK1. I think the percussion on the SK1 might be more like the real thing and the Leslie sim on the SK1 is very, very good as is the sim on the C2. The SK1 seems to spit, burp, and rip a little more than either the Nord electro 3 or my C2 though you can tweak the latter quite nicely. The Hammond SK1 might just be a little bit more of the real thing to my ears (having owned 3 real B-3's) but it's a close call.The Wurli in the SK1 is excellent and fully tweakable as it is on the Nord electro 2 or 3. The two Rhodes in the SK1 are really good too as are the acoustic pianos which you can not say for any of the Nord's I've had.  The electric pianos on the Hammond are surprisingly good however and I have a real Wurlitzer and a real Rhodes 73 suitcase to compare it to. The clavinet is excellent on the Hammond SK1 as it is on both Nord elecrto's I have (I'm partial to the NE2 for clav). I have a real clavinet D6 and both the Nord and Hammond SK1 are comparable without the amplification hassles (and tuning) issues of a real clav.I use my electro 3 for brass and flute very often in our band and the wind samples in the Hammond SK1 are in my opinion awful.I cannot be without my Nord electro 3 for all of the parts I cover in my band. I use another keyboard for acoustic piano. Often, I take a third keyboard (the Nord C2 and a Leslie 3300) and this is what I'd use the Hammond SK1 for. In my opinion,   the Nord electro 3 is more versatile and does more things well than the new Hammond SK1 (i.e. the brass, strings, accordion). The action on the Hammond SK1 is, in my opinon, superior to the Nord electro 3 though I have not tried the new version of the electro 3 with weighted keys. If you just want organ perhaps the Hammond SK1 has the Nord elecro 3 beat. The Hammond SK2 (two manual organ) is not yet available and will supposedly be hard to get unlike the Nord C2 which I really like. Also, Hammond charges a pretty penny more for their proprietary expression pedal which always annoyed me.  Last thing: the Nord side panels are red wood. The Hammond SK1's side panels are cheap plastic and seem prone to cracking which is not the case with anything made by Nord.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=5417&sid=91627fe37a670f7837df6037f1af1293#p5417

(As did their Korg CX3 and Roland VK8 competitors.) At some point someone realized that many gigging musicians are more interested in lighter weight than it traditional aesthetics. But they still make the cooler looking and more capable 2-manual XK-3c system. And also... technology improves... and every company always adjusts to the market... and companies often take turns in leading and following in trends. At any rate, I think it's a good thing, that the SK2 exists.
