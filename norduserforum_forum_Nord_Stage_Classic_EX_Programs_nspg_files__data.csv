My manual doesn't say much about it, only that factory programs can be restored via MIDI SysEx files. Right at the start of this thread, Johannes says ""It is unfortunate IMHO that the NS"" does not understand the .nspg format, but maybe there is a solution sometime in the (near?) future."" (did he mean NS2 maybe??). Also the Nord website has a sample library, but absolutely nothing is available for the classic Stage except factory restore. All this only confirmed my wrong impression over the years.Anyway, now suddenly I discover I CAN transfer other people's .nspg programs to my Stage. This is great!!! But I was just wondering why I never knew before ...It's nice to have 200 programs available via this forum, but why can't Nord have in their sound library a whole bunch of patches for classic Stage models? Wouldn't that be relatively easy and a wonderful resource?Micky",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=90440&sid=fda88daa4b185d454aaf377c14a24db5#p90440

How you can then tell which of the new samples (v.5) is being used by each new V.5 patch. As I'm on the classic I'm trying to get the piano section sounding closer to the patches provided in the EX.I can not get my piano patches with V.5 samples sounding as good as I did when I had V.4 samples installed. Especially at my live gigs I can not get the new piano's cutting through the mix as I did with V.4Any more thoughts on this subject and comparison are appreciated.

Unforunately I recorded every single sound I made on Nord Stage EX on Logic so it's impossible for me to make a .nsmp file.Anyway, to be honest, these sounds are ""quite"" simple to be replicated. I use this intro as a backing tracks when I play with my band, it's something technically difficult to reproduce because of the arpeggiator that is triggered as you play the chords (note sequence change each chord).I think Mr Mister also changed this intro to be ""manually played"" during live performance or play it with a backing track.frantzkb wrote:I do like the whole thing but the last sound especially ( I'd say the Oberheim like ), unfortunately I do not own a the NS classic / EX  but the NS 2.Greetings tooYes it's very frustrating this lack of compatibility between the 2 models!!!

At the end of the song, the 2nd synth is used for a few bars and then joined by the 1st synth.  At the very end you can hear the difference in the vibrato/LFO used for each on the Stage 3 - for the Stage/EX, you may need to improvise with the pitch stick.

Thanks!The sound manager does not convert programs from one Nord generation to the next, it only manages samples (and allows you to organize the location of patches/programs).You cannot convert from 2 or 3 to 4, there is no utility that will do that. What you can do, if the program uses a sample (and the sample is available) is load the sample on the stage 4 and recreate the rest of the sound using the synth controls with that sample.However, for the ""just what I needed"" sound, you can do that with the built in synth engine without the need for samples.here is a tutorial for the Stage 3 that you can adapt to the Stage 4.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=179590&sid=fda88daa4b185d454aaf377c14a24db5#p179590

That is, NS2 owners basically need to create their patches ""from scratch"".I think the main difference are in the Synth section which required the new file format, which makes sense given the greatly enhanced capacities of the NS2 (just look at the file size: 426 vs. 547 bytes). Subsequently the Synth Patches (.nss) cannot be used on the NS2 neither.So if one really needed to carry over a particular patch the easies would be having both instruments and just copying all settings ""by hand"" on the front panel. Given the easy layout of the Nords this should be quite easy while only having the nspg file will not allow you to do so.So I would say sorry for the moment at least, but .nspg patches are EX/Classic ONLY, and vice versa.Still maybe it could be technically be possible for NORD to develop a converter for the PC which would convert classic patches into NS2 ones (obviously one would loose the ES/Classic only features (OK the only one I can think of is the LOW/HIGH EQ in the Synth section).If one were crazy enough to look into the NSPG file format one could maybe reverse engineer the format.Basically, the NSPG patches (426 bytes) seem to contain in total MAX(!) 16*20 Offsets, i.e., a maximum of 81920 bits of information content, so by (a hell lot!!) of trial and error one might find out which byte=00 switches to 01 if, e.g., Piano Section A is enabled etc.Here is an example of the Hex view for one patch, you can see the magnitude of 00 and 01 while for quasi-continuous values the coding requires even more guess work.patch_hex.png (32.07 KiB) Viewed 30154 timesBut I honestly don't think it would be very useful!Moreover, playing around with the values could seriously damage your very valuable and thus expensive instrument!! Not to mention you' lose any warranty!!After all, the Nord Stage is very easy to program and create patches ""on the fly"" so for me there is no point in messing around with the great stuff provides us with.(Now if I were to buy a Kronos with its basically fullfledged PC inside running some kind of a linux derivative it might be another story...)But maybe Nord COULD release a small utility to convert CLASSIC/EX patches into the .NS2P format (if and only if it is technically doable)! It would IMHO be a great recognition of the Classic/EX line in this sense maintaining backward compatibility!But for the time being, there is no way around it, so you have to ask someone with a Classic/EX to tell you the settings of a particular patch and dial it in manually!Cheers!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=2474&sid=fda88daa4b185d454aaf377c14a24db5#p2474

I noticed on the video that each note starts out being out of tune and then settles so I tried to get that affect. For this program the TIMBRE CONTROL gets set slightly above 0 to be slightly out of tune initially with the true note. The MOD ENV REL/DECAY determines how long it takes for the two ""oscillators"" to come together and filter to close to end state. The MOD ENV ATTACK is set about 10 o'clock to open up the filter. The LP FILTER FREQ CONTROL will adjust how much contrast you want between the sound of the filter at its most-open point and the filter at the end of the decay. The LP FILTER FREQ will determine somewhat the midpoint of the filter based on the range set by the FREQ CONTROL.  The mp3 covers the initial patch, adjustments to the parameters above, then addition of echo and reverb for a quick ""Jump"" rendition.OB-8 Brass     W.nspgOberheim OB-8 Brass Patch(426 Bytes) Downloaded 2756 timesNordStageEX_OB-8 Brass Patch W.mp3This next one I put together this evening based on the JX-10 brass on SoundCloud - playing with the EQ and filters can bring out the midrange a little if needed.

Demonstrating the flexibility of the Stage EX, what you hear in the song is a single take with no overdubbing of the various sounds used.

I'm new to this forum and have recently downloaded all the sounds you guys have created and posted here.So now I'm going to share what I have done so far.FM synthesis is a very exciting thing.Since I once had a DX7 in the eighties I do remember how the typical FM-epiano sound was constructed.As Johannes showed us it consists of three modulator-carrier pairs.One pair creates the body of the sound which is the result of a modulator-carrier frequency-ratio of 1:1.The modulator's envelope generator sets the time variant modulation intensity which leads to a frequency spectrum that can't be created by subtractive synthesis, no matter how complex the basic waveform may be.This part of the sound can in deed be reproduced by the Nord Stage and it sounds more or less exactly like the DX7. It's just the very sophisticated key follow parameters that the Stage is missing.The modulation intensity is controlled by the Timbre parameter.The DX7's second modulator-carrier pair usually does just the same with only a little detuning.This can be simulated by the Stage's unison function.The third pair now is responsible for the bell-like attack sound that made the DX7 famous.It's the result of a modulator-carrier frequency-ratio of 14:1.Unfortunately the Stage doesn't offer this particular ratio.The highest possible ratio is 9:1.To add at least this one you need to use the synth section of the other panel.(Since 9:1 doen't exactly produce a perferct bell character try and switch this panel one octave higher.)No matter how authentic you might think this sound is it's still very suitable to be added to a grand piano sound for pop piano styles.If you are in need of a synth pad background sound after you have frittered away both panels for the DX7 emulation just misuse the Farfisa. It sounds not really good but acceptable at a pinch.Let me know your opinion ...Taenzerin.mp3Grand + DX.mp3DX7-II.mp3",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=590&sid=fda88daa4b185d454aaf377c14a24db5#p590

It sounds like one of the sounds has either a pitch envelope or glissando ""Yamaha DX/TX"" which causes it to slide up to the note.In my patch attempt, I made a judgement call that the brassy lead was the strongest, most recognizable part, and concentrated on it.The synth section of the NSex lacks a pitch envelope and polyphonic glide. The only thing I could think of the fatten it up was to make a mono lead version of the horn sound, alter the attack slightly and add glide.You folks can be the judge as to whether it works or not.

But it sounds to me like the intro sound is not played on the CP-70. It seems to me, that it is played on the hammond with added phaser. The organ is two-manual, so the intro sound is probably played with left hand, while playing the other organ stuff with the right, before it shifts into the synth stuff.Later in the song at 4.48 you can hear the cp-70 more clearly and it sounds nothing like the intro-sound.I tried playing the organ with phaser and it sounds about right to me.Just my thoughts.

All the other drawbars completely off.No Vibrato or Percussion.Rotor on, and the Drive (distortion) to about 8.No effects, the sound is completely dry.I also have the Keyclick set to maximum 10. On the Electro, I'm guessing that that would correspond to Key Click level (in the B3 Menu) of H2. That's just to add a little treble to the sound. You could also just add a little treble from the EQ (say about +2 or+3)A few things to note:I don't know if the Drive is the same between the Stage and Electro, so you may need different settings. But basically you add as much Drive as you can until just before it starts to sound mushy or indistinct.Finally, a lot of the sound is how you play the chords. This is vitally important. Generally for this style of playing, you don't play the third of the chord, only the root and fifth, or root, fifth and octave.You can also add deep single notes or octaves in the left hand.So, for example, to play C major, you might play it as CG, GC, or CGC in the right hand while playing C two octaves down from middle C in the left hand, or CC one and two octaves down from middle C. This gives the chords the extra growl and bite.Generally, you would just adjust the exact right hand notes to get the effect you want. Playing lower in the right hand makes the sound thicker and stronger, but might conflict with the guitar player (although that's not usually a problem with a Blackmore-style player). Playing higher will make the sound thinner and weaker, but will be heard more clearly in the mix.BTW, if you're playing the riff for Hard Loving Man, it will always sound weak and thin by itself. The trick is to add the root notes of the chord in the left hand at the same time, three and a half octaves below the riff.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=59563&sid=ec63f4303f65037b235472d83769e068#p59563

The latter can be overcome by using the two synth sections simultaneously which is why I will post the results as complete programs (.pgm files).If you are interested or have any comments or your own experiences, feel free to post them here.Johannes",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=232&sid=ec63f4303f65037b235472d83769e068#p232

But after doing some calibrations, FFT analysis etc. I finally have the tools layed out to start building the patches.Note that while I've played shortly at friends' places e.g. a Moog and others, I am not an expert of Analog Synths. So reading Welshs Cookbook (http://cgi.ebay.com/WELSHS-SYNTHESIZER- ... 918wt_1037) was really a great inspiration and helped me a lot. Still, the following might be a bit too technical for complete Newbies, while for sure completely obvious for Analog Freaks (who hardly would by a Nord Stage for its Synth I guess...). UPDATE: Here you can now find a PDF version:http://synthesizer-cookbook.com/SynCookbook.pdfFor those completely new to this stuff,http://www.soundonsound.com/search?url= ... ummary=Yesis a good and huge reference if you don't want to invest in a book.It is basically my experience in the quest to get EVERYTHING out of the NS Synth. For the farer future, I am planing on buying a Moog LP or Voyager, but given I just spend a fortune on the red beauty, this has to wait, so for the moment I stick to learning and getting all I can out of the Nord (starting to understand the values of all the parameters etc.).In any case, any ideas, own experiences, critics are highly welcomed, in particular since IMHO the manual is not too informative on the Synths capabilities.The basic things you need for creating some nice Patches with an Analog Style synthesizer are two oscillators, Filter, Envelopes, LFOs and some additional small tools. Given that the Nord Stage Synth engine is kind of stripped down compared e.g. to the Nord Lead, I had to figure out how to overcome some shortcomings. Moreover, the Documentation in the Manual is not perfect as in particular the settings for the Timbre control are not well documented so I had to measure them myself.In the following I report my findings which I am currently using to build some patches of natural instruments as well as recreating some classical Analog synths.1) Oscillators:Typically, two oscillators will suffice for most basic jobs.(a) non-synchedThe basic ones used are the Sawtooth(S), Pulsewidth(P), and triangle(T) forms along with noise(n) and SINE(C/ turning Timbre to zero).However, only the Sawtooth is available also with two oscillators (Sd). In this case, the relative pitch of the second osc can be adjusted with the timbre know where 0=-1Octave, 5.0=equal, 10.0=+1Octave, i.e., one semitone equals 0.42 on the scale. On top, the oscs can be detuned up to 10cents using the UNISON knob. Shortcoming: the level of both oscs is fixed and equal.The T & P oscillators don't allow two different oscillators at a time. One method of overcoming this limitation is using both Synth sections of Panel A & B at the same time which allows at least to detune the oscillators by +/- 1 octave (e.g. for a Marimba sound). You have a second option if you need the oscs only slightly out of tune using the UNISON knob in its first half of the range which allows adding a second oscillator up to 10cents out of tune.RemarksThe Pulsewidth Waveform is important and the pulsewidth can be adjusted by the timbre knob where 0.0=50% and 10.0=1%, i.e. increasing the value by 1.0 decreases the width by 5% (e.g.,20% width would be timbre=8.0).A Sine wave is not directly integrated. You can use the ""C/"" waveform but i found that it has a very strong second harmonics and weak 3th and 4th, no idea why. Another option is the FM program 1 with TIMBRE set to zero which looks/sounds more like a true sine wave, or lastly:Use the NOISE generator, Resonance at 10.0, 24db Filters and adjust the frequency to the desired tone (Set the Cutoff to 330 Hz (i.e., the cutoff frequency shown in the display is the one applied if one plays the note E1) if you want to play the notes as if it where a Piano (A1=~A1). While not being a perfect sine, this allows on top using the keyboard track buttons to create a oscillator which is independent of the key you play (which on a traditional synth you can select using the KeyTrack switch and is useful for some sounds).]The last point is also a way of having e.g. a Square wave on one Synth and mixing it with a Sine with continuosly varying relative pitch as is needed for a variety of sounds!So how to calculate the Cutoff frequency if you want the Sine, say, a fifth that is 7 semitones (dx=7) above the other, fundamental pitch? Just calculate it as  330*(2^(dx/12)) Hz, e.g., for a fifth over the fundamental pitch (=7 semitones), just set Cutoff=494Hz.(b)synchedThe Stage features a second oscillator for creating hard-synched sounds which can be created on any analogue >=2 Osc oscillator by swithinc Sync ON, so in this case we are fine with the stage. The timbre know in this case controls the pitch of the synchronized osc (thus changing only the color of the tone, as the main pitch is controlled by the Master osc). Using the timbre knob you can set the pitch of the slave osc (which must be higher than the Master's pitch). At 0.0, the pitches are equal, at 3.8 the slave's pitch is one octave higher, at 7.6 it is two octaves higher, i.e., one semitone equals approximately 0.3 on the scale.FiltersObviously there are a wide range of filters used in analog synths, still, the LP is by far the most common so the NS does a good job in this section.Envelope GeneratorsYou get basic stuff with the Nord Stage, but it suffices for most what I am currently looking at: an AEG and FEG with two adjustable parameters each. Obviously, the classical 4 Parameter ADSR envelope would be nice to have but I can mostly live with it.The only ""real"" shortcoming for me is if you want an LFO you cannot use the FEG at the same time.LFOsAt the beginning I did not quite use it a lot but after working a lot with the Synth section, I now consider it really well done by CLAVIA to squeeze it in the Stage.IMHO you have several LFO options on the Nord Stage(a) Vibrato/Pitch-LFO: The vibrato Switch allows to set some basic vibrato which can be set to 4-8Hz in ths SYSTEM menu and is triggered differently. If you want it always, assign it to the Wheel and always have it up.(b) Tremolo/Amplitude-LFO: Using the Tremolo effect gives you this effect when set to the Synth section(c) But the most important LFO (and the one most likely to resemble a ""real"" one) is the repeat mode of the Filter Envelope Generator. By adjusting the Attack and Decay Value you can create basically anything between a triangle and Sawtooth waveform. If you want to set it to a particular frequency, knowing that frequency is just the inverse of time, compute f=1/(t_Attack+t_Decay). So if you need an LFO of triangle waveform with 10Hz, you need a cycle length of 1/10=0.1Seconds implying 50ms for both Attack and Decay.This LFO can than be either used to control the Cutoff frequency (WahWah, for this, you could also use one of the WahWah FXs) or the Timbre Parameter of the oscillator. In particular, when applied using a Pulsewidth Oscillator, you have PulseWidthModulation(PWM)!The restWhat do classical Analog Synths have on top of these basic tools? You might find the UNISON feature which enriches the sounds by adding slightly detuned oscs, which the NS has integrated, a Sample&Hold Waveform which creates computer-type sounds (NS doesn't have one), Glide/Portamento (NS does), Legato/Mono/Poly modes (as well), Ring Modulation(see the FX section) and switching Keyboard tracking on/off (can be somehow replicated using the Noise generator with fullResonance).Bottom line, the NS is for sure not the most tweakable VA on the market and has certain limitations (Most importantly, not all osc combinations/tunings are possible, only LP filter and only two parameters per Envelope Generator). However, after working hard on replicating several sounds I heard from classical Moog etc. Synths I must say that you can do still quite lot. On thing however is to interpret the values of some of the knobs since they are not always meaningful and have to be calculated in order to get the desired result (e.g. detuning a second sawtooth e.g., 7 semitones).In the following posts I will upload some of the results I obtained using above descriptions in recreating some ""classical"" sounds.UPDATE: An updated version of this post can be downloaded in the downloads section:Nord Stage – How to use the Virtual Analog Synth",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=248&sid=ec63f4303f65037b235472d83769e068#p248

Althogh I have until know used mainly my hearing in order to get a desired sound, rather than theory to replicate or make one.Also of note are the envelopes, they are actually quite cleverly made, specially for the LFO like Env. Wile you can only control attack and rel/decay, you are able to put a sustain, which lasts for as much as you keep the key pressed (I find it that only in this case the Env really does release), you are also able to set it to simply attack and decay. This is due to the fact that both the AEG and FEG have something called ENV MODE, which is selected by pressing shift and moving the decay knob, and looking which one is lighted up. Each have a third mode, on the FEG, you have the LFO like feature while in the AEG you got an envelope shaped differently, kind of a middle ground between sustain and simply decaying, almost like a piano-like envelope.Gus",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=249&sid=ec63f4303f65037b235472d83769e068#p249

(4)(5) For a fifth over the fundamental pitch (7 semitones), just set the cut-off frequency to 502Hz (6).(1) Is this information from a recipe in Welsh’s Synthesizer Cookbook?(2) What does “dx” refer to?(3) Does 8.05 mean 8 semitones and 5 cents?(4) Did you use 330 because you set the cut-off frequency to 330Hz earlier?(5) What is “Exp”?(6) How did you arrive at 502Hz?Thanks!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=58659&sid=ec63f4303f65037b235472d83769e068#p58659

I fixed it, but actually a better version of this description can be found in the download section:Nord Stage – How to use the Virtual Analog SynthBasically, it refers to creating synth sounds with two detuned oscillators using the noise generator with full resonance  which basically creates a sine wave and then the cutoff sets the frequency. The formula just computes the frequency from the desired interval. dx=7 semitones means a relative difference in frequency of (2)^(7/12)=1.49 so that the frequency of a fift is 49% over the fundamental. Since 330Hz at the Nord is calibrated to sound like A4 (or that the cutoff displayed is the one applied on the note E1 (obviously the cut off frequency varies across the key range unless keyb tracking is completely disabled, so the displayed value needs to be choosen to represent one key), you need to increase the cut-off fequency to 330*1.498=494Hz to have the sine sound one fifth over the fundamental (e.g., piano sound or second panel synth sound).In the welsh Cook Book they give many sound description containing two detuned oscillators (e.g., by 8 semitones and 5 cents for the harmonica sound), which can be programmed roughly this way.Sorry if it wasn't all clear.(Note: Exp would be the exponential function, but technically it's a twelfth root, fixed in the doc. The 502 Hz is the value for 8 semitones and 7cents (not 5, sorry my error) (approx) indeed and refers to information given in the Welsh Cook book, see here:harmonica_synth_welsh.png (53.31 KiB) Viewed 10290 times",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=58684&sid=ec63f4303f65037b235472d83769e068#p58684

If you have a separate filter envelope, get the filter to open up slightly as the sound is held down.Then explore the wavetables as your sound source, and find something that sounds right.

Thus, with two Panels/Slots one has a max of six onboard sounds happening at once.  It will be HUGELY important for you to fully understand this in order to fully understand the instrument.I do have an EX but frankly don't feel like going to trouble of loading these programs right now (it's past 2am here) and anyway you will gain more knowledge and understanding from doing this for yourself...To determine whether your desired ""mega-program"" will be possible, first examine the SUPERSONIC program's basic settings on each of the two Panels.  Don't sweat the details right now.  All you need to know is which instrument sections are being used in the lower zone of the program to produce the sound you want.  Be sure to check both panels.  Now switch to the VIVALDI program and do the same thing for the upper zone.  Please send us the results of your exploration to continue this analysis in detail......but in the meantime, let me create an illustrative example which may help you: suppose that SUPERSONIC uses both a Panel A synth and a Panel B synth in the low zone, and that VIVALDI uses both a Panel A synth and a Panel B synth in the high zone.  That's four synths and you only have two to work with in a single program.  That's what Mr G. meant by ""you might need 4 slots"" (keeping in mind that what Nord used to call a Panel is now called a Slot)  Conceptually he is right about that, but that's not particularly useful to you because the instrument does not have 4 slots/panels -- it has two.Successful ""marriages"" between two programs will always hinge on one major consideration: can the entirety of each individual sound be produced in full with the available sounds at hand: two organs, two pianos and two synths.Hope this helps...if you'd like specific analysis on your specific scenario, please post back to the forum with the internal details of each  of the two panels for each of the two programs -- what instrument sections are required to produce the sounds you want, and we can offer specific advice on your desired situation.  (if need be, I can be cajoled into loading those programs into my EX...)Bless,Pablo",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=44304&sid=19c4526d79c315895bef1ba837678d7e#p44304

I also use a Nord Wave so my patch wouldn't automatically work for you, but you might be able to use some of my ideas.For the opening sound, to supplement the drums, I sampled a range of drums and reversed them on my computer before loading them on to my Wave.  I then layered this with my NS piano in the bottom octave.  I used panel B and the middle zone for a second piano sound running through the tremelo and amp sim to do some shaping with the EQ for the little arpeggio type hook at the start.  In the chorus, I switched to a new patch layering an untreated piano and a choir sound from my Wave.  In the second verse there is a filtered drum sound at the start, so again, back to keyed sampled drum hits on the Wave using the filters.I know you can't do what I did on just an EX, but suffice to say, even with two keyboards, I had to make careful use of the zones plus two separate patches on both devices to make it work.  It was well worth the effort though as it really rocked!

This sound uses the EP3 Mk11 Shallow rhodes.* Song 11 ""Rustic Road"" -PIANO: is the Studio Grand 2 YaC7 with onboard EQ set to: Treble -5.5db, Mid 0db, Bass +1.5db, Reverb: Stage, Dry/Wet 2.5, String Resonance: ON.ORGAN: is the B3 with various settings (attached 14.3 Organ - MASTER)PAD: this was a sound within Logic using the EXS24 ""Big Pad MW"" plugin* Song 13 ""Resonance""* LEAD: (attached 16.2 Lead&Chords)* PIANO: this was the Studio Grand 2 YaC7 with above EQ settings + arp settings (attached 13.2 UROG)* ORGAN: same as above (attached 14.3 Organ - MASTER)Overall, I used plugins on the album to achieve the smooth pad sound. However, I've attached another sample (19.6 Pad ATMOSPHERE), which is the best smooth pad I've been able to achieve on the Nord.We had to do some EQing within Logic, to mix the album and pull down some of the MIDS and LOW MID frequencies. On top of that, the album has been professionally mastered, to smooth out some of the harsh top ends and bellowing bottom ends.I've learnt a lot through the recording process and still have many things to learn ahead in future projects.You're able to check out the 13 x track album samples at:http://www.traceychattaway.comOR you can listen to full length samples athttp://traceychattaway.bandcamp.com/.Thanks for allowing me to share and I hope some of you find the samples helpful.Kind regardsTracey ChattawayOrgan - MASTER.nspg14.3 Organ - MASTER(426 Bytes) Downloaded 983 timesLead and Chords.nspgLead and Chords(426 Bytes) Downloaded 884 timesPad ATMOSPHERE.nspgPad ATMOSPHERE(426 Bytes) Downloaded 1029 timesUROG.nspgArpeggio/ping pong Piano(426 Bytes) Downloaded 802 timesWalk On.nspgArpeggio/ping pong rhodes(426 Bytes) Downloaded 841 times",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=24805&sid=19c4526d79c315895bef1ba837678d7e#p24805

I did route everything through MIDI, in order to save and create loads of ideas whilst composing songs. This way I was able to quantize the arpeggios and experiment with different sounds, before finalising each individual recorded track. The pianos were ""live"" but were also recorded via MIDI. I changed my mind several times about which pianos samples I wanted to use and was also able to use the smaller file samples loaded on my EX while composing. When outputting final recordings I uploaded the XL file sizes to my Nord, one by oneMy first Nord was the classic, and then I upgraded to the EX a few years later, so I currently have enough memory to load some of the XL pianos. Mind you, it still doesn't seem like enough memory any more, as I have to continually delete and upload the Nord piano samples (depending on the song I'm writing). I don't regret buying the EX, as it was the best that Nord had on offer at the time. It's only now, that they're creating bigger file samples, I'm beginning to feel the age of my EX. However, I bought it with the intention of keeping it for decades .......in 50 years these original Nords will be sought-after classicsIt would be brilliant if there was a way to connect an external hard-drive/flashdrive directly to the EX/Classics, so that the memory capabilities wouldn't be an issue.Can you load any of the XL files onto your Nord Classic? Are you doing some recording yourself?Kind regardsTracey",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=26394&sid=19c4526d79c315895bef1ba837678d7e#p26394

The velocity layers are the same as on the other sizes.The Large versions have String Resonance samples all across the keyboard, providing you with a very full sound.Meaning that the XL really has one sample per key.

However, if over-applied, pins the sound squarely to the 1980sI hope this helps.I remember reading an interview with a keyboardist like Steve Porcaro where he said that when he got a new synth, the first thing he did was dump all of the factory programs and start programming sounds from scratch.This was a ""sink or swim"" method of learning a new piece of gear, the first 10 or so sounds were really difficult, but, by then you began to really understand what made your synth work, and the panel became more intuitive.Cheers, Hanon",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=8758&sid=77e18a620435a9acb2d52a72d791449e#p8758

Never heard of Eloy, but the others are some of my favorite pieces!! Unfortunately I'm in a jazz band and when I do get to play progressive rock the project is abandoned due to lack of guitar player....Still, might have a look tomorrow to see if I can get close results. Most of the Camel stuff is not hard to achieve, but it will unavoidedly sound different. Keep in mind its not about getting the sound 100% replicated. Because different gear sounds different. You do not know which Electric Piano Bardens had, or even if he had a B3 or other organ from hammond. As credited, he had the following in the Snow Goose Album:  Peter Bardens:	 Organ, Mini Moog, Electric Piano, Pipe Organ, Acoustic Piano, ARP Odyssey       So in other words to sound exactly like him on that album you must have exactly the same gear. But since that is near to impossible my opinion is that most synth sounds must be an aproximation. But organs can be almost duplicated.Also, here is an excellent page with midi files for camel:http://web.agria.hu/kepenu/camel.htm",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=29622&sid=77e18a620435a9acb2d52a72d791449e#p29622

Yes - I haven't had my EX long but have been messing around with the SYNTH section. After you get the tone you'd like to play with, one way is to work with the MOD ENV and LP Filter sections to get the effect. Hold the SHIFT button down and then turn the REL/DECAY ENV MODE in the MOD ENV section until both lights indicate the REP function is active. Release the SHIFT button. Turn the ATTACK and REL/DECAY ENV MODE in the MOD ENV section to about 10 o'clock (turning counter clockwise speeds up the repetition). The ATTACK control can be adjusted to whether you want a sharp attack in the repetition trigger (turning toward 7 o'clock) or something more like a sine wave like what's heard in the video. Both controls should be worked with to set the speed. The FREQ CONTROL VELOCITY and FREQ controls in the LP FILTER section can be adjusted to define how much sweep there is between the high and low thresholds of the repetition. RESONANCE in the LP Filter adds another dimension to the sounds but you have to be careful, it can be like feedback and blow out some serious low frequency pulses in the REP mode - work at low volume until you know what you have. I'm sure those more familiar with the SYNTH section may have some short cuts too. Good Luck.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=6198&sid=77e18a620435a9acb2d52a72d791449e#p6198

Second you can load programs/patches from Nord (basically only the Presets), but also user-created programs (such as the ones found here:http://www.norduserforum.com/nord_stage ... ection.php). They are in the format *.nspg and you have to load them using the NS Manager downloading them to the PROGRAM tab.You can NOT load samples though (.nsmp files) either user-created or from the Nord Sample Library.But for Hammond Sounds you should be easily able to load some other presets from the Collection linked above. It might be a good idea to check if your OS is the most recent version (v5.04, check after switching it on in the display).Cheers!Johannes",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=20581&sid=77e18a620435a9acb2d52a72d791449e#p20581

There seem to be a lot samples of all kinds of instruments. In the performance mode its pretty easy to layer multiple horns and tweek them to your liking.   And even though I don't use the drum samples out live they are great to practice to. Also The Nord with its assignable foot pedals does a nice job of switching and turning on and off the arpeggios. And with all the sounds you can layer with the Nord plus the sounds from the Motif rack make for some really fat textures.,https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=14580&sid=77e18a620435a9acb2d52a72d791449e#p14580

You sound like you will be needing doits/bends/falls etc.i still use an EMU ULTRA sampler (which can read Wav. files).  It is old but still great.  i run it thru a Lexicon MX Reverb module (as all my samples are 'dry'). i only use about 5 x brass samples but i reall love them all (and use them all the time).  i picked it up an ebay a couple of years ago for about £350 (and sellers very often include huge libraris of samples).  i midi this up to an M-Audio controller keyboard on gigs.And i have a Roland JV1080 (as TomS suggests) and this is a fantastic 'all round' module.  i think the Brass sounds (and everything in general) are far superior to the popular Karg Triton.  They have a great cross section of analogue thru to orchestral brass and you can buy expansion boards for around £80 on ebay.  i midi this up to my Nord also for strings/choirs which layer well with the Nord pianos.Or if you have the money, the new TYROS 3 is totally out of this world and completely blew my mind !!Hope this helps dude.Best,monsterjazzlicks",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=17525&sid=77e18a620435a9acb2d52a72d791449e#p17525

I love your handmade drawbars controller.The click is the filter being modulated by a rather sharp envelope.If you'll reduce the ""LP Filter, Freq control, mod envelope"" setting to zero then adjust the LP Filter frequency to suit tastes, that should eliminate the click.As an alternate solution; slightly increase the amp envelope attack time, that should do the trick also.Cheers, Hanon",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=3046&sid=4ff479b4a499d9a2c1278f341f33fd41#p3046

(only on the Album Version on ""Wish you were here"")Now the good thing with the Panels is that you can switch between Panels while the sound you sustain with the Pedal does not stop.So hold the G Octave on Panel A, slowly turn the MOD wheel to increase volume, Hold the SUSTAIN Pedal down. Then switch to Panel B, play a slow slide over the whole key range, switch back, hold the G Octave again and start with the Synth Line.Feel free to further work on it if you want, in particularI recall having more convincing Mini Moog Settings but I lost them.CrazyDiamond.mp3",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=1114&sid=6b77c4bd59138bb0f093b2587ffd08f1#p1114

I can see a problem with this if you need to play the two sounds right after another alot. Then you could not switch fast enough to pull it off.

But you do not need the synth engine having samples. Nord does provide free synth samples for their NE3 and NW users.If you need to have a synth, a killer combo would be pairing the NE3 with a mopho keyboard and later expand it with a Tetra.

You can also manually control the speed change in the rotor by using morph. Hope this answers your question.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=59&sid=6b77c4bd59138bb0f093b2587ffd08f1#p59
