So instead of using the stop-mode and the cathedral organ you can use a drawbar-setting for the first part:(7-4-8-2-4-4-2-0-0) and morph this with the wheel to (8-4-8-6-4-6-2-2-4); crank up the drive up to half and set the leslie to slow.Then using a Yamaha-Piano (Studio Grand) like Mr. Martin and a little bit of string-sound... (I split the keyboard, to get the ""only-piano-area"" for the notes at the end of the chorus (Split-point at F4).It's hard to hear if the organ is played at that area or an octave lower so I used a second organ-solt with the same settings only one octave higher... and for the lazy ones I utilize the tramspose-button (1 semitone up) so you can play it in D...I will post my version in the next days.RegardsTim",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=184469&sid=dccaa0ccbb57cb78dafb378e35708568#p184469

I cover how to do it with the Control Pedal atviewtopic.php?t=25933and you can take the same approach with Aftertouch.  It's easier and more flexible to bend notes with the pitch bar to learn the style as noted by DJKeys. Attached is a pedal steel sample if you want to try it with an amp model and drive. Depending on the sound you're looking for, sometimes a sawtooth wave can be used instead of a sample, and adding reverb and a little delay helps as well. I hope that helps, good luck.__pedalsteel.nsmp(3.6 MiB) Downloaded 32 times",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=182996&sid=dccaa0ccbb57cb78dafb378e35708568#p182996

There are a few versions of the song including the very nice one below sung by Tauren Wells.  The MP3 demo is a different version of ""Echo"" with me playing over top of a video of Montage programs.  My programs cover this version, but the ""Intro"", ""Verse A"", and ""Chorus"" programs work well with Tauren Wells' version as well. The Verse B program with the phase shifter on pads is only needed for the alternate version of ""Echo"" as played in the MP3.On the MP3 I start briefly with ""Echo Intro W.ns4p"" and then move to ""Echo Verse A  W.ns4p"" that uses Synth A with a DX-type sound that can be modified as needed. Synth A doesn't use sustain so the other two synths with sustain can drone through. In Layer Scene II, synth B with an arpeggiator and an acoustic piano are added.  The MW raises the Filter Freq of the pads and level of synth B.___The attachmentEcho Intro     W.ns4pis no longer availableThe attachmentEcho Verse A   W.ns4pis no longer available""Echo Chorus W.ns4p"" has analog and sampled brass left of the split with vibrato on the Mod Wheel, and a mono synth on the upper split using AfterTouch.

For example, using the program by jayr007, I assigned synth A as mono with high note priority and synths B and C as mono with low note priority, and then overlapped all three synths over the same zone. Layer Scene 1 uses synth B and C, and Layer Scene 2 adds Synth A. While playing the B3 with the left hand, the right hand can cover both parts playing two notes, the lower being the DX1 and the upper being the DX7. It takes a little practice playing the parts cleanly, but it works well.

Pedal control could be the answer?ThanksIf you want to keep the DX7 mono synth, there are a few possibilities depending on how you want to play it as the transitions are pretty quick. In order to move to a polyphonic DX7 from mono mode, it would be easiest to simply switch to a 2nd program, but you could also not use high-priority mono for the DX7, letting the low note double the DX1, and adjust levels with the CP.  As another option, consider sampling your DX1 sound (synths B and C), so the DX1 sound could be on a single synth; you could then use a mono high-priority DX7 for the second synth with the DX1, and a polyphonic DX7 for a third synth on the verses on the upper split.

A post on Facebook prompted me to find a solution to being able to smoothly change the synth pitch with morphing.On the NS4, the pitch menu allows semitone tuning and fine tuning, however both parameters are not morphable. The user on Facebook was able to change the pitch in semitones using an external MIDI controller as a workaround.Messing around with the Oscillators ""Pitch to Env"", I found I could morph the ""Env Amt"" to get a smooth pitch bend down (or up). I created a Synth Preset with the highest-note mono synth set with a negative Env Amt and morphed to zero with the Control Pedal. Backing off the CP will drop the pitch.As the OSC pitch follows the OSC Env Decay, the morph becomes less effective the longer a note or chord is held, so the OSC Env Decay time is currently set just below infinity at 43 seconds for best results. I believe there is a bug with the infinity setting as the initial pitch jumps dramatically and the sound moves to the 0 setting when I would think it should take ""forever"" to move from the OSC Env Amt setting to 0 (infinity seconds). I've posted the bugherewith a video.While the pitch stick bends the pitch uniformally across all selected instruments, the pitch bend with the morph can be different for each synth. In MP3 demo 1, two synths use my ""W Env2Pitch"" preset with mono turned off, and one synth has the initial Env Amt set slightly different so the two synth pitches move further apart as the Control Pedal is backed off and then come together at max (Env Amt = 0). In MP3 demo 2, both synths are set for mono and a third synth is added for the chords.  The synth preset can be easily changed for any analog wave or sample.  I hope you like it, take care.NS4 Program Example - Env to Pitch 1 W.mp3NS4 Program Example - Env to Pitch 2 W.mp3UPDATE:Leaning toward the idea that folks will learn more by doing, I removed my posted preset after about 500 downloads.

Start with the easiest way, dial in a synth layer - analog typ, wave - pure saw and tweak the amp env (short attack, quick decay, medium release); a little delay and a velocity-controlled amount of opening for the filter. The rest of filter-opening can be done by assigning it to a pedal/wheel...The second sound can be reproduce with a square-based sound (PURE SQUARE).As third sound I would recommend a mixture with a Rhodes (with little Vibe-FX) and choir and a huge amount of reverb (thanks to the new cathedral-verb...).After finding the sounds I use the copy&paste-function to assembe all layers in one program.All three sounds can be layed out (3-times-split) like this:bottom (whole mps3-song) - first sound (bass)middle (0:31 -end) - third sound (pad)top (sec. 0:11 - 0:32) - second sound (melody)I attached my quick version of this song-specific preset and the (not-well live played) hook-lines as mp3... - hope you like it...CheersTimOmvender.ns4p(868 Bytes) Downloaded 1485 times",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=178859&sid=101daf84d36b8aea9d974df68939d032#p178859

For this song it also sounds likes it’s coupled with a decent amount of Drive on the Leslie (maybe 3.0, between 3 & 4?) That will give you some of those really cool overdriven harmonics. That should give you your basic sound for much of the song (Verses and interludes.)As for the Choruses and ending vamp, I’d say it’s actually Str8 you want to add to the fundamental.

No doubt that the Electric and Acoustic Pianos are amazing and the Lead Sounds seem to be a little better than in the Nord Stage 3 which I previously owned, but in comparison to my old trusty Yamaha Motif Rack XS  I have trouble to find anything in the factory Lead Presets which I like. I play mainly 80s Jazz Rock. So I am looking for classic 80s Lead Sounds.I would really like to do everything with my Nord Stage 4 without the need to use the Motif Rack, but it is the same problem as before. Samples are still not velocity sensitive in the NS4 and I don't know any commercial Preset Seller who really offers High Quality Programms for the Nord Stage.I have to say that I am not convinced of the quality of for example certain websites who seem to be selling partly old NS3 Samples as ""new"" NS4 Samples. I don't want to offend nobody. So I don't want to name any concrete website. I just get a strange feeling if I see a demo video for some ""brand new"" NS4 sounds and the guy is using a Nord Stage 3...There might be websites who offer High Quality. After a lot of searching until now I have only found one website with sounds which are without doubt High Quality which is narfsounds. His 80s sound set is very nice!https://www.narfsounds.com/nord-stage-4Maybe I am wrong and one has to spend more time to optimize the raw samples with the effects and the EQ of the NS4. On the other hand I remember a statement of the My Keys to Music Guy who said that a lot of the NS4 Synth Sounds are lacking High End and maybe also the right amount of Delay and or Reverb...Here in the forum I have found some Diamonds like for example the ""KurzPiano"" an amazing EPiano Sound. Because I was looking for an EPiano Sound which can be used with Pitch Bend. But as I said EPianos are not the problem. The problem are convincing Lead Sounds (a really Kick Ass distorted Electric Guitar Sound would be also nice) and I guess that the NS4 would be capable to do them. I am not such a big tweaker. I can maybe add a little bit of delay are EQ to a sample, but that's it. And it is nice that Nord offers Signature NS4 Sound Banks of great artists, but a lot of those sounds seem to be rather exotic and psychedelic. It is just not what I am looking for. In other words: I don't need another Neo Soul EPiano or nice atmospheric string sounds or whatever. There is already more than enough amazing Epiano Sounds and let's say cinematic sounds. That is not the problem.So is there maybe somewhere a collection of Lead Samples or NS4 Programm which I have overlooked? Thank you in advance. And just one more question.

I just would like to have a Program for every Preset Variation like for example in Keyscape. That's what I would call a systematic approach.I am unfamiliar with Keyscape. It appears that for each sample, they have built a bunch of different treatments/presets around the sample and they can copy/paste those by sample. Nord's approach with presets isn't quite the same. They don't create endless presets related to each individual sample. I believe that's probably a difference in approach between software based pianos in a computer and hardware based pianos in an instrument.If you want to hear what each Nord sample sounds like inside of a certain effects ecosystem, simply toggle through the samples and listen to them, tweak effects, etc. You'll figure out which sounds are best to your ears.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=177510&sid=101daf84d36b8aea9d974df68939d032#p177510

Buying programs saves time, but in my opinion that's time well spent if you are learning your way around the NS4. As the NS4 is new, there aren't many free programs posted yet with the NUF, however any user-created samples you find can be loaded for you to try out.  The search function works well if you are looking for particular songs.  Here's a link to get to over 70 samples I have posted:70+ Samples, and here's a post you should be aware of as well regarding conversion of older samples to NSMP4 format:Sample Converter.Good luck.Note: The Nord Sound Manager will now convert NSMP samples to NSMP4 format for the Stage 4, so the converter is not needed.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=165863&sid=101daf84d36b8aea9d974df68939d032#p165863

Patches are essentially the configurations that generate a particular sound or tone.A ""program"" is often used to describe a stored or selected patch on a synthesizer or keyboard. It refers to a specific sound or preset that can be recalled and played. Programs are usually organized and stored within a sound bank or memory location of the instrument.On the other hand, a ""preset"" usually refers to a factory-default or pre-installed program or patch that comes with the keyboard or synthesizer.

May have been different in the past.You probably know that a program is a sound configuration for your whole instrument, whereas a preset is meant to be a preconfiguration of settings in a section (piano, organ, synth). The meaning has slightly changed from NS3 to NS4 as the effects settings are now part of any preset (which wasn't the case with the NS3 that only had organ and synth presets). You know that you now have a preset library and can easily put together individual programs with presets from the different sections (from single and multi layer presets in case of the piano and the synth section, only dual layer in case of the organ section).If you know that a patch initially was a storable and/or selectable bunch of settings for a specific synth to represent a sound and is now used for a storable momentary configuration of multitimbral instruments, too, it is up to you what you mean by 'patch'. In my eyes, this is not a precisely defined thing in Nord context. Probably, most users will think of the modern (multitimbral) version of the meaning in the first place.

There is the NEW section in the sample library:https://www.nordkeyboards.com/sound-lib ... -40/latest. And there are posts on this forum. All this together may help a little.Aside from this you should know your samples - then you know what you miss and may look after. This won't happen from one day to another.Indeed there are two factory restore files: The newer with, the older without EP9 Stockholm. You can download both files, rename them to *.ZIP and watch the content; but you can't pre-listen. I wouldn't do it.Loading more programs is doable - individually or by bank. But you won't have more space for samples, so you need to delete others or replace/substitute them.There are also more piano samples than you can load - so what you will do with your instrument is shaping it to your own liking and needs. Deleting all programs and starting from scratch is absolutely OK, but not all users do it this way. It might be a solution to backup every program bank before. Anyway, you won't find the needed samples on your instrument anymore after a while of intense use. Of course you would be able to restore the factory sounds at some point; maybe save a copy for your needs.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=170445&sid=101daf84d36b8aea9d974df68939d032#p170445

The Sample Library list will show the NSMP3 samples loaded in your NS3 and how many programs are using them. Any user-created NSMP3 samples would have to be provided in the bundle and NSM will convert them to NSMP4 format. However, it's possible you are using some Nord NSMP3 samples that aren't yet available in NSMP4 format, and some new NS4 owners have had to sample their NS3 to cover those until Clavia updates their Sample Library.
