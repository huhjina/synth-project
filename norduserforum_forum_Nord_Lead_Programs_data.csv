I like more the style 70/80 ies.I was searching for the more soft, analog side of the A1.I bought it, because it is light. Good price for money. And I am a new user of the NS 3 compact. So have dont have two systems. Same thinking in these machines. Even there is a small A 1 in the NS 3 compact. And the key bed of the A 1 seemed first  to me a lttle bit plastic and too light. But after playing, I realized that it fits quite good for playing (fast) solo parts.I tested the DS Prophet 6, which is a very nice machine too, but high price and not so felxible than the A 1. Also I was looking for the Access Virus. But 3 octaves are not enough, and the 6 octave keyboard is too big for me.So the A 1 was over all the best choice for me.

One of the most used in the 90s was the ""Lately Bass"" patch on the TX81Z (Vogue, What is Love? and lots more)This patch is kindof inspired by that.With FM, one osc modulates the other, so OSC MIX is almost completely OSC1.

In the amp envelope apply a very short attack, decay somewhere in the middle, full sustain , release about 3 or 4. Use a low pass filter open (if not full, at least in a high setting).

They are very different synths. The prophet is much more versatile, in the sense that I have managed to emulate some sounds from my lead A1 on it, where I haven't had much succes the other way. The ""problem"" is that the lead A1 misses warmth. It is, however, much easier to get ""punchy"" sound from it, than from the prophet rev2. (with careful editing, you can also get punchy sounds from the prophet rev2 though).The A1 is great for live editing. I play, among other things, in a live jam-band, where we just play long sessions without much structure, so a lot of room for live experimenting. For that purpose, the Lead A1 is really superior to the rev2. It is also easy to actually get enough sound from it, where with the rev two I sometimes need a lot of effort to bring a sound created to the foreground.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=130856&sid=97afd44cba4d20a30fad26efe20ccf72#p130856

End of. So the question is, how close an approximation can you make, and will you be happy? That's subjective of courseWith that caveat in mind, the approach you need to take is to consider what characteristics the Juno has, and don't stray too far outside of those.- Consider there are two oscs, one saw, one square. You can have either, or both, but don't try anything else like 2 saws. Or, god forbid FM!- The subosc, which you can optionally add in varying degrees.- a lot of characteristic Juno sounds are done using PWM (control the pulse width of a square wave with a slow LFO). Be subtle.- Vintage gear generally has slower envelopes than modern VA, so dial back the attack a little.- Juno shares it's envelope with both the VCA and VCF, so consider that too. Don't use a filter envelope that is wildly different from your amp envelope.- Juno has chorus, and some natural analog slop. Not sure how this is best simulated on the A1, but Unison and detune will help here.Just general things, but maybe a steer in the right direction. Should be possible to make some Juno patches which are quite similar, but the Juno filter characteristics are very hard to copy even in synths that try specifically to do so.You could buy a Deepmind for not much $ and get a lot closer, or pick up a 106 for around £1000 (but you'll spend another big chunk keeping it serviceable over the next decade).There's my 2c. I only come here once or twice a year these days, so i'll probably miss the flame war from all those guys who've never even played a Juno",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=126483&sid=97afd44cba4d20a30fad26efe20ccf72#p126483

Connect a cable from MIDI Out on the transmitting device to MIDI IN on the Nord Lead 2X.2. If you are about to receive a complete Bank, you need to scroll to a number in the Bank (Program orPerformance Bank) you want to replace with the received Bank.3. Initiate the transmission on the transmitting device.If the dump contained a complete Bank, it will take the place of the selected Bank in the Nord Lead 2X.If the dump contained one Program/Performance only, this will be put in the “edit buffer” of the activeSlot, instead of the Program/Performance you were playing. However, it is not saved permanently. Tosave it, use Store as described on page 23 and page 35. Note that any Percussion Kits in a Performance,will only be included as “references” when you dump the Performance. If you want to dump PercussionKits including all parameters, you have to be in Program mode!so basically, after connecting your Lead 2X to your PC with a proper software (i use MIDI-OX) and setting the MIDI channels appropriately, you just have to ""Send sysex"" or the corresponding command on your software.The results will depend if you're in Program or Performance mode, and if you're sending a Program, Percussion Kit, Performance or an entire Bank.If you send a single program (or perc kit or performance) it will not be instantly stored: you will be able to audition it, modify it and if you like it, save it with the normal procedure.But if you send an entire Bank, it will immediately overwrite all the 99 programs in the current bank, so be careful to save your patches before!Also, note that only the first 4 banks of programs and the first bank of performances are overwritable (Program Banks 0-1-2-3, all the Percussion Kits and Performance Bank 0): all the others are fixed, you cannot save anything on those positions.Maybe your problem was that you were trying to save something in an unwritable position?Hope this helps, cheers!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=80296&sid=97afd44cba4d20a30fad26efe20ccf72#p80296

OSC2 is the modulator, and is always sinewave2. [OSC CONFIG] detunes OSC2 by half-tone ( between -2 and +4 octaves )3. [OSC CTRL] defines the FM amount from 0 to 100%4. [OSC LFO AMT] makes varying the FM amount by LFO5. [OSC MODENV AMT] makes varying the FM amount with parameters defined in MOD ENV=> meaning for creating FM sounds, we can work on FM amount and OSC2 tuning by half-tone.But, for exampleon a DX7, FM7, ...   we can fine-detune the Modulator of several 'percents of semi tones', which results on a slow vibrationthat makes the sound more rich and, lets say 'organic' / 'orgasmic' / or whatever :pSO SO my question is: it there a way ( or some 'magic cheat', why not? ) to get the same result on A1 ???Thanks for reading, and thanks for answering ; )",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=97047&sid=44a4018b3dd269758a9beba01771021c#p97047

I do not thing that your statement is correct.What has been said before is that with the NL4 you could produce many/most/all? sounds in the A1, but the reverse is not so.I do not think you can tune 2 different oscillators in the A1 like you can do in the NL4. If I am correct, the A1 slot has a hidden oscillator like the NS2 instead of a separate one. If so, that is not the same as you get locked to the same waveform and a limited range of detuning compared to the NL4.Doesn't that NL4 have ADSR envelopes, while the A1 are ADR EGs?1 LFO vs 2 LFOs?So obviously not the same.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=90915&sid=44a4018b3dd269758a9beba01771021c#p90915

The problem is that they're randomly placed among 10 banks with no logic or order and, without a decent screen and without Nord Sound Manager, it's really frustrating to find and use them. It's probably the only aspect in which the iconic 2X is really outdated.So I selected and organized my favourites in a single Program Bank, grouping them in categories so you have all pads together, all basses together etc.I then modified them to my tastes. I especially worked on velocity sensitivity (it's not easy to accurately use velocity on the Lead2X action, so usually I disabled it, or delegated its functions to the Mod Wheel, or used it as an on/off effect) and on using Morph to achieve nice effects, so remember to try out the wheel on most sounds.I wanted to have an easy to use, quick reference bank of general-purpose sounds, so you won't find very quirky experimental stuff in there.Please note I didn't try to accurately replicate acoustic instruments, this is a synth after all! So take the category names (pianos, brasses, strings etc) more as an indication of the generic type of sound.In attachment you have the whole bank in sysex format, and a pdf with the category and names of the 99 sounds.Hope you find it useful, please feel free to give feedback! This is my first ""serious"" attempt at sound design, so any criticism or comment will be useful.Have fun!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=86075&sid=d1da3336702b91bf47b3208d71ad4c8b#p86075

The filter - ladder. Named for its sets of paired transistors - is available in most Moogs ... and the NLA1!2. Dirt - the MiniMoog circuitry was far from perfect. Add some distortion to your patch. You got two sources on your NLA1. Use them.3. Square - ""it's hip to be"" ... you got two square waveforms to mix on your NLA1, add some unison (3) to get more detune.4. Some glide - the Moog is monophonic ... use the glide. You should practice using this a lot if you want to really nail the funk (I never practice).5. Bend over - use the wooden stick. It's much more exact on the NLA1 than the analog Moog. But practice. (Not me.)6. Legato - use it! This adds even more dynamics to your performance.OK, I'm not a funk player ... but these were ""facts"" I manage to find out. Please comment ...This is Mr Studnitzky of Funk Unit.

Maybe that is worth trying in the A1, given that you can overlap various slots. Perhaps you can experiment with making that 2nd oscillator to decay relatively quicker than the fundamental one.

Now AMOUNT knob will act as tremolo depth and RATE knob as speed.– Be sure your output is POLY and set the Wheel to affect the filter – It will control brightness.OSCILLATORS- Set OSC I to SINE.– Set OSC II to TRIANGLE, turn on KBD TRACK and tune it exactly like OSC I.– Put the FM on SYNC, so both oscillators will be tuned together, if you wanna try different sound you can put it on SYNC+RING MOD (the FM knob will just go crazy) don’t turn off sync or put it just on ring mod, it will trash your sound.– Turn the MIX knob so it will be around 85% OSC I and 15% OSC II. Pulse width knob is irrelevant since you’re not using any waveform that support it.AMP AND FILTER- Set AMPLIFIER envelope to: Attack = o, Decay= 80%~, Sustain = 0, Release = 0. (Recommended GAIN is 100%)– Set the FILTER TYPE to LP24db, put FREQ knob around 40%, zero RESO, and around 40% ENV AMT with the Velocity Button ON – it will make your sound, sensitive to how hard you play. The stronger you play, the brighter the sound.– Set the FILTER ENV the same as the AMPLIFIER, you may wanna try turning the ATTACK knob up to around 10-20% If you don’t want the sound to be clicky.I tried to follow his directions and it turned out pretty well ...
