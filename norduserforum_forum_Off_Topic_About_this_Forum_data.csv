Besides, there is a small forum I just recently found on:http://electro-music.com/forum/forum-166.htmlThis is why I decided to create a possibility more easily accessible for people potentially turned away by the fact that one has to have a Yahoo account to access this highly informative database.Moreover, I wanted to create the possibility to easily exchange and discuss (in particular with the possibility to discuss and include MP3 previews) user patches created for the Nord Stage. From my own experience, in particular the Synthesizer section -while obviously being less versatile than e.g. the Nord Lead, still provides enough tweaking possibilities to create basically anything one might want to use as sounds. Given that it takes time and effort to put a decent sound together, I thought this might encourage people to contribute their sounds and test other peoples'. The possibility of directly uploading your patch files and MP3 samples that are converted to be played back directly in the browser hould, I hope, encourage us to get the best sounds out of the Nord Stage.Given the highly increased traffic due to this forum I had to upgrade my webhosting account and plan to move this forum to its own domain if it really becomes a valuable resource.If you have and suggestion or comment, please post it here!Best,Johannes Emmerling",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=4702&sid=2f96fcba4fe7284e5f8abfe847152228#p4702

Kudos to all three who have been generously very active with around 200 posts in sharing their knowledge, providing assistance and making this community work!!other changes:In the Nord Stage Section, I introduced a ""Topic attribute:"" as [NS C/EX], [NS2] or [General] which should be set with each new thread in order to indicate whether it is a NS2 specific question, Classic/EX, or General NS thread. This way, I hope to avoid confusion given the substantial differences of the NS2. (I did not want to open a new forum since still many issues are the same). So please use these attributes to make it easier to help you out!The separation of NS Classic/EX and NS2 patches seemed to work well, given the incompatibility this hopefully improves accessibility of the patches.Also I added a google search function in the search page if you don't succeed with the standard search engine.Since I saw a couple of For Sale/Trade posts and had some requests for that, I created a new ""Garage Sales"" Section (http://www.norduserforum.com/buysell/) where you can post Sale/Trade/Buy Ads. So please if you have anything to buy/sell/trade, use this section only. This way, the forum should remain free from ads, for sale/trade offers or other commercial stuff.

I activated them just a couple of weeks ago given it is widely used (with the idea behind it of at least making a distinction between someone who just randomly has a question etc. or someone who somehow proved to be a supportive guy). But I get your pages allegory even though there are some differences.Actually, I thought of it more of a method to in some sense reward helping others out, or sharing patches, etc., but a pure post count is indeed a bit like book pages...Anyway, gave it another thought and removed them, in particular since I don't like hierarchies very much and maybe the stars did insinuate something like this.Basically, I always do things kind of ""into the blue"" 'cause you never know what people want, so I am happy about your constructive criticism, always good if the ""blue"" speaks back;-)December 11th, 2011:Updates:Youtube Videos can now more easily embedded also with full linksBuy & Sell Section updated to make it more user friendly and photo upload easier.Spam Cleanup finished",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=4754&sid=2f96fcba4fe7284e5f8abfe847152228#p4754

I was tickled to find, though I haven't seen a lot of evidence of people opening up their Stage 3's yet (something about a warranty), Nord makes sturdy workhorses. I found they're easy to repair.I do embedded software for work. I like opening up my devices and understanding them deeply. I love the way Nord makes the interface - everything is right out in front of you. It seems very well thought out to me. I want to tinker around inside just to appreciate the elegance I can already sense is in there. (I haven't, but imagine an upgraded Stage 3 with ... I'll stop!)I read the request to Nord to make a better Nord Sound Manager or Nord Sample Editor. That was good to see, both because it saved me trouble, and because it gives me something on the software side to tinker with, which keeps me from opening up the piano itself...But I don't know, I don't want to go all wild, reverse engineering the .nsmp3 format. I like Nord. I wouldn't want to go head-to-head against them.Maybe the day will come, when their next product launches using a different DSP architecture and they end support for the old Nord Sample Editor or something (they have only so many engineers plus legacy support inevitably falls to the community anyway)...

Got my first Dizzy LP as a gift from the school band leader. Took me some years to love it. Switched the attitude towards the piano about 10 years ago and decided to develop a jazzy pop style - no classics on my piano any more (classics now is Randy Newman or Billy Joel for me, preclassics is Cole Porter or so). Meaning going from hobbyist to job related low level commitment. Which means I just play that style on single occasions in my parish and around.Now started as a keyboarder in a modern Big Band - which implicated the need for some synth sounds for the first time. But am still committed more to EP sounds, want to fathom their potential. As well as Hammond sounds. And try to figure out harmonies/scales.Music is not my only hobby, but with the purchase of my Stage 3 Compact, it's a decision to go back to taking it seriously. And professionally, I'm convinced that we still have to develop more into the pop world in old world protestantism. As much as I love classical organ music on sunday morning (and we pay a lot for those instruments!) - but shouldn't be the only sound.That should be enough for the public side. If any journalist would have the need to know more, he/she can ask - I'm a regional public relations agent as well. But at the moment, in my eyes it's not worth the effort.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=128244&sid=2f96fcba4fe7284e5f8abfe847152228#p128244

Like a number of members here, I’m also a guitarist. My formal musical training is in piano and largely self taught on guitar -which I’ve been playing since junior high school (around 14 yrs of age). I’m retired at 66 (67 next month) and have played professionally in the past for many years mostly as a keyboardist. I still have one remaining memento from those days as you can see from some photos I’ve posted here -a Hammond C-3 organ and Leslie 122 which is also retired and permanently installed in my living room. I’ve lived in various parts of the world some as a child with my parents but others as an adult including my current residence in the U.S. Territory of Guam which I’ve lived the longest and liked the best. The photo in my profile pic is my current setup but here are some photos related to the other musical side. The last two instruments from a past collection of many guitars.

Seit 3 Monaten habe ich nun mein Stage 3. Vorher hatte ich ein Kawai MP 7SE. Das Teil war mir aber zu klavierlastig. Nun habe ich auf dem Stage 3 eine relativ gute B3, das musste ich vorher über den PC (VB 3 für 120 €) laufen lassen.Als erstes habe ich mich an einen Umbau rangemacht, da ich von Beruf Elektroniker bin ging das . Hat aber ne Menge Arbeit gemacht, 2 -3 Tage. Schalter Ein/Aus zusätzlich, da der originale hinter dem Notenpult ist, und wenn das Teil an der Wand steht, ist das echt lästig. Zwei 230V-Steckdosen, eine USB-Doppeldose für Lampe und Handy/Pad und eine 9V -Buchse für's Pedal.

For 3 months I have now my Stage 3. I had a Kawai MP 7SE before. But the part was too piano to me. Now I have a relatively good B3 on the Stage 3, I had to run in advance about the PC (VB 3 for 120 €). Finally, I have myself to a rebuilding ranking, since I am an electronics technician by profession. But has made a lot of work, 2 -3 days. Switch on / off In addition, as the original is behind the music desk, and when the Board is on the wall, that's really annoying. Two 230V sockets, a USB double socket for lamp and mobile phone / pad and a 9V jack for the pedal.

Which i also love and after many years of working i invested all my money (and i still investing) in sound and light equipment for live event's ( i own a small sound and light rental company )All these years working from small kid i was near real proffesional musicians and sound technician which helped me a lot.. and later i studied sound engineering and got my degree. And i always look forward to have friends real experienced - proffesional sound enginers and musiciansThis way i improve always becoming better..I said all these about the sound just to let you know that anything you need about sound equipment and specialy the live gig events etc  e.g equipment which ones are good or the best. Which di boxes cables or how you will route what cables you will use. Speakers etc.. you can feel free and ask me . I will gladly help youNow to the nordfrom when i was a kid i loved the piano for me is the king of all music instruments because of the polyphony.. but i never had the chance and time to study or start learning some piano cause i first loved my basic starting instrument bouzouki..So when i first heard a nord piano i loved it and i had to buy one for my sound and lights company.. this purchase was the best motivation to start playing also.. i bought ofc the most asked instrument for rental the nord stage 3 88 ha..I play now 8 months and i am able to play and sing alone for almost 2 hours non stop in my live events. Ofc my playing skills are just decent and not real pro .. with my little experience on piano i can understand and feel that this fatar keybed of stage 3 88 ha is kind of cheap.. and not very good for piano action feel and ofc isnt worth that much money.. after paying that much i expected a better keybed and not a keybed that used in 1000$ Price range stage pianos .. i am planning to buy a nord grand but i wait a bit because i believe they will release a new nord grand 2 or a new stage 4..",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=149132&sid=2f96fcba4fe7284e5f8abfe847152228#p149132

Is it just me, or do others also see that issue?Perhaps many more threads are affected as well?Hi,I saw the topic and compared the topics, and all posts are there.Note the table layout has changed, and I manually adjusted all tables to the new format (which is basically a simple markup with pipes and line characters |--| etc.You can check it in your post to easily adjust it in case.Anyhow, all posts are there.Hope it looks fine to you too.Great initiative btw!cheers johannesHi johannes,Thanks, and thank you for updating the table layout! The posts may be there indeed, but I edited the first and second post quite considerably, and those changes are gone. Also user Spider deleted his post, which now seemed to have reappeared. I made those changes Thursday 25th of April in the evening CET. Should I edit the posts and make the changes manually again, or is the latest version of the thread hanging around somewhere?Cheers!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=174892&sid=2f96fcba4fe7284e5f8abfe847152228#p174892

It's normal if one or two mess up so can still catch up. Bear in mind this was about a 12 piece band with strings, percussion, rhythm but NO ONE resumed playing.

Lots of people are, and that’s understandable.I wasn’t seeking recognition or adulation.  I don’t need to be the center of attention, and I was looking for similar people.I wasn’t looking for a way to relive my errant youth.  Yes, we all had a blast when we were younger, but that was then and this is now.I wasn’t looking for a friendly place to intoxicate myself.  I don’t like playing with intoxicated musicians.I wasn’t looking for a social club for bored retirees.  Where I live, there are a lot of people looking to get out of the house.I wasn’t interested in group therapy sessions.  We all have issues we want to work on, but not here.  Same for politics, religion, etc.I wasn’t looking to recreate School of Rock for beginning musicians.  We all want to get better at our craft, but I’ve been playing continuously since a young age, played in a bunch of different bands, informally studied music theory and history, etc.  I don’t suck.  If you’re a 4.5 at tennis, you want to play with similar players most of the time.  Actually, it would be great to have a tennis-style rating system for musicians!”I’m in the place where I’m thinking of joining or starting a band again (it’s like a 7 year itch for me and it’s been 10 years).

It must have been in my childhood that I last saw part of a show.In my country, the public discussion usually is if at least the public or even the audience takes the contest seriously. I don't know that type of musicians that would care. As there are about 180 mio spectators every year - from Europe, western Asia and northern Africa - it has to be taken seriously from the business side. A certain type of professional composers and producers seem to take it seriously as well.Maybe you need to know that the juries' vote is only 50% - the rest is televoting by the audience. Social media may play a big role. Besides, it's all about national public broadcasting corporations launching their candidates (via jury or televoting or any other way) and juries at the same time, letting them pass through semifinals with nationally separated televotings and collecting votes from other nations in the finals - neither national jury nor audience is allowed to vote for the own country. Acts need to be new, original and semi-playback, aren't allowed to contain a political message in a controversial sense, but don't need to be in the country's language any more (from 1999). As public voting plays a big role and you need to collect points from a lot of countries, a winner act has probably passed a severe test in mass taste and intercultural suitability. I have my imagination what sort of quality statement this is.After 1991, a lot of countries from eastern Europe (including Russia) joined the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as the organiser of the contest. A few years later, a new rule offered the candidates of the Big Five (Germany, France, Britain, Spain and Italy) a wildcard. Sounds like a business driven decision, too.After some years with full public voting, juries are back in the process since 2008. Their members are meant to have 'some relation' to music or the music business. But there have nevertheless been issues with corruption in the past - the last one I know of through the jury of Georgia.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=165581&sid=2f96fcba4fe7284e5f8abfe847152228#p165581

Trademarks are a different story.Right, you can't copyright ""a sound"", but you can copyright ""a recording.""  Once a recording is copyrighted, you can't use someone else's copyrighted recordings mixed in with other stuff and forget the original copyright.  (Much to the dismay of people who use samples in music.)  There is a limit: if you change the recording enough so that it dramatically changes the character, you can escape copyright claims.  But I doubt that embedding re-recorded piano note samples to make a copy digital instrument would pass that test.Clearly, music instrument manufacturers claim that you can't do this.  But as I mentioned above, they often make claims that aren't legally supportable (just like, back in the old days, we used to sign leases that had unenforceable clauses.)But in this case, I think that Yamaha is on good legal footing, and that if I sampled a digital piano and distributed the samples, they'd have a valid claim against me.The protection that sampled instruments get from copyright laws like the US's DCMA is an accidental legal benefit.  The laws weren't intended to protect instrument manufacturers.  For example, there's nothing in there to prevent you from sampling your real grand piano (or your Harley Davidson motorcycle) and using that to make a software instrument.  What it does cover is ""sound recordings"" which is exactly what samples are.  So, DP manufacturers are covered, mostly as an unintended consequence.A fuzzier area is modeled instruments.  My suspicion is that any company's legal team and marketing team would have very different ideas on whether an instrument was sampled or modeled.  I bet if someone created a software piano based on what is marketed as a ""modeled piano"", the legal team would say, ""Yeah, but it's sampled too.""  But if it's demonstrable that the instrument truly is modeled and not based on samples with modeled ""extras"", then copyrights would not provide any protection.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=165063&sid=2f96fcba4fe7284e5f8abfe847152228#p165063

My wife and me gonna marry this year in summer.I'm  looking for a pianist to play ""Love Me Like You Do"" on the piano as we walk down the aisle, one option is of course to hire a professional pianist who is experienced in playing wedding music. I already know that many professional pianists have a repertoire of popular wedding songs that they can play, and they may be able to learn a specific song like ""Love Me Like You Do"" if you request it in advance, but my wife wants a special version of it to be played that you can find here:https://pianoholic.co/love-me-like-you-do-pianoDo you have an idea how to get the sheet music for this track? Another option is to ask a friend or family member who is a skilled pianist if they would be willing to play the song for our wedding, but they said it's to complex ( unfortunately I can't play the piano). I'm willing to pay the full cost of hiring a professional pianist but I need ideas about how to get the sheet music.Thank you!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=159538&sid=2f96fcba4fe7284e5f8abfe847152228#p159538

Unfortunately I live in a small village and the few pianists that are here don't have the software to create the piano sheet for this song and they need it to play it.

Should anyone want to try what I did -- or perhaps give their existing band leader some helpful suggestions -- you might this useful.The reason that I am starting a thread is that I'm hoping others can contribute.This is a bit long, and meant to serve as a reference for others.------------------------------------------------------------------------------To start with, like others I have been in many bands over the years: some good, some trying to be good.  I have seen what can work and what doesn't.  I partially retired two years ago, so had the time and inclination to put more effort into making music.There are plenty of band acts locally, none of which I would make an effort to go see, several of which that I find annoying to listen to, so I leave if they're playing.  There is ample audience and plenty of venues.  I live in a beachside retirement community, so also plenty of happy retirees (or near-retirees) who like to come out to hear good music.  I have seen them light up and really enjoy things if you get the music right for their ears.Over time, I got a clear image in my head of what sort of band the local crowd would make an effort to come out and hear.It should be fronted by two strong vocalists, going back and forth.  The material should be drawn from the mid-60s through the early 80s, and cover great songs that other bands don't want to tackle.  No loud anything: guitar, drums, etc.  Don't get locked into any genre or band style.  Great vocals up front, a really tight band supporting them, going from cool song to cool song and resulting in a thoroughly entertaining experience for our target demographic.I studiously wanted to avoid a genre label.  I don't want to be easily labeled dance band, tribute band, party band, wallpaper band, crappy covers band, island band, etc.  We will pander a bit with certain tunes (e.g. Mustang Sally, Sweet Caroline) within reason, and if the pay is good.  If we cover an overly familiar tune, it'll be in an interesting way you haven't heard before.Someone in the audience should go home thinking ""gee, that was great to see all those songs done that way"".""Band vision"" is very important when you recruit others.  Every good musician you meet will have strong ideas about the type of band and music they want to play -- and how they want to play it.  That's all well and good, but I need them to buy into my vision -- at least to some degree -- to make progress.Without a clear, agreed vision up front  -- and one that you will need to remind people of -- problems can result down the road.Fortunately, I had a core of great folks from the last band, including a wonderful female vocalist.  I got them all saying the same words that I was using regarding vision, etc.  When we went to recruit outside, we could be very clear about what we were looking for, why we were looking for it, expectations, etc.The other thing I found I had to be very clear on is -- what was the goal of the band?  What does good look like?  I started with the big goal:we all had to have a blast doing this, or it wasn't going to work.  If it isn't fun for everyone, no amount of money, ego boost, etc. was going to compensate.So that meant Job #1 for me was to make sure everyone was really enjoying the band experience -- band and audience included!Now, if you're a process person like me, maybe step back and think about all the things that could be done to make a band experience more enjoyable for everyone?It's quite a list:* a nice rehearsal place: clean, safe, great-sounding, PA ready to go, fridge, bathroom, parking, etc.* killer, ear-candy mix for everyone at rehearsals* considerable prep ahead of the rehearsal: agreed songs, lead sheets, calendaring, keeping track of progress* clear communication: work to do, decisions to be made, next steps, encouragement and enthusiasm, etc.* ""performance infrastructure"": PA, lights, monitors, sound person, transport, etc.* producing and assembling promo stuff: photos, audio, logos, facebook page, etc.* keeping an eye on personalities and interactions, stepping in if there's a disruptive issue.* and, finally, getting quality gigs -- but not too many, as we all have other lives to live.If the band experience is not enjoyable for everyone, you will know quickly.  And that causes bands to lose members, break up, etc.  None of that happens if everyone is having a blast.  No one wants to end the party!  To be fair, there are some people who can't be happy regardless, so they move on.So, maybe I can expand on the topics above.I bought a dedicated rehearsal house here when such things were much less expensive.  We did a bit of rehab to it to make it secure and functional, but little else.  I'm not worried about someone damaging something.  People leave their stuff, set up, ready to go. This was a serious investment in my music happiness, and it has paid off.  No place to play, no music, no fun, etc.  When I sell it, I will do quite well financially.  No one pays rent, this is my contribution.  The run rate is quite modest.The music house is set up with personal monitors (or IEMs) for each musician station.  I use an X-Air 18 and the P16-M units to deliver a custom mix to each monitor.  Rehearsals sound GREAT as a result as everyone plays at a moderate volume, then cranks up their personal unit to get the mix they want.  We record every rehearsal simply by plugging in a laptop.  Bring extra disk storage, or have a big internet pipe to take everything to the cloud.The core of the band (vocalist, keys, drums, bass) is very talented, and could be a decent act on its own.  Add tasty guitars, a killer male vocalist and a sax player for sizzle -- and it's quite the lineup.  Finding good people is always hard, but when you have something great to offer them, it gets that much easier.The prep work was considerable, and still is.  For each rehearsal, I have to figure out where we are in the process, choose 10-12 songs we want to work on, make sure they are notated correctly, find example videos, then distribute and nag a bit.  I run rehearsals 70/30 -- 70% real work, 30% trying out new songs, new arrangements, etc.This last 30% has turned out to be very important.  This is where band members can suggest a song, show us something they've worked out, have us listen to a different version, etc.  People will send me links to videos, things they've recorded, etc. and I will play them out over the PA so everyone can hear and comment together.This is an important component of ""fun"" as we're done with work for the night, beers are being opened, lots of social chatter, etc.  Also, people are heads down when it's 70% time as a result, knowing what's coming later.Our female vocalist is also a successful real estate broker.  She is in charge of getting gigs, and it turns out she can get as many as we want.  She walks in, asks who is in charge, and then turns on the charm full blast.  No one has said no yet. This has brought up a discussion around what kind of gigs do we want, how many, what's our minimum, how do we feel about charity work, etc.Remember, it's all about fun, not money -- we established that way up front.  Example: someone will want to get paid more for a gig, so others will volunteer their share because they want to play the gig.  Objecting person will quickly withdraw their objection.Our drummer also has good audio and video recording skillz, and a network of friends.  The bass player knows a retired professional sound engineer who also records and who's great.  It takes a village, so we've got ours.I am captain of the ship, but am nothing without my crew.  I definitely have firm opinions on many topics, but mine is not the only one.  I give plenty of room for discussion, debate and consensus building.  I make absolutely sure I don't get my way all the time.We are now exactly 8 weeks from our first big concert-style gig.  Facebook is alive with buzz, and people making plans to see us.  This makes me think we have a real band on our hands.Mindset has been important.  Yes, this is ""my band"", but I see my role as a facilitator for others so they can enjoy their experience.  In doing so, I'm having a blast.  If I stop having fun, I'll stop doing it.----------------------Diving a bit deeper on the content producing process now: setlists, arrangements, etc.Speaking as a process design guy, this is an interesting one.  Each musician starts with a list of songs that appeals to them, including me, as I've been in a ton of bands and know what's worked well in the past.  I also know what can be done well live, and what might require a studio's worth of gear.Since we're a vocals band, we start with what the singers want to sing.  Slower stuff goes in the opening set, and so on.  About a third of their choices didn't make the cut for one reason or another.  Next, non-vocalists start suggesting stuff.  Some of it is the usual easy jammy stuff people like to play, so let's do some of that if the vocalists can make it interesting.This results in a three-part list which I continually update and publish back to the band:* Songs we've all agreed belong on the setlist.  These get full-boat treatment: full-notation, detailed arrangements, change keys to suit vocalists, etc.* Songs we've tried, but are not sure will make the setlist.  We will play these a few more times, and then decide whether to promote them to set list status, or not.  Songs can live here a good long time.  As they get promoted, other songs get demoted.* Songs that someone would like to try.  We find a youtube that's somewhat similar to what we're aiming for, send it around with a few notes on key and tempo, and then give it a try during ""fun time"" at rehearsal.You can see what's happening here.  Any band member can suggest a song, and it will get full consideration. We aren't investing a lot of time to do this, and it keeps it fun.  Everyone has a voice.  The setlist will naturally morph from gig to gig this way.  As I look at our current setlist (too long!), I can see contributions from everyone.------------Personal perspective commentary, e.g. why am I doing all of this?  Why don't I just do something else that's easier?Quick answer: because I've tried all those alternatives (and maybe a few you haven't thought of) and it's ultimately not satisfying.I want to play great music live with an awesome band in front of a great audience.  Since I couldn't find that gig (well, not without touring), I ended up deciding to try and put together one of my own.  I did the homework on the demand side of the equation.  I knew what people would want to see, because I would want to see it.Circumstances were right, all the prep and investment work had already been done, etc. -- so the gap turned out not to be all that big.--------------------------Small update on rehearsal structure?We have the usual once-a-week group rehearsals, but now another layer is spontaneously developing.  The vocalists want their own vocals rehearsals, sans band.  The guitarists now want to rehearse signature parts together, separately.  The vocalists are heading out of town for some time, so the instrumentalists are going to arrange some killer jams for those parts.All of this is happening rather spontaneously, helped along because there's a dedicated place to go do it that makes it easy, etc.That's all for now!-- Chuck",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=146929&sid=ccfe3e34caf93995f6c2d4c331785a0f#p146929

There are plenty of other sites for that.Let's see if we keep talking how it affects us without getting into politics.I really don't care about politics.But the strategy to limit the spread is very interesting, not least for us musicians.Sweden hasn't locked down, but told it's citizens to avoid meeting people if it's not necessary, not travel far, not sit close to each other anywhere public, avoid public transportation.Stores have created distancing floor markings for people to keep distance, put up plastic screens for cashiers to sit behind, etc.Workplaces where it's possible to work from home are encouraging to do that, which most of us are. (My work place has a parking lot of about 500 cars, which is usually full. Now it's ca 20 cars there.)I think most people are following the rules and guidelines quite well, but there are exceptions. Some don't care, and some don't understand. As always.Musically I think it's about 50/50 between those that still rehearse, and those that avoid rehearsing so to avoid spreading.No gatherings of 50 persons or more are allowed, so all gigs are off.No politics in this (and as said above, let's not get into politics) - just wanted to give an idea what's going on, as it seems Sweden has been a lot in the world news lately.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=131280&sid=ccfe3e34caf93995f6c2d4c331785a0f#p131280

We had a couple of incidents during the last 2-3 weeks here in Germany, where small crowds lead to new infections:several baptist church eventsseveral ""it's more than time to re-unite in our restaurant"" disastersa flat with about 600 inhabitants related to a religious event.New York City made similar experiences, don't need to tell you.In short: bring together enough people and one infectious one, and thing become worse again. The city with the flat is close to a lockdown again; schools are already closed there again for 2 weeks, out of the blue. As a side effect, one HRM-manager attended said restaurant events ... and took the whole management team of a shipyard into quarantine as a result.So, especially in the USA, I think people, like audiences, shouldn't take the situation light-hearted.

This notice is perhaps overdue, but personal and general worldwide circumstances have delayed this post.This is a general notice that I am no longer working as Nord Tech Support for either Canadian or US wholesale distributors, effective May 1, 2020.  Folks in Canada and the USA seeking tech support will be directed to my former colleague, Matthew Wood.  He is a caring and competent individual, but under current circumstances is carrying a significantly heavier load with responsibility for numerous other gear brands as well as Nord, so it may be that the concierge-level service to which some have become accustomed is no longer available.  Please note that this is a function of the Canadian and US wholesalers and not a situation over which our friends in Sweden have any direct control.  Working with the Nord brand generally and with our friends in Sweden specifically for the past ten years has been one of the major blessings of my life and I am grateful for having had the opportunity to serve in that capacity.Going forward it is my hope that I will be able to spend more time with my synth collection actually playing and producing music, subject to the competing demands of my wife and her ""honey do"" lists.  That said, I have amassed a large collection of Nord, and other, instruments over the years, many of which are now redundant to me.  There were purchased in order to have on hand in case I needed to field detailed inquiries about those models.  I have begun the process of taking photos and creating listings on REVERB.COM under my shop, ""Pablo Mastodon's Synth Extravaganza.""  Everything I sell will have gone through meticulous QC process by me prior to listing.What I'm keeping: NS3-Compact, NW2, NW, NR2X, NLA1R, NL4 (or NR4, haven't decided which yet), C2D, G2E, G2, NR3, MicroModular.What will become available (some of which listed already): NER2, NMK, NMR, NR1, NSEX-Compact, G2X, G2E, NR4 (or NL4?)This forum remains, to me, a shining example of the best that the internet can be and offer.  As I have said many, many times to countless people, it is populated by friendly and helpful people.

Even for those exceptions, we could only go alone, with face masks, and -if at all possible- on foot and no more than 500 mts from home.From today the confinement rules have been relaxed, we're at least allowed to move by car and go to visit relatives, and many commercial and industrial activities are reopening.Still, all aggregation activities remain banned for the foreseeable future: museums, theatres, cinemas, festivals and of course gigs. Bars and restaurants will reopen with strict distancing rules (sitting only, no patrons at the counter, at least 2 meters between tables, no people socializing outside, etc). Most gig venues in my town are small clubs, bars and restaurants which will have BIG problems in running their activities profitably with 1/3 or less of the patrons.

Since I'm burning things anyway tonight and not able to sleep (approaching 5am here), I guess I might as well throw another log on the fire:There comes a time when one must speak one’s conviction.  For me that time has now arrived with the latest bit of bile spewed by the one whose name used to be DRUMPF.Some may feel that this is not an appropriate forum for this, and perhaps there is an aspect of validity to that view.  However, I have read the forum rules three times and not found any prohibition of this sort of post.  It is not my intention to conduct any lengthy thread discussion about this, only to make this one public statement of my mind, and to invite others to do the same.  My personal conscience demands this.  I will not comment further on this thread, but applaud those whose sympathies are in alignment with my own.  To those of opposite opinion, cast aside the layers of brain-washing propaganda you’ve been consuming for too many years and wake up to reality.I remember well the choruses of “love it or leave it” commonly spouted 50 years ago around Vietnam War protests.  It is sometimes said that those who ignore history are destined to repeat it.  And now we are hearing the echoes of the same thing half a century later.Of the four women being asked to 'go back where you came from,' three were born in the USA.  The fourth emigrated to the USA as a refugee from a hostile, war-torn environment as a ten-year-old child.  My father emigrated to the USA as a refugee from a hostile, soon-to-be war-torn environment as a ten-year-old child.  So this feels somewhat personal for me.Accordingly, it is no longer possible for me to stand quietly by, keeping my personal thoughts to myself.  There is no possibility of normalizing this evil, no possibility of reconciling with it, no possibility of tolerating it.  The music which spoke to me in the 60's was protest music.  The music which called to me in the 70's was the music of racial, social and economic justice coming out of Jamaica.  It still does.  When one finds oneself with the instruments of influence, one is obligated to use it in a positive sense or pay the consequence.   Music and microphones are our instruments of influence.  Use them in a positive sense.  (respek due to Tony Rebel)In an earlier life I signed up to have my head shaven and to march around in a uniform carrying an M1.  Boot camp was a parade of yelling drill sergeants telling us that we were “lower than whale s***.” (presumably whale droppings fall to the very bottom of the ocean).  The ladder has not yet been made which is long enough for Drumpf to rise to that level.  By any measure, the fact of his ascendance in politricks has been and continues to be an unrestrained, unmitigated disaster of global proportions.  The repercussions of this will certainly continue to reverberate around the world for decades to come.  Each day seemingly brings a new crisis which dwarfs yesterday's bad news.The only hope for salvation is that this pendulum which has swung to this extreme will soon commence to overswing in the opposite direction to compensate.  This will not happen by itself.  Good things do not happen by accident.  They require the efforts of good people.  Therefore, I call upon all good people to do whatever you can, large or small, in this effort.  More than anything else, be not silent.  Make it happen.  The whole world’s watching.A war against hatred fought with more hatred will never be won.

Absolutely no reply should be given such comments and the thread should continue as if they were not there. That way we do not permit utter baloney to ruin a good and worthwhile conversation.If people persist in negative speech that is not productive or resulting in a suitable resolution or identified bug, it should be policy to permit at most one, relevant, statement per thread maximum and per forum if they are simply repeating the same argument across multiple threads.What say ye?",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=111363&sid=3fa470542a6295a13fb75c3ef78abc45#p111363

Korg Poly 61 and Yamaha DX7); these will either duplicate material on the track and/or add new textures/motifs.

You would have to use the original instrumental mix to do the phase-invert thing. Once you've got a workable isolated vocal track, then have at it with the creativity. Apart from anything else, it would be pointless to invest time and effort into making your own arrangement before you knew for sure that you were going to be able to have a workable isolated vocal track in the first place.[Remember, in Cubase you will be working non-destructively. What that means is that you will produce a new, third track containing only the vocal without altering the two original tracks in any way].The phase-invert trick only works if the two things are identical to each other in every respect, except of course for the stuff you want to keep.If you want to know how it works, here's a crude explanation:It works on the simple principle that +1 plus -1 equals zero.If you take your original track to be ""+1"", then the inverted track becomes ""-1"". Add the two together at equal volume, and you've got a result of zero - the two ""opposite"" tracks have perfectly cancelled each other out, leaving you - theoretically - with complete silence.Here's the clever bit - the vocal is only on ONE of the two tracks. So the inverted instrumental track does NOT invert the vocal (because there isn't any vocal) so NO inverted vocal is added to the original track. Thus the original vocal part is left untouched - hey presto.Edit: here's a video tutorial which explains how to do it:",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=69275&sid=3fa470542a6295a13fb75c3ef78abc45#p69275

Other sites in our group have been under almost constant attack from hackers trying to gain access and shut us down.In addition, we have not had a direct business case for keeping the forums active, so it seemed quite reasonable from an operations standpoint to discontinue them and not have to worry about hackers or other security issues.However, we agree with you all that we acted too fast.Regarding the future of the forums, we promise to either build a business case and implement another hardware and software solution, or find another business that would be willing to house the archives and continue the forums.We also promise to notify you in advance of any change in the status of the forums.Thanks for all your feedback.

Getting it back temporarily(WTF) is not really encouraging users to come back, missing business case OK fair enough but that insight cannot have come overnight, and security issues obviously serious topic but can be dealt with.

I'm waiting my turn to play it after this maestro goes to sleep. My older (2 years) son likes to ""wake up"" the drawbars. And then they go to sleep. Again. And again.A new game is also using the rotor speed indicator led as traffic lights when kids pass the keyboard with their cars and trucks. I liked the old NS classic style better, but now I'm waiting the yellow light to come on NS3. The kids are an ultimate test for how sturdy instrument can be.But seriously, I'm interested if people use Nord gear in teaching or educational purposes? Mostly the school instruments are more simple and cheaper, I've mostly seen Yamaha and Korg in schools with younger children. First Nords (stages) I saw was in my music university. I accidentally just found an unused Nord Rack 2 (i think) from their cupboard so they aren't in very efficient use... I saw NL in music technology storage room also! I know a few music-specialized high schools and special schools where they use NS or Electro.But I think Nord stuff could be great for teaching basics for examples organ drawbar stuff, basic synthesis, sampling and so on. Maybe not for the smallest kids, but from teenagers to elder people? Do you use your reds for teaching and how? Or do you know institutions or people who like to use Nord stuff for educational purposes? I know it's mostly the player's instrument on stage and the price is fairly high for institutes to fund. Also when basics of piano lessons can be mostly classical, people prefer acoustic pianos.Just curious how people use red stuff other than playing or as traffic lights!

While I don't hope to see any law suits in this area, it neither is a negligible issue. So here is a preliminary set of rules I thought maybe appropriate (I will include the final version of these rules in the FAQ):( Probably it would be best to define a license for the samples shared here suach as a certain type of Creative Commons License (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons), in particular the ""Attribution Share Alike (CC-BY-SA)"" License:(1) Users need to ensure that the license agreements that they agreed upon by buying a keyboard or software instrument is respected when creating samples. I think this is no issue when sampling from hardware instruments or creating patches without samples, but can be an issue if using VSTi's. For instance, see the following part in the End User Agreement of Native Instruments: (http://www.native-instruments.com/en/co ... nt/#c26349)The usage of this product (in particular samples, instruments and presets) for the creation of a sound library or as a sound library for any kind of synthesizer, virtual instrument, sample library, sample-based product or other musical instrument is strictly prohibited. Individual samples, sound sets or audio loops may not be distributed (commercially or otherwise) standalone. Furthermore these samples, sound sets or audio may not be repackaged in whole or in part as audio samples, sound libraries or sound effects.(2) Once a sample/patch is shared freely by uploading it to this website, it can be downloaded by anyone and used by all members and guests. This right includes using them as basis for your own sounds. Distributing and sharing them for free is allowed and encouraged whenever credit is given to the original creator.However, you areNOTallowed to sell patches or samples neither as an individual sample nor as part of a sample collection.(3) While the basic idea is that of free sharing, creating samples takes a lot of work. While sharing them for free allows everyone to free ride on this effort, it is understandable that active sharers (rare species, unfortunately, so it might need some protective measures) would like to get some kind of compensation if users find their work useful. Users on the other hand, might be willing to pay for a particular sample they need or including wanting to buy them, as there are many commercial samples available out thereTherefore a person who decides to share their creations here have two options:(a) include a link for voluntary donations via Paypal to your Paypal accountor(b) reference a link on a commercial website. In this case, the general rule about advertisements applies, i.e., this is possible only once per month per user in the forum or otherwise in the Buy&Sell section.If you have any comments please let me know.

IMHO it makes sense since a hardware instrument is not about the sample themselves but about effects, other hardware components such as sequencers etc., UI, .... while for VSTi the pure sample makes up for a much larger share of the overall product.As I stated in the forum rules, the free samples are for personal use only in that they are not allowed to be commercialized which makes sense. However, precluding ANY ""pro"" use would be strange IMHO (so you are allowed to do a freebie jazz thing or benefiz gig but would have to use a different sampleset for playing paying gigs).But I agree those IPR issues are in general complicated as you say depending on the country ofliving, maybe even the country where this website is hosted, etc.Concluding I would say, be careful with VSTis, Hardware should be OK, and don't sell the samples you downloaded from this forum (obviously you CAN sell the ones you created yourself!).",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=6144&sid=2a9941f1a89949985e1893d1b32514d8#p6144

The synth section in something like the NS2 is very limited, and its almost impossible to nail a sound unless it's a really simple sound, created on a synth with an architecture that the NS2 models (even then, the simplest of synth sounds - something like Van Halen's 'Jump' is never going to be anywhere near as good as on a real OBX). I can't speak for the NL2 or the NLA but even these will have their limitations, even in the most skilled sound designer's hands...However, you may like this idea: I was thinking about something kindof related to this topic, the other day:A great deal of effort was spent in the past by Johannes and others to create a list of patches by title, user with links etc., but AFAIK this was quite laborious for those involved to update and maintain.What would be great is to have a web app, possibly developed as a custom module for this board (PHPBB3 i think).- First of all, it would provide a central place to upload patches and samples, rather than buried in a thread.- The task of classifying the patch/sample would fall to the uploader, so minimal admin maintenance- To add a sample, contributors would be required to provide:- a description- a short MP3 demo of the sound.- guidance on any settings (e.g. attack, decay etc. for samples), or performance tips (e.g. modulations, specific key assignments for samples or suggested range(- some basic metadata attributes to describe the patch: e.g. Cover version (with artist/song name), lead, pad, etc.- Finally, when users download a sample, they get to provide a star rating for quality. Then there could be a leaderboard of contributors, e.g. most prolific, highest ratings etc.All this sounds like a lot of work, but there are quite a few software/web developers among us... I don't have time to take it on alone, but i'd be happy to contribute. I have a feeling there is probably already a custom module that does some of this, that could be used as a starting point - e.g. a module that lets users upload and rate photos may have some similarities.@Johannes -  What do you think?

The point is, it takes time and effort and from our experience here you will have a hard time just getting say current Top40 repertoire zip file containing all files so you can just come to a gig and play like a Pro.I have seen many requests here, but for a decent library or program list to be simply used there are just too many songs out there plus man people like to experiment, just upload sounds they like rather than meticulous replications of some original tunes or particular versions of a song.I agree the nature of a forum is not optimal for such a task, so we added the collections which are not automatized but updated at an irregular basis as it takes time.Neolithic I take your point that creating a full customized database with nice frontend to provide all samples and programs in one place with the possibility to upload, create previews etc. could be nice. Only thing is whether it is worth it given the number of patches and samples, compared to the potential number e.g., of sounds of pop/rock songs to look for. Using STRG+F on the collection pages for now should achieve the same trick. Maybe one day...In fact, I think this would be also useful for the Nord Websites as browsing the sample library can be a bit tedious at times...Marlowes, and about the Nord Lead, it will be there before Spring begins, promised!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=53151&sid=2a9941f1a89949985e1893d1b32514d8#p53151

We have a completely different and well thought out dynamic in each setup, however in both cases - the drummer has to work the hardest. Playing the cajon has helped me understand that a lot.

Obviously you shouldnotconnect the instrument at home anymore, until you arrive to Europe.3.change the fuse (different voltages need different fuses). There are various posts in the forum about this (search for ""fuse"").

Alternatively (more expensive), get a cable like that one posted by Merlimau (called ""2 pin Euro plug to C7"").5.*most important*: stick a note on the panel, so you do not forget to switch the voltage and fuse back when you returned home.ORGet a 230 to 110V transformer (not sure what is the US voltage is 110? 115?). Unfortunately those are heavy and buky, but you save all the hassle above.ORAs you are already thinking, the easiest is to rent the instrument when you are there, less to carry around, less risk of breaking anything.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=42981&sid=2a9941f1a89949985e1893d1b32514d8#p42981

I did it because I enjoyed it and it never felt like a chore. Visiting the forum multiple times per day was something automatic, taking a few minutes each time to see if any new users needed to be approved, spam removed, etc.This is one was pretty funny.Lately however I find I don't visit the forum very often anymore and I also don't really miss it. My synths hardly get touched these days and some I'm actually selling to make room (space as well as budget) for other things. For example, today I finished building a crate to send my blue Waldorf Q (32 voices, since it has the DSP expansion) to the new owner in Croatia next week.So what's keeping me busy then... What's been eating up a lot of time lately is the robot soccer team I've been participating in for about a month now. We need to qualify before the 14th of February for theWorld Cup in Brasillater this year. There is still lots and lot of work to do.I've very much enjoyed my time on this forum and having used several forums, I can say this is one of the friendliest.A big thanks to Johannes for keeping this forum running and keeping advertisements off of it with his own money (please consider a donation if you think he's doing a good job). Of course, without all the fun and friendly people on the forum this place wouldn't be worth visiting.If you want to reach me, you can send me a PM via the forum.

Admittedly, my continuing good opinion about this has been influenced greatly by formally ignoring one person whose over-the-top idiocy makes me wonder why he ever comes here in the first place and also doubt whether he is actually a musician or merely a tokolosi who takes delight in causing problems.Seemingly we all come together here in the pursuit of issues relating to creating music.  For me personally, this pursuit has at its core large elements of peace and love and worldwide fraternity, a la Mahavishnu's ""Planetary Citizen.""  From time to time I have written vile, nasty, rude and ignorant responses to posts I've seen here (because I too am capable of being an idiot), but no one here has ever read them because I typed them out only to vent them from my system and then discarded them rather than post.Take your hate and box it up and throw it away in some dark neglected space where it will bother no one.

But it seems for forums on Mobile Devices tapatalk is the best working software so far, but it costs 3$, but at least you can use for many other forums.Alternatives:On Android, there is a free tapatalk client called Convo:http://www.androidpit.com/en/android/ma ... alk-client. (have not tested it!)For 1800$ we could buy a tapatalk license and create our own App which then could be free for users, but thats about 600 licenses for tapatalk...not before 2020 I fear!Potentially, a Mobile-optimized Version of the Website with autodetect might work, but this project is only in its beginning so far and will take some time (link). EDIT: Its not gonna work, pretty rudimentary code. You will have to use the standard website instead. Sorry.On the Iphone/IPad, you might try TouchBB (from the Appstore or go tohttp://www.norduserforum.com/touchbb.php), there is a free version (only for full screen access on the iPad you have to pay). (have not tested it!)EDIT:I just deactivated TouchBB since it is a bit problematic when it comes to security and as it it also not (anymore) for free, Tapatalk seems much more functional so decided to only go for this method. Anyway, there are already a lot of people using TAPATALK so should not cause too much trouble anyhow.Bottom line, today, tapatalk is the industry standard in Mobile Forum Access, but there are some ways around at some cost in terms of functionality etc.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=4925&sid=2a9941f1a89949985e1893d1b32514d8#p4925

And since I've seen several gifted photoshoppers around already, there might be someone interested in participating.So here are the rules for the contest and those interested in participating:1) The graphic should be of the format 728x90 Pixel (max. width could be 810px)2) Needs to work with the unicolor (or gradient) menu bar3) Color scheme could be adapted (header background, menu bar, but also for the rest of the site)... suggestions welcome!4) The word ""Nord User Forum"" OR ""norduserforum.com"" needs to appear on the graphic.5) It needs to blend with a either unicolour or gradient (like it is now, 90x1px, see attached file) background in any colour in order to allow for the rounded corners and flexible width of the header bar6) It needs to be in gif/jpeg/png format. Animated GIF is possible but in this case a static version needs also be available (for the content pages).Basically, some crazy Synth Stuff would be fun, obviously related to the Nord brand but must not be completely Nordish.I will see what I can throw in as a goodie for the winner. If there are several suggestions I will start a poll to vote for the winner.Let me know what you think and I hope for some good propositions!!CheersJohannesCurrent Background Gradient:",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=7271&sid=2a9941f1a89949985e1893d1b32514d8#p7271

This is my first visit to the forums in a year or so. Around this time last year the band I play with, The Back Issues (check us out on youtube), were flying pretty high. We had just played our most prestige gig to date at the holy grail of British venues, The Cavern in Liverpool and requests were coming in for us to play at other venues around Britain and Ireland.Then tragedy struck. I was making my way to work on my Vespa along the route I have been taking every day for years. It was a glorious early summer morning and I had let the usual rush hour traffic die down before setting out. Mine was the only vehicle for as far as I could see both in front and behind me. Coming to an offslip, I slowed down and indicated to merge with the traffic to my right to continue my journey. Another driverin the lane I was merging with flashed me in and before pulling out, I did my lifesaver over my right shoulder just in time to see a car inches from me and in no hurry to slow down. I just had time to think ""Oo-er, I'm a goner here"", then hearing and feeling the impact and the last thing I remember was seeing the floor of my scooter in front of my face and thinking ""what is that doing there"" before coming round in the middle of the road.To cut a very long story short, I had a fractured spine along with other spinal and muscularskeletal injuries.

I agree it is not ""best practice"" to send them via mail. I changed it some time ago since there were many requests to send passwords via mail as many users seem to have forgotten there passwords, and having it for a record in the mail seemed the easiest way to avoid countless change requests etc. But I agree in general it would be better without, just a way of convenience (and used on around one third of the forums I visit) vs. security, and given this is ""only"" a forum and does not contain (most likely) sensitive issues so the convenience factor seemed to dominate. But it might be good to go back to the standard.Nevertheless, the passwords ARE stored encrypted in the database, the only time they are processed unencrypted is precisely when sengind the confirmation mail.Also, we always keep all elements of this forum's software up to the most recent updates and security standards (also best practice, but nevertheless not the case on many other forums), and security is top priority. As for the password, we can easily remove sending out passwords.Best regards,Johannes",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=29341&sid=bac198e2e076508e83dee10da14b07fe#p29341

The thing is that I actually do not hear a lot of jazz and blues.  Here's the story on the why: I wanted to join a band/club to force me to practice since I was starting to feel my skills were being lost due to the lack of practice. At first I was going to enter Rock club, but it was too late for me and my city right now is highly dangerous. So I saw that jazz club was sort of early, ending at 1600 and I decided to enter. I also entered because a friend of mine who is a guitarist insisted I joined because they had no keyboard player, so I would have no ""competition""In the club we have a teacher that guides us but basically what we play and do is up to us. in this semester we are going to adapt several mexican golden era movie themes to jazz, starting with this one.[youtube][/youtube]and also we are selecting a few blues songs and we are going to interpret them. With that repertoire we are going to assist a jazz festival on november and play at several events of the university.So first, what jazz/blues artists/albums/pieces do you recommend that are fine examples of how a keyboardist should play?Also any advice in particular about developing in such an environment, things (not) to do or any tips?I saw the other topic about bebop scales and I am going to check out some of the things recommended in there, just FIY.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=6924&sid=bac198e2e076508e83dee10da14b07fe#p6924

Those are superb to start doing solos since you can get a lot of ideas from his various licks, and they also make good exercises.I know what you say about not listening to piano players, specially because it can be too intimidating!! listening to guys like Bill Evans or Dave Brubeck to Chick Corea and Hiromi is totally intimidating, it makes me believe I can't even play the piano. Then there are times where with my fellow bandmates we play very simple songs, like All Blues and people praise us for our playing.

I find that helped me a lot, since I had peer pressure to actually play something.One way is to find a music school that teaches Jazz (since it looks like you want to play that style), they will probably have some kind of ensemble so that you get used to play in a band context. Doing so is very different than playing alone.Also, sometimes its not very important what notes you play as long as they belong to the scale (specially in jazz). It is more important to have a correct rythm so try practicing with drum loops and metronomes.Just my two cents,Gustavo",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=26041&sid=bac198e2e076508e83dee10da14b07fe#p26041

Had exactly the same question, where's the (other) board?? This way you could hit the North (ehh,Nord) Wave...Nope, sorry to disapoint. Just a bed, my camera, my keyboard, and a computer that serves them both (and about to die, after 5 years of backpack treatment...).Btw, I'd like to advertise a great product, 100% artisanal : do you see the little black and silverish box atop the NS2 (on the organ section) ? It is an sd-card midifile player/recorder ! It's so simple, it takes less than one second to switch on and start recording... So I keep the technical hassle to an absolute minimum when improvising music (which is my trade). It has one power input, two midi connectors, one sd-slot and that's it. Direct rec, play, stop, file select and transpose buttons, and no menu ! It can even record for days at a time so I don't even have to think to press rec when I sit myself at the keyboard... Well, in theory, that is. I suppose that would work well in a conventional studio, but in the van, the fluctuating power makes it freeze eventually... But not being able to record for more than a couple of hours in a row is the only complaint I have. And of course it is so simple that it records everything that comes through the midi input without discerning: all channels, absolutely all midi message and sysEx... So I didn't even need to look at my NS2 implementation chart or worry about anything of the sort. Then the midi file goes into the computer. A music software (Reaper) allows me to edit the midi, play it back to the NS2 and record the audio from the NS2 on a parallel track. Next step: still in the same project, mastering of that track, then reapers renders directly in FLAC format, and I can upload a perfect improvisation to Bandcamp within minutes... It's a great and quick workflow that, thanks to this little box, lets me turn on the computer and start worrying about Windows only after i'm done playing ! (Yes I run Windows on a Mac, because, er, I'm the rebel type. 8D)Apparently the circuitry and firmware are a German open source project and the box and interface are an English piano freak's project. So they found each other on the internet, and then I found them. Here's the English website for the final product:http://www.sdmidicontroller.com/. That man is very friendly, btw. Or Google for ""SD MIDI CONTROLLER"" and find the project at different stages of manufacture.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=24961&sid=bac198e2e076508e83dee10da14b07fe#p24961

On the other hand  there are also quality differences.The Acoustic and Electric Pianos have more punch and velocity in 5.30. The Frequency response is generally smoother for most pianos in 5.30.In 4.00 for example there is a problem note that occurs in Studio Grand close XL on A3 at certain velocities.These kind of notes are almost non-existent in 5.30.Mixing and matching pianos  allowed me (an EX user)  to use more at once.!Older piano versions will not work on the Nord Stage 2!Anybody else have something to add?,https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=22259&sid=bac198e2e076508e83dee10da14b07fe#p22259

I did that to emulate a 'swell' effect with a cheap Casio keyboard's organ sound (well, with Clavia keyboards, you have a dedicated swell pedal jack, so we'd better find a more useful example).The Boss FV-500 (or FV-500L - i don't remember if there's any difference) is a stereo volume pedal that works well with guitars AND keyboards, and can also act as a control pedal (expression, swell or whatever) -- except the control pedal mode is not compatible with Clavia products (or, at least, not with my NS2).

R820120726reuters wrote:(Reuters) - Comforting news for anyone over the age of 35, scientists have worked out that modern pop music really is louder and does all sound the same.Researchers in Spain used a huge archive known as the Million Song Dataset, which breaks down audio and lyrical content into data that can be crunched, to study pop songs from 1955 to 2010.A team led by artificial intelligence specialist Joan Serra at the Spanish National Research Council ran music from the last 50 years through some complex algorithms and found that pop songs have become intrinsically louder and more bland in terms of the chords, melodies and types of sound used.""We found evidence of a progressive homogenization of the musical discourse,"" Serra told Reuters. ""In particular, we obtained numerical indicators that the diversity of transitions between note combinations - roughly speaking chords plus melodies - has consistently diminished in the last 50 years.""They also found the so-called timbre palette has become poorer. The same note played at the same volume on, say, a piano and a guitar is said to have a different timbre, so the researchers found modern pop has a more limited variety of sounds.Intrinsic loudness is the volume baked into a song when it is recorded, which can make it sound louder than others even at the same volume setting on an amplifier.The music industry has long been accused of ramping up the volume at which songs are recorded in a 'loudness war' but Serra says this is the first time it has been properly measured using a large database.The study, which appears in the journal Scientific Reports, offers a handy recipe for musicians in a creative drought.Old tunes re-recorded with increased loudness, simpler chord progressions and different instruments could sound new and fashionable. The Rolling Stones in their 50th anniversary year should take note.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=20123&sid=bac198e2e076508e83dee10da14b07fe#p20123

And while I don't have an iPad, it can definitively be fun and is a pity it does not work there.Finally, after long discussions and trying out different solutions, I think to have found the best candidate. But while we ran tests on several machines, OS, and browser combinations, you can never anticipate all potential problems, so I would need your help in order to see if the new player will work for all (or at least 99%) users.Therefore, I implemented the new player for now only on the start/portal site in the left column for the latest two uploaded patches.Only if it turns out to work for everyone I would want to implement it throughout the forum, notable the samples and programs sections, the collections, and also the ""My music"" forum. And finally also retrospectively change all the existing posts.So I would be very interested if you could just quickly reply to this thread indicating (a) if the new player works on your PC/Mobile/Tablet/whatever, if it works ""correctly"" (i.e., as the previous player, just playing back the sample), or if the mp3 file is being opened in your audio player or just downloaded. Secondly, I would also be interested in hearing your general opinion on design or whatever you think.I also created a small poll cyou can fill out, also if you have nothing particular to say.

I'd pretty much decided I was going to forget about keyboards entirely and learn guitar or bass. I caught somebody (probably John Peel or Tommy Vance) play Deep Purple's ""Speed King"" on one of Radio 1's rock shows they used to have back then. I picked up a ""best of"" LP the next day, and was transfixed that a Hammond organ wasn't that cheesy cinema music instrument after all, but a genuinely powerful keyboard that could take on a guitarist and beat them at their own game. From then on, all keyboards went on the ""Hammond"" patch and got shoved through a distorted amp, and of course it was only a matter of time before I picked up the real deal, culminating in an A-100, and the Nord Electro for practical gigging purposes.I've grown up and become a bit more refined since then, but if I hadn't discovered Jon Lord's playing, I would have lost interest in keyboards completely and either just be a guitarist or bassist, or not in bands at all.

He has been an inspiration to me for over 40 years. His playing on Deep Purple in Rock so inspired me as a teenager in the 1970's. Child in Time is still my favourite song of all times. That Organ sound on the iconic song and Album is easily replicated on the Nord Stage 2. I wanted to share the fact that Jon Lord had influenced me for years and I saw him many times when he played with Deep Purple in concerts around Australia. The highlight for me was when he played with the Hoochie Koochie Men at Sydney's iconic ""The Basement"". He was at his trusty Hammond B3 (it might have been C3 on the night) and was 2 metres away!!! That performance is available on CD/DVD. What a night!So this post is for Jon and all the people around the world who loved his music, his playing and his quiet and humble nature. From that to his history making coupling of the mighty B3 with a Marshall amp, truly makes him unique.It is fitting that the Stage 2 has several organ patches called Jon Lord and they remain my favourite B3 sounds on the Stage 2.You will be missed Jon, but not forgotten.Anyone else have memories of Jon?CheersKevin",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=19586&sid=bac198e2e076508e83dee10da14b07fe#p19586

So for the moment I switched back, but will keep looking into that. For one thing, phpbb3 plus the addons that are used on this site plus the flash players and portal just require all their server resources plus load time. korgforums just to mention, is extremely fast, but is using plain phpbb2. On average, load time is 4.9sec (SE: 1.8Sec), so 95% of visitors should experience a loading time of the FRONT page of <9 seconds.

Not to mention the clav and wurly that didn't change at all.Now i have the Stage 2, and little has changed in that departement.Instead, nord has been sampling every instrument imaginable - even if less nessecary for us as keyboard players.If i want a good convincing bass, there's no way a 7mb library can touch stuff like trillian or scarbee mm bass.A couple of months ago nord released brass section samples. Now i see they re-released an improved version! Of a brass section!They even did that before re-releasing rhodes samples.They designed 4 new instruments.It seems like they will do anything imaginablebutreleasing better rhodes, wurly and clav...And these are some of the most frequently used sounds.

I would not assume they are not also working on other, more complicated projects while they are releasing these.

I don't see it happening however as it potentially lowers the control they have over their platform and may give other companies more insight into their technology (and the limitations). I fear it will stay a fully closed platform, as with most manufacturers. At least Kurzweil allows you to tinker with the internals (making it rather complex, but when you understand it very, very powerful).It would really be nice if independant companies (like Bolder Sounds) were able to create sound libraries in NPNO format with more than one layer. Licensing this content is a whole different can of worms though. How would you prevent person A from using sounds bought by person B, especially without limiting them overly. Clavia currently does not have this issue - if you have a Clavia board with the right functionality, you can use the sounds they make available.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=15359&sid=bac198e2e076508e83dee10da14b07fe#p15359

It's great that Nord has a terrific track record of bringing new sounds you can load into your keyboard, better than anyone else. But if it doesn't have the sound you need on the day you buy it, you should buy something else.Nord will probably come out with new EPs, but there is no guarantee. Moreover, they could come out with new EPs, and you might not like them! So if this is such an issue for you that you must have EPs other than what is in the Nord today, you really ought to find a board that has EP sounds in it already that will make you happy, rather than just being unhappy with what you have. Life is short!Personally, I always like to gig with two boards, for a variety of reasons (weighted and unweighted actions, backup in case of failure, wider range of sounds instantly available without having to call up different presets or worry about running out of keys at a split). So instead of replacing the Nord, you might want to find a board that complements the Nord by having strengths where you find the Nord to be weak. You can use MIDI so that you can trigger either boards' sounds from either boards' actions. For EPs, I would probably look at a Kurzweil (one of the many PC3 variations, or an SP4) or a Korg (Kronos at the higher end, SV-1 at the lower). Alternately, you could look into triggering a rack module (or laptop, etc.) from the Nord to get the sounds you want, if you want to keep the Nord and don't want a second keyboard.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=15361&sid=bac198e2e076508e83dee10da14b07fe#p15361

However, in the background there are other players, big and small and at some point, unless Nord keep the pedal to the metal, other boards will look like serious competitors.I don't want to gig numerous boards. Dragging a Rhodes Suitcase and Clavinet around was more than enough. I want one board.As far as I could see, the Korg SV-1 and Nord Stage were the only competitors for what I had in mind and the Nord organ swung it.

I have utmost respect and thanks to those at Nord. In my opinion, the Nord Organ is a serious contender for a hammond, The Wurly is as good as my old EP200a and less noisy, the Rhodes ARE brilliant. I did prefer my suitcase sound, but Nord could easily do one of those. I prefer the synth to my old Minimoog D, I think it's easier to use and less prone to drifting. The clav sound is a bit ""thin"" but really, it has none of the drawbacks of the D6....feedback, noise, etc. the effects are great and all in all, it is the best value I've ever got out of an instrument.However, to make it an all time winner, I'd like a ""bigger"" Rhodes Suitcase and a fatter Clavinet.

The cost alone would be a lot more than we probably realize.  First, you would have to find an excellent specimen of a 30-something year old instrument.  You can't just go down to the pawn shop and buy one anymore.  Second, you would then need to book some studio time.  Without a good environment and equipment, a good recording is impossible.  Next, you would need to process the recordings and create the samples to please everyone.  All of this would be a task that is not to be taken lightly.

For those who say ""too many synth samples,"" keep in mind that, to sample a synth, you take a line out, capture one strike at every so-many keys (those boards weren't velocity sensitive to begin with, so that's not an issue), and you're much of the way there. Sampling pianos is far more complex. EPs are somewhere in the middle. You have to find a good piece to sample, you may need to do some work on it to get it in tip-top shape, and then work out a way to reliably trigger each note mechanically at a variety of consistent velocity levels, all before you even get to the complicated work of looping and blending the samples and mating them to the velocity response of the MIDI keyboard. Though unlike acoustic pianos, at least you don't need a high end studio with an ideal acoustic environment to sample an EP.I think it's also worth noting that, for all our complaints about the EPs (and I'm among those who prefer to use other boards for my EPs), many people do like them, and Nord themselves apparently thought they were quite good when they made them! People don't agree about these things. Heck, I didn't like any Nord grand prior to the Bosendorfer. I hope they will come out with some new EPs. But I don't take them to task for not having done it. I guess I""m more of a glass-half-full guy. If and when there are better EPs, I'll enjoy them.

I was thinking more in the lines of an ambient, loud suitcase. I paid £500 for mine and there was nothing special about it. It was pretty horrible inside, although every note sounded lovely. I agree that ""getting"" a clavinet is a lot more difficult. However, I'm sure ""matey"" that Nord uses has the ""jig"" for pressing the notes right! We have the rough organs on the S2 and the E3/4.

If they had given better keyboard, improved piano and midi-features, I would probably updated my NP to NP2.Considering what the changes were, I think it's safe to say that the NP2 wasn't designed to appeal to current NP owners, but rather to appeal to probably a much bigger potential market, those customers who might have bought the NP except they needed it to have some additional sounds and splits/layers, like so many other DPs out there. I think it will likely sell better than the NP did as a result, so I think it was a good change to offer. (The only part of the NP2 that I could see really appealing to most current NP owners is the Long Release feature... and I think it's great that Nord was able to offer that to existing NP owners as a free software upgrade.)As for the keybed, personally, I think the Nord Piano has the best feeling keybed you can get on anything under 50 lbs. I know, that's subjective. It would be nice if it had a third sensor and was more responsive to a  thumbnail gliss, though. The problem is, Nord is limited by what Fatar has available, and whatever tweaks they can make within those designs. Since Nord doesn't actually manufacture keybeds, it's the part of the design they have the least control over.Other than more memory (which everyone always wants, but is expensive), what improved piano features would you have liked, that are not simply a function of creating new piano samples (which don't require a new model, since they can be loaded into existing models)?I am curious myself about the MIDI functionality of the NP2. There is no manual to download on their web site. Obviously, it is not designed as a MIDI controller. No pitch bend, no mod wheel, no aftertouch, no assignable knobs, and they're probably right that the target market for the NP2 wouldn't want to pay for those things. But, at no hardware cost, it would be good if the two ""sections"" of the NP2 could be set so that they  transmit their key ranges on different MIDI channels. That alone would be enough to provide a lot of flexibility. You'd be able to layer an external sound over ""just"" your piano area of the keyboard or ""just"" the sample playback area of the keyboard, or, by creating a preset where the sound for one of these two sections were ""blank"" in terms of internal sounds, you'd be able to create a patch where a portion of the keyboard consisted only of an external sound. If it does not already do this, that would be a nice enhancement they might be able to provide in an OS update.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=15475&sid=bac198e2e076508e83dee10da14b07fe#p15475

I think they have done well in that department, giving original NP owners more of what they bought their piano for, at no extra charge (i.e. new piano samples, improved long release feature). Original NP owners did not buy their boards to split and layer, obviously, but I think Nord greatly increases the model's marketability to new customers by now offering those features... while not angering old customers, which would be the downside of offering paradigm-changing models too often. For every customer like you who would react by saying ""wow, I can't wait to spend $$$ to upgrade to the new improved model,"" I bet there would be many more saying ""$#!&, I just spent all that money on a new 'upgradable' board, and this frikkin' thing comes out.""JacksonP wrote:Phone companies know it very well: How many of us really need to have a new phone every year or every second year?

In the U.S. most new phones are very cheap or free, which makes constant upgrade easy. The real thing the sellers are after is to lock you into a two year contract, they're not making money on the phones in the first place.

Also, its free.Although Chordata cannot go slowly for you and it may be sometimes bothersome to stop every second, you can make the piece slower. But just making it slower will affect pitch, so what I did was open up the .mp3 on Reaper (http://www.reaper.fm) insert a very long silence at the end, then right click and on item propertioes you can select the rate of playback, it is on 1.00000 by default.

We finished the next 4 sets with an out of tune upright piano, drums, a harmonica, an acoustic guitar, and unamplified vocals.We spent the first 15 minutes running around lighting extra bar candles trying to figure out what to do with no electricity before remembering that music transcends technology, and electricity.It was the best gig ever, we sang '50s and '60s tunes like the old street corner a capella groups. It worked out really well because most of us in the band had played together for many years in a 1950s revival act.We doubled the size of the crowd from the night before, simply because of bored residents hearing the drums and singing for miles through the open windows of the electricity-free void, and wandering down the street to see what all of the excitement was about.My point behind this grandpa story is that if you have confidence in your musical ability, and the musicality of your group, you will prevail through any crisis.Cheers, Hanon",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=6269&sid=c00721882f567e09ed5bb77000f02206#p6269

Smaller venues might not have DI boxes but in this case you needed one (or two if stereo again, or a stereo DI) DI-Boxes plus long XLR cables (sax, 10 meters) to connect to the mixing console (Some places even might lack the XLR cables).So depends on the type of venue your playing. In my experience, if you need a DI there will be one. And if it is a small or more or less accoustic gig or bar/café concert, you might not need one altogether if the mixer is close to the stage. But then be sure to have long enough Jack cables. I always carry one of these:http://www.thomann.de/gb/the_sssnake_1802_adapter.htmwhich in the worst case let's me use my two 5m (=Stereo) Jack cables as one (=Mono) 10m one in case you need to directly connect to the mixer besides the stage.Enjoy the show!!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=6301&sid=c00721882f567e09ed5bb77000f02206#p6301

Begin slow and just go faster until you're at the right speed. That could take a while, but it will work and you'll get a lot of respect from the other musicians. I did the organ and piano part in Ben L'oncle Soul's version of Seven Nation Army and I just listened to which notes were played together and just tried until I got it right.If it doesn't work in that way, never give away the biggest part. Just play the clav yourself and let the guitar player play the brassEDIT: You can also try doing the brass with you left hand and the clav with your right hand.
