They sound fantastic together, of course.When not using the real Leslie Studio 12 I use the Nord Leslie sim just like everybody else.  And I control fast-slow with the sustain pedal.The Studio 12W does not have a 6-pin Leslie input, only 1/4 line level.  So the speed control (fast/slow/stop) of a Leslie Studio 12 is via a (1/4 inch TRS) Leslie pedal.  It is not controlled by the Nord.In case anyone else has the luxury of using the C2D with a real Leslie, the real Leslie doesn’t do well with the simulated Leslie input.  Turning OFF the Leslie sim in the Nord solves this perfectly.  Just turn it off entirely and the real Leslie/C2D combination is as good as my B3 and 122.However, I would like to simultaneously use and record the MIDI output of the C2D to control a B3 plugin, at the same time that I play the real Leslie, including the fast-slow data.  So is there a way to get the Leslie Studio 12 to respond to the MIDI fast-slow data?  That would be the best.   OR how can I record the fast-slow actions of the Leslie pedal for use in the software B3 ?Tough questionJ",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=184182&sid=1fd5b1b5a4f935b545eaba18ad695d8f#p184182

The synth engine is far better than Nord's as well.

On the Nord C1, you are able to use the ""Unison"" effect at the same time as the chorus/vibrato effect, which means there are sounds you can get on the C1, that you can't on the C2.Also, I prefer the location of the on/off buttons on the effects on the C1, at the bottom of the panel near the keys; this lets you turn them on/off while playing, if you have a free finger.Plus, it might just be in my head, but I swear that the V & F models on the C1 are different than the C2.Otherwise, the B3 definitely sounds much better on the C2, the MIDI implementation is better, and most other things are better.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=51470&sid=1fd5b1b5a4f935b545eaba18ad695d8f#p51470

The difference is like night and day.The C2 has support for bass pedals, Bx3 inexplicably didn't.C2 has 11-pin output, Bx3 had no leslie connection.With the C2, you can have a leslie attached to the 11-pin output, and have leslie simulator coming from the left-right 1/4"" outputs.

I miss the drawbars of the Bx3.OH YEAH - and you can update the software of the C2, which is now upgraded to the same sounds as the newer model.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=36102&sid=1fd5b1b5a4f935b545eaba18ad695d8f#p36102

Also, the Leslie sim on the Oberheim is laughable, so I used a Tube Rotosphere pedal for that, which was a lot better, though quite noisy (subjectively, noisier than the real thing). The actual B3 emulation on the Oberheim is not bad, though the modelling of the physical quirks of the B3 are much less advanced, and hence the overall sound is less convincing. That said, it was quite good in a band situation; just rather a mess with all the separate bits and wall warts.Going back to the original clones, I have what is probably the 0th-generation original - a Yamaha combo organ with variable tab stops of most of the footages you get on a Hammond. Not really the same sound for hundreds of reasons, but flexible enough to get a good result through a Leslie. In fact, the Leslie is the key to it all, because once you put your organ of whatever sort through a screaming Leslie the effect is there even if it is noticeably 'not Hammond'. But I'd much rather gig with the Nord than take out the Yamaha, cool though it is, purely on weight grounds. 100 pounds+ just for the manuals, before Leslie and any other PA is a lot for a supposedly portable organ. And, true to form for a 60s or 70s organ, the legs have gone missing, too.The final clincher for me was the Baroque organ in the Nord; my background is mainly classical and I will be using the organ for continuo work, outdoor concerts and so on where a proper organ sound is needed. All in all, the only practical way for me to go, and having such a good B3 emulation as well is just magnificent.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=36133&sid=1fd5b1b5a4f935b545eaba18ad695d8f#p36133

I've been one of the lucky ones to have owned a C2D now, for 11 yrs.  Played, recorded, gigged for most of that time, and am still convinced this clone is the best in town!   I'm predominantly a jazzer now, and love to use the STOP leslie sim choice as do many of the old school players.  So the good and not so good news is simply this;  As is the case with a vintage leslie, the horns and bass rotor can stop in any position relative to the front (or mic'd side) of the leslie.  That means of course, the sound may be softer, brighter, or somewhere in between.  And, the C2D leslie sim, with its amazing ability to simulate that, does the same (actually has 3 distinct tones that it cycles thru each time STOP is selected).  Here's the not so good news for me;  I really prefer only one of those 3 choices, and would like to set it as a default.  Pretty sure however, is that there's no way to do that.  So unless I happen to land on the tone I prefer, I have to switch out and back in to STOP 1 or 2 times until I cycle to my choice.  Hence, my question:  Does anyone know if and/or how to set a default tone for the stop position?   I've sure looked and looked thru the manual, and cannot find anything about that.Thanks for any comments.BTW,  I build wooden ""B-Free"" stands for clone wheel organs.

There are adapters to go from one to the other.Your hypothetical MIDI foot pedal will hopefully be configurable in what commands it sends over the wire, and over which MIDI channel.The Nord C2 (and many other keyboards) publish a list of MIDI commands that they will respond to over a shared MIDI channel, including swell pedal among all the other potential commands.The documentation can often be wrong, though.  It can get more complex, as you have to insert a computer into the loop to monitor the conversation that's happening over the wire.  Or, some kind forum member might share what the undocumented command might be.Hope this helps?",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=176212&sid=1fd5b1b5a4f935b545eaba18ad695d8f#p176212

Have any of you ever tried to find a stand that enables you to place an electric piano above a C2d (or SK2, or Mojo, or anything else where the whole of the top is controls) in a position where it is as comfortable to reach for as plonking one down on top of an A100, but all organ controls remain accessible? I have. The old Quik Lok monolith is about the only one that I've got any joy from, and that is discontinued IIRC.That flat top on the Legend Live is GOLDEN.

It's not only for aesthetics, even if a flat top undeniably looks better than a spaceship-like panel full of screens, lights, knobs and button.

Not only it looks awful (imho), but it denies the advantage of having the flat top in the first place.As for an hypothetic future Nord organ, I doubt it will have the flat top because Nords are always aimed at live players, so size and weight are big concerns...it was not a coincidence that the C2D was the smallest and lightest of the two-manual clonewheels.

I mostly love it, but one of the keys is rather unresponsive and has to be pressed very hard to sound. In addition to this, in general I'm not impressed with the keybed; it's quite stiff compared to a real B3 or my Roland VR700, and the keys are very loud and clacky. Not that big a deal, but if I'm practicing something like a French toccata with a lot of repeating 16th notes (I'm mainly a classical organist, just dabbling in the B3 side of things, hence my interest in the C2 with it's pipe organ setting) it can get absolutely exhausting pretty quickly.So my question is, what is the possibility of having the keybeds of both manuals replaced entirely with something with better action?

I realize that this a very subjective question but I was just wondering what the concensus is amongst those who are using the Vent with their C1/C2/C2D's.

I did A/B comparison at a gig and definitely found myself gravitating more to the Neo Ventilator sound.  To my ears and taste, the advantages of the NV were:-Ability to easily tweak acceleration, rotor speed, balance (top vs. bottom), overdrive, and mic distance in real time to suit the room/situation-Rotary simulation is deeper/more pronounced (to a degree that is adjustable with the mic distance control)-Even more than the rotary simulation, the extra ""crunch"" provided by the NV overdrive gives a great sound even when the horns are in slow (chorale) mode-I have the remote pedal for the NV, which provides the brake (horns completely stopped) option.  Although this can sound really great on a real Hammond/Leslie setup, it seems to lose a lot of presence compared to chorale on the NV.-To use the C1 with the NV, the rotary option of the Nord should not be activated, or you get a warble on NV fast speed.-The NV has a mono output, which sounds great.  I've used the stereo outputs as well, but really have to be paying attention to appreciate the difference-Even though I like the enhancement provided by the NV, sometimes when in a quick on/off the stage situation, I go back to the C1 internal Leslie sim for simplicity, and it still sounds really good.-Other conifgurations that I use include Hammond M3/Leslie 145, Nord C1/145, Hammond XK2/NV, etc.  They all sound really good.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=24017&sid=1fd5b1b5a4f935b545eaba18ad695d8f#p24017

I'm a semi-pro player from West London. I'm no pianist by any stretch and generally restrict myself to B3 and Wurlitzer sounds at gigs. Currently gigging a C2D thru' a Vent Mk 1; own an A100, a Lowrey Festival (think Garth Hudson) and a Wurly 200A.My dilemma is this: my first foray into Nord wares was an Electro 4D. Loved every thing about it sonically - I already had the Ventilator, so continued to use it as they are hard to give up - but coming from an A100, the jump to just one set of real time drawbars was just too much. I eventually sold it to a pal and bought a C2D and another stage piano for my Wurly sounds. I'm just getting to the age where I now want all my sounds from one board, but it must be dual manual and have at least two sets of drawbars. But I'm not seeing anything at all from Nord on what the future is for the C2D or rather its succession. And with the rise of the Mojo/Legend, it can be argued that the C2D IS ripe for a rethink. That chorus vibrato is a little tired sounding now, and better internal Leslies can be found on newer clones. So, I look to the competition:The Mojo ""XT"" recent update is infuriating: a hardware update, a proper power supply...yadda-yadda-yadda...but the EPs aren't Mojo 61 generation and STILL you can only play the Wurlitzer with a combo organ on the other manual! Ideal if you want to make Steely Dan's ""Do It Again"" last a whole gig, but...nah. I'm a staunch Wurly man and a top manual organ and bottom manual Rhodes is NOT want I want! Not even with tremolo, before you ask, no. And some of the video evidence of what a lovely racket is made when a Mojo is used in upper organ/lower Rhodes EP made is just all the more of a tease, knowing that there IS a usable Wurly in that beast, that you can't quite get to.The Hammond SKx has at last improved the drawbar sets to manuals ratio, but...well, it's a Hammond SK. The EPs have been improved in their voicing to keybed, I'm informed...but the same old samples, and the Wurly isn't all that, to put it kindly.Is there ANY insight on what we can expect to replace the C2D and when? I'm guessing that with Crumar (to an extent) and Key B (almost exact) now offering much more traditional solutions to the clonewheel console for just a little more bulk, and for less money, it might be that we will not see another fully-featured dual manual console organ from Nord. But a two-manual, two-drawbar set Electro-based solution to take on the SKx with all guns blazing would be music to my ears indeed.Anybody know anything?",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=105748&sid=1fd5b1b5a4f935b545eaba18ad695d8f#p105748

Nord, to an extent, have lost a chunk of the traditional market now that the Legend Live has offered the magical combination of the smallish size ""one lump"" clone in the accepted as sensible console-sans-preset octave format AND with the full complement of controls. It has given the Mojo (previously the winner on traditional feel, user experience and many say sound) a kick up the ass by offering a near perfect 'dashboard' AND a flat top for another keyboard. I always thought it was idiotic of Crumar to use the top of the Mojo for controls when there was space elsewhere, but the full complement of four sets of real time bars and weight/size saving on the C2D mitigated it for me. The Legend Live has dished it out to both Crumar and Nord there. A new C3D/Electro Duo/whatever would at least get round the flat top problem by eliminating the need for an electric piano. The Mojo (duo not 61) even with the GT update does not, quite - you still don't get to pick exactly which extra voices you want on the lower manual when running organ up top. If you are a Rhodes player, no problem, but being a reed EP man I'm still not catered for there.Meanwhile, Hammond Suzuki (remember them?) sneak out the SKx and finally give the bare minimum acceptable level of two sets of drawbars! But these are rigidly anchored to top or bottom manuals; why can't they be like the Korg CX3/BX3 where you had set A and set B and could opt for either set from either manual? The new Nord should offer this: the flexibility to switch between two sets of real drawbars on the same manual when using another sound on the other one, and also to be able to opt for either set from either manual when playing two manual organ. I'd love to be able to comp chords using a Wurlitzer piano sound on the lower manual of the C2D successor, but know that up the top I can set up (say) a watery whistle to add colour, and a fuller registration for soloing or to build a crescendo.Oh, and it's an SKx so the EPs sound like s***. That would of course not be the case on a Nord C-series/Electro hybrid....And please, Clavia - don't be like Crumar - does anybody need umpteen definable presets? What's wrong with drawbar set A, drawbar set B, one user preset and full organ?",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=107339&sid=1fd5b1b5a4f935b545eaba18ad695d8f#p107339

My main objective was to come up with something the same dimensions as a C2/C2D. I also wanted two manuals for playing organ, so any additional keyboards would need to go Midi In to my NE5D to go through the leslie sim, rendering any buttons on a second keyboard mostly redundant...although, a full second keyboard might have the added benefit of pitch bend as you suggest.

I don't know why; we've had this before as the (digital) Korg BX3/CX3 did this beautifully. You had set 1 and set 2 and they weren't upper or lower prescribed, you could select either one on either manual. An 'Electro Duo' would really benefit from this: to have the facility to run non-organ sounds on one manual but still be able to toggle betweenbothsets of drawbars on the other, as you can on a B3 manual, would have my credit card out my pocket in 30 secs flat.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=113071&sid=1fd5b1b5a4f935b545eaba18ad695d8f#p113071

As an English Church Organist, I fell in love with the C2D and have to say, I like it for the organ stops, but and yes there's a but.... (is there a mr. butts here? a seemore butts?) I feel that two things could really be updated here. The Nord Stage 3 which I love to bits, could do with the organ samples from the C2D's pipe organ setups rather than the emulation modes which sound nothing like a genuine pipe organ. That said, if using certain samples, the emulation mode does give a character to the samples. The C2D could really do with more focus to the pipe organ needs where divisional and general pistons could be added, also the ability to add samples for other pipe organs and orchestral voices.I will openly say this as a confession.IfNord came out with a C3 and gave users the ability to have a 3rd manual as an optional extra which could be attached / detached, then a more expanded pipe organ section, I'd buy it, even if I had to sell my body and soul under a lamp post.... nah.... not that desperate but as an organist / session musician I need something that offers the requirements I have as a classical organist. The C2D has this. I suppose that the Viscount Cantorum Duo would do, but based on what it offers, it's not enough and has speakers built in which I don't need, so added weight. there's other organs but are single manual, unless there was serious money, then my dream organ would be the Johannus Live 3 which Nord could take a cue from.I venture into the realms of B3 / farfisa playing, what does disturb me a touch is the lack of a further octave lower in harmonics / frequencies to really bite on the bass, but of course, that's modifying the core principle of the farfisa / vox specification.Confession over.....

How many people would buy it at €4K or more, when the Mojo costs less than half and the SKX 1000-1500 euros less?And when you can just buy an Electro or Stage with a cheap lower manual MIDI controller, and have the same sounds with much more flexibility?Maybe the solution could really be to just produce a lower manual for the electros, like Crumar and Hammond are doing.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=132679&sid=1fd5b1b5a4f935b545eaba18ad695d8f#p132679

The latter seems inconceivable, but the former also doesn't sound plausible to me.A third option would be to keep working on the organ emulation but only as in included in the Electros and Stages. Again, I don't see why they would spend their resources on this and then deciding not to produce a separate organ instrument of any kind.I think we have little clue about how a company like Clavia deals with this kind of marketing aspects, and any speculations shouldn't be taken too seriously...

Nord developed its Hammond emulation well before the C organ line, for use in the original Electro. Then, given the success of the Electro 1 and 2, they decided it was worth to put that emulation into a dedicated two-manual chassis.If for the moment it's no longer worth it to produce a cumbersome and expensive double-manual organ (which btw is only our guess, we have no idea what Clavia is thinking/doing about that), I see no problem at all in Nord continuing to refine their organ emulation for the Electro and Stage line.After all, it's what many major manufacturers (Yamaha, Roland, Korg, Kurzweil) are doing: they all have well-developed Hammond emulations but don't produce any double-manual clonewheel. The 2-manual portable organ sector is a VERY niche portion of the market, and I doubt it's very profitable nowadays with all the options available.Personally, I want to see Clavia keep pushing its Hammond emulation forward, because presently there are better-sounding clones out there. Especially for the Stage and Electro lines, they need the best possible emulation to keep competing with the various YC61, Vox Continentals etc.I loved the idea of the C2D when it came out because it was the best sounding, most portable 2-manual-4-drawbar-sets clone available. But it was really too expensive even back then, and now I'd simply buy something else. I had a C2, I currently own a SK2 and I think its emulation is noticeably better than Nords and much more customizable and versatile. It suits my needs and I'm not looking to upgrade, but if I was on the market now, I'd buy a Legend for the most faithful combination of tone and physical layout.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=132701&sid=1fd5b1b5a4f935b545eaba18ad695d8f#p132701

The Mojo and the HX3 are, on the other hand, definitely superior (whenever I have to record, I opt for the VB3 II), but it's not like Nord's as behind as, say, Korg's CX-3 and Yamaha's YC simulations: Clavia surely need to improve the Leslie (hopefully re-introducing a 145 simulation) and the C/V, but it's doable.I refuse to believe Nord would stop investing on one of the main reasons they became one of the most acclaimed keyboard manufacturers. I mean, many of us need the beautiful EPs and the sample library but still play the B3 as their main instrument!

Forever!Once a Nord organ is preamped with the real deal AO28 original,it behaves better.The rca preamp input is not an ornament. Expression on FC7 still not the same as real deal,AO28 gets it a lot closer to behaving proper though.The steel Boss pedals have a shallower travel for seated performing than an FC7!This Stage3 Compact likes it's 390 pound stand!On the C2D,still use Ventilator and other second party FX.A real 122/142 Leslie will bail any Nord out! Building a real AO28 preamp 'lunchbox' to get what I need. Lounsberry TallFat/Wide not an AO28!Will use the 1/4"" line level out of C2D into AO28,that way the Leslie will see more than the 11V RMS from the C2D.About 16V RMS out can make a 122 or 147 treble horn cranky! Careful!11V RMS is the 'rentals' market output for anyone playing a 'governed' rental.Not even close to old school levels of a modified touring Hammond.Don't mind the extra gear once on a 'pedalboard',need damper,speed/expression on every gig anyway.It's all preset to work on the floor too.No more time than individual wires and pedals for set-ups.No voltage drops or padding.Original Neo Vent input right off red and ground.(single leg hi-z) of the AO28 preamp.Padding is for rental outfits worried about the drivers.Those Meyer UPM-1P speakers down below? In stereo don't really miss the Leslie much,if at all.Extra bass supplied by original AO39 17 watt 2X12"" A100 amplifier! Still reproduces lowest octave good enough to mix in! Tubes baby! Real 17 watts.A real Leslie is 35-40 watts if that.The Meyer UPM-1P pick up where the 'dulled intentionally' trebles vanish on the original A100 built in 'tone cab'.,add the key click Hammond was so desperate to hide.No cheekblock toys needed.When I need more or different overdrive,the Boog Model D and Neutron have external inputs.They run circles around stompboxes.Real analog ring modulations etc.B3/A100 etc allowing me to coax more realistic tones from the clones!Nord needs to add the R1 bypass mod to it's organ menu.The volume drop on perc normal is so 'stock' and lame.Nord should insert a guitar amp and overdrive sim, 'pre' Leslie sim.I run the speaker outs of guitar amps right into a tube Leslie with a Nord as the instrument...many others do this too.Come on Nord,you can get off your duff and do this!Where did the mid range go, evident on StageEX,Electro2 organs? Valid question Nord has never answered,along with many more.Resting on laurels is what rock stars with one hit tend to do.Wish I was that lucky......Nord now stumbling badly through sophomoric attempts to get back the minuscule market share of clones,my opinion of the situation.They could shock the 5000 or so players that use  clones to make a living with something new,likely glad to be 'out of the game' is most probable.If they get back in,we know it will be well built?

APs/EPs on one of them, plus the Electro's sweet FX section - that's all I ask.A sample synth, dedicated organ/piano outputs or more flexible assignments (drawbar to manual, section to manual, effects to section etc.) would be a huge plus, but not a deal-breaker for me.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=149756&sid=1fd5b1b5a4f935b545eaba18ad695d8f#p149756

Nord could not keep making the C2D even in small numbers.I'm sure they ""could"", if they wanted. But they probably decided it wasn't profitable anymore, even in small numbers.The 2-manual clonewheel market has changed a lot since the C2D came out. At the time, there were essentially only 3 models: the C2D, SK2, and the Crumar Mojo.Two were from well-established companies, one was from an upstart Italian boutique manufacturer, and they were well differentiated in price and features.The C2D was much more expensive than the others, but justified it by being the only one with 4 full sets of drawbars and being the smallest and most portable: perfect for the gigging hammond player.Nowadays? Nord's Hammond emulation has largely stayed the same, while Hammond and Crumar have vastly improved. Many additional small and big players have entered the picture (without even mentioning software instruments): Viscount, MAG organs (HX3), Korg, Roland, Yamaha all produce instruments in direct competition with the Electro and Stage lines with options for single-manuals, dual-manuals and 1+1 expandable-manuals. With 1, 2 or 4 sets of drawbars. With or without additional non-organ sounds.Most notably, almost all of these offerings are cheaper (in most cases, MUCH cheaper) than the 3K that the Nord C2D used to cost.The Viscount Legend offers a great organ emulation in a completely faithful Hammond layout (2 manuals, 4 sets of drawbars, reverse key presets, rocker tabs etc), and still costs less than the C2D. And the smaller Legend Live and Legend Solo are even cheaper.The Yamaha CP and YC series are clearly inspired by the Electro-Stage concept, as are the Roland VR-09 and Korg Grandstage-Continental.Crumar continues to tinker with its Mojo designs.Hammond just released the SKX-Pro which is very much a direct dual-manual Nord Stage competitor: great Hammond emulation and 3 other sections of highly editable non-organ sounds.In this market, the C2D would be a very expensive option with few advantages over the cheaper competition. No surprise Clavia decided to retire it.We'll see if they find a way to reduce the price (unlikely), if they go the ""dual-manual Stage"" route like Hammond did, or if they simply decide to stay out of that arena for the time being, focusing on the more lucrative stage piano segment.Given the hard times we're in, I wouldn't be surprised if they chose the last option, trying to weather the storm in wait of better times.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=150093&sid=1fd5b1b5a4f935b545eaba18ad695d8f#p150093

Even the new SKX-Pro still uses the same, old, outdated VASE engine: Nord's emulation might be old, but Hammond's way older, and was surpassed by the C2D's back in 2012 anyway. Whilst Nord and Viscount have been improving their clones significantly, Hammond's been simply making minor updates to the New B3's digital simulation. Actually, the same would hold true for the BX-3, which only sounds (really) good thanks to IK's superb (the best ever, in my opinion) Leslie simulation and effect pedals.If you own both the B3-X and VB3 II apps, hook up the B3-X to an external Leslie software (like the Mojo's, which's bundled as a separate app): it's weak, especially on the high registers (and the keyclick's quite fakeish too); on the other hand, route the VB3 II through IK's Leslie cab simulation and you'll get an almost-indistinguishable-from-the-original clonewheel. Buying a Hammond keyboard nowadays means overpaying for a brand (the XK-5 has a great keyboard thanks to the simulated contacts, but that's it). Nord's true and only competitors are Viscount, Crumar and HX-3. I too hope Nord have been working on their B3: as Valpurgis pointed out, ten years of zero updates is way too much. But recently it seems as though Nord stopped actively working on many of their strong points (it's been almost three years since the release of the White Grand piano).",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=150948&sid=1fd5b1b5a4f935b545eaba18ad695d8f#p150948

The 3300 is not that heavy, you can haul it alone if you are a big guy, but to get in in and out a European wagon without damaging the interior or losing the lightweight bumper is an art on its own. If it fits at all. The original leslies are even bigger en heavier. In other words, almost unusable for gigs unless you have something like a van. The most fathers and mothers will not buy a commercial car or a van. So how do we do this?I'd like to see a list of spotted alternatives, next of the Leslies themself and some specs, (dis)advantages etc. Keywords will be sound, usability (like connections), price and transport. If one of these aspects scores low, the mobile leslie becomes less interesting..Imagine ... you are alone, it is raining, it is cold and windy, your small car is not next to your house, say, on the parking lot in front of it, with bad pavement. You like to go to the weekly rehearsal or play a gig somewhere. At 01.00 AM you have to bring the complete set back in your house without waking up the neighbours. Let's say you live on the second floor, but with an elevator to keep things reasonable. What kind of leslie solution do you prefer?*)For US and Canadian readers; a car of the size Ford Mondeo or Volvo V70 is considered 'large' in the Netherlands. This because gasprice is high and car ownership tax is rated by weight (3400 lbs dieselcar is about 190 USD a month). A van becomes less attractive for non-commercial use. With that being mobile with a large instrument.I kick off with a Dutch company:VanderPlas Baileo - POR500 - rotor speaker for organs and keyboardswebsite (in english) :http://www.vanderplasbaileo.comLink to the speaker:http://www.vanderplasbaileo.com/index.p ... &Itemid=91e-mail :info@vanderplasbaileo.comPOR500por500.jpg (75.02 KiB) Viewed 31427 timesThis company offers two active (so amp included) systems; a small one for use o with vibraphone (PRV-60), and the POR500 for use with organ. They also build a midi bass pedal board.This is a rotory speaker system in two parts. Therefore it looks transportable. The small wheels do not look as if they are ment to be bumped over the pavement to your car or to a cafe or stage and back again at least 2 times a week. But the good news is that It's weight isabout  25 + 12 kg in two units so a separate transporter will not be an issue. The top part seems portable enough. If it rains we can cover it all.It uses a 2x500W Alto Power amp  (class d technology) with two channels and a crossover (a crossover divides the signal in a high-frequency and low-frequency part before it goes into the amp). The original leslie does this at 800Hz so I assume it is like that,not sure yet. You can also order it with a different amp or without the amp.The low freqs are covered by a 15 inch woofer (400W / 1500W max). Now we heard about the low-freq issues with the Leslie 3300 (drops at 70Hz). To solve that an active subwoofer can be connected to do that part. The 3300 does have a separate subwoofer output. I don’t know if the POR500 needs something like that and if it does have a separate sub-out..The speed-up and slow-down rate is not adjustable, although is can be reprogrammed by the company. How the POR500 default response to the Nord Halfmoon switch is using the 1/4"", is  not clear yet, but I understood from the company that the they can make it work for you.Update> because the 11 pins connector is available, it can be controlled by the C2 using the 11pins-cable.It is available in red (hey!) and black.Rotor/Lower part:Freq range : 22Hz - 3500 HzPower : 400W / 1200W maxSize : 65 x 50 x 86 cm, including 8 cm wheelsWeight : about 25 kgHorn/Upper part:Size : 65 x 50 x 30 cmWeight : about 12 kgDid not heard it yet. The freqreange suggest something low, although not clear is how the response is from let's say 30 hz - 200 hz? Does it drop somewhere and how much? In other words, how does the bass kick?I understood from an e-mail that the speeds and rise- en falltimes are programmed. This timing is fixed, but can be (re)programmed by the company. If you want it to control yourself, they can add a touch panel.1/4"" jack for audio, stereo 1/4"" stereo jack for speedcontrol.There is a demo-speaker with a 9-pins. 11-pins is also possible.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=37979&sid=07c9c64a044fcc92be42d23d79487847#p37979

IN the case of vacuum tube designs it was always a trade off. Produce maximum power from a vacuum tube and you loose sound quality. Keep the sound quality high, and you can’t produce much power. The original 122 and 147 designs took the middle way – a reasonable amount of power with a reasonable amount of fidelity.Why is this important? Because of this design decision and the way these tone cabinets were used by performers, the unique tones of the hard driven and over driven Hammond™ were born.With our preamps, the tonal warmth of vintage organ was resurrected for the clonewheel keyboard, now with the AMA the subtle hint of distortion of a hard driven Leslie™ and the over the top grudge of a fully over driven one are once again available.The AMA has done for Solid State rotary cabinets what our preamp did for the digital clonewheel keyboard. It authenticated the sound; making new sound like old though the careful use of vintage vacuum tube technology!""",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=38007&sid=07c9c64a044fcc92be42d23d79487847#p38007

Without the numbers, just by ear according to Alfredson the 3300 just does not give satisfaction in bassplaying. If you play the Jimmy Smith kind of bass (left hand + pedal) that can become something  relevant. It could be that he is using the 3300 for larger room, like you mentioned. Or that the 3300 is designed for keyboardplayers that don't play bass.the BTW : That is the reason links are added that directs you to the websites as close as possible to the company or first seller. Availability changes during timeI'm trying to contact the company for the 'Rotary'-system (http://www.parieorgan.it/speaker_en.htm) to get more info (Parie-Organ also seems to be a reseller of this system) but I don't have reply yet.  Unfortunately, because they look road-proof and portable, maybe need more powerfull approach in amp and speaker (and filters of course).",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=38299&sid=07c9c64a044fcc92be42d23d79487847#p38299

I'm curious ...Hi Neighbour,Nothing special, not a two-seater. As a bench I use just some rigid foldable old bomb-proof thing with four legs, high enough -organ benches are higher than normal chairs because of the pedals-, found in a remarkable stuffed second hand shop.Together the C2-set in the very nice Nord-gigbags fills up my German car quite good : C2, Pedalboard, bench, Nord C2-stand and two active monitors/speakers with 15"", 43cmx43cmx65cm, 35 kg (17x17x25 inch, 77 lbs) each, a flightcase with with (spare)cables, volume pedal and tiny things etc and the spare tire and some other carrepairstuff to keep the passenger seat free for a nice female saxophoneplayer (hey!). Just being pragmatic, there is something like a transportlimit in an avarage European stationwagon because of the size and count of the objects, which makes the transport (read: choice) of a leslie a bit puzzling.If you see the Portable Hammond B3 (the B3P) set: Besides it is not possible to move the 125cm(52inch) wide 60kg (132lbs) organconsole by 1 person, I don't think that the complete set fits in my car together with a Leslie. By the way, were did they put the pedalboard on this picture?Capture.JPG (51.8 KiB) Viewed 20305 timesYou mean the Solton and Elka-tone speakers? I don't know about smaller models yet. Please feel free to add them here, it could be very interesting indeed.Once I had an Elkatone which was still a washingmachine of 73kg/154lbs (they also build stuff solid in those days), and it was loud! (no tubes) Unfortunately I could not get it in my car on my own without damaging it (the car I mean, it lost its' rear bumpercover while hauling the Elka in. It became an expensive Leslie after all).DIY's is not really the thing I want to go for, although it is tempting, it also feels like a alternative scenario that should not be necessary. A Nord deserves a nice Leslie.Besides that, DIY is a single case solution and second hand means limited available. I'd like to see a handy and good mechanical Leslie available for all Nord organ players.Maybe Nord can design one there own?",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=38304&sid=07c9c64a044fcc92be42d23d79487847#p38304

In the end it really depends on what route you want to go, how much difference to the classic 122 sound you can tolerate and how much you are a DIY person or not.You can see two of my heavily modified leslie clones here:http://www.musiker-board.de/reparaturen ... -bass.htmlhttp://www.musiker-board.de/reparaturen ... slies.htmlIt's all in German, but perhaps you'll get the idea anyway. For me those two units were the chance to get a real rotary speaker without the expense and the bulk of a ""real"" leslie cabinet. Installing a new crossover modelled after the 122 is a piece of cake for anybody who knows to hold a soldering iron the right way. It's really that easy, and the cost for the parts is usually below €50. Even with the stock amplifier you should get a decent sound at a fraction of the cost of a Electro-Music leslie. If you want more sound you can start thinking about adding a tube head, but you certainly don't have to.On some of the pictures you may notice that I went a little crazy in adjusting those leslie cabinets to my personal needs. Well, I did it because it was fun and because I could achieve big improvements in usability for a limited investment. But you don't have to do all of that to get a good-sounding leslie clone. The crossover is the most important modification, you can easily skip the rest.Also, as a working musician it never hurts to have a good tech you trust. Leslies or their clones may look complicated, but active speakers, digital pianos, mixing boards etc. - they can fail, too, and it's always good to have someone to fix your stuff up for a decent price. Plus, how many guitar players do play tube amps but wouldn't be able to service them?From my personal experience I should also add that, once set up properly, those SpaceSound leslie clones (SpaceSound was the Italian manufacturer of the actual rotary parts) have given me years of trouble-free service without larger maintenance.

And you can always improve the Leslie by putting a Vent on it, and possibly improve on whatever else by using it to trigger B-3X, VB3, or you other software of choice, so you can improve the areas where you see it as weak. Whereas on the other boards you mention, you can't susbseuently do anything to reduce their travel weight or add extra sets of drawbars you may want.Also, the Nord brand is probably more available than the others at brick and mortar stores, so that's appealing for the ability to try it before you buy, and often to have a local place who will facilitate the servicing for you if you ever need it.

The C1 has just one mode, which is similar if not identical to that first video's slow mode, but it's hard to tell exactly. With a more extensive video, I'd hope to be able to tell whether it's the same, or whether the C2's slow mode may be a bit slower than the C1. (It definitely does not look faster, and it probably would not make sense for them to have made it faster if they were specifically adding a fast mode anyway.)The Electro 3 also had the fast/slow mode, and I actually felt neither was really satisfactory. I'm finding the C1's single speed to actually be more usable, but I don't know if it's actually better (i.e. if it has a faster version of the E3's slow mode), or if I've just better adjusted to it.If the C2 slow mode is in fact the same as the C1's only mode, I'd be happy with it; if the C2's slow mode is slower than the C1's only mode, I'd prefer the operation of the C1. Since 90% of my usage is as a controller, while I assume I might prefer the C2's sound for the other 10% of the time, I would want to stick with the C1 if it felt more satisfactory to me when operating as a controller (which is why this came up in the first place, in the other thread).",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=139033&sid=07c9c64a044fcc92be42d23d79487847#p139033

If you want knobiness, Yamaha also has the YC61/73/88 which also has piano/EP/FM in it, but the FM section is not programmable like the Reface DX, instead the board has 28 popular FM sounds in it (and also uses the FM to generate its transitosr organ emulations).

Since I own a Hammond C3 (which I no longer carry around due to the weight), I really miss a 2 manual organ.A possible solution...This is much lighter to carry around than a dual-manual would be, and the keys are almost as close to each other as they are on a dual manual. That's a Vox Continental on bottom, with most of its controls covered, since for this kind of use, you don't need access to those controls during live performance. There are rubber stoppers under the front of the Nord, so that the Nord's weight doesn't rest directly on the controls of the Vox so as not to risk damaging them. I did leave just the very lowest part of the Vox's top panel accessible, just for patch recall. I've set up those buttons to be able to recall the Vox sounds I prefer to the sounds in the Nord (not its organ sounds!), and one button is set up with a silent sound, so all I have to do is hit that button and (since it's a Stage) the Dual KB button on the Nord, and I'm in 2-manual-Nord mode. Getting/adapting the right stand is an important part of it, too. But it does produce a very easily transportable 2-manual Nord, with the additional advantages that the Vox has a particularly nice feeling action, and a bunch of really nice sounds of its own. For example, I like its EPs and brass better than Nord's. And if you were pairing it with an Electro rather than a Stage, it would give you additional functions you don't have in your Nord, like monophonic lead line synth sounds with portamento and a pitch bender. It's a very lightweight board, available as either 61 or 73.

Whatever Clavia will come up with, at this point they can't pretend it didn't happen. Yet, I am not sure that implementing any form of multicontact emulation, or redesigning the interface so that such tweakability is easy accessible in the main panel, is something they can come up with in just a few months from now.Speaking of tweakability, for example the XK-5 lets you program how much leakage from which weel into which one... each by each. Or how much key click (attack click AND release click) you want for each contact of each key. OK it may well be exaggerated for most people, but the huge advantage of such big tweaking scope is that no two of them will be the same after some customisation, and this, at the moment, isn't true for the organs found in Nords, which, however good, all sound exactly the same for a given model.Now things like wheel-by-wheel customisation would require heavy menu diving and this surely isn't appealing for Nord enthusiasts. Some may as well say that such a fine-grained customisation is not even the point of a good clone. And I'd say fair enough if it weren't for the fact that any hypothetical successor of the C2D is going to cost at least 2,500, and considering how the market has been elvoving in the last years it's going to be increasingly difficult to find someone willing to pay that much for an organ with much less tweaking possibilities than others and without a multicontact emulation. What would it have to have to justify the absence of the above? A killer core sound? Except that the core sound is already pretty much there and not too dissimilar from the other top end clones, in my opinion. Not easy to come up with a forward leap in the core sound itself so huge that it would, alone, sell the thing.I do hope they are trying to catch up with the rest of the market in all the other aspects, but if they are, it's going to take a bit of time. If they are not, and they'll come up with a only marginally improved C3(?), then I don't know how much attention they can expect from customers...

At least this is what it seems from the early info that's been circulating. And while one could rightly argue that physical contacts are more realistic, the huge advantage of velocity based multicontact simulation is that it relies on an existing (and cheap and light) hardware.

In the former case, we might expect Nord to come up with something along those lines without too much issues.

That is, a compromise between the two. The other possibility would be like the XK-5, that is sensors activating a bunch of contacts each, but with only 2 real trigger points I'd imagine the outcome to be not so realistic...

I guess the system lets you adjust both how random and how asynchronous they are going to be, but still it's going to be the same for any given setting and totally non-dependent on how I physically play, which could quickly become overwhelming.I am assuming Frank Montis in that video is using the other mode. By the way where did you read it's velocity based? From the way the key reacts in the video, it doesn't seem the case, as the key is being hit quickly but not fully, which is the point of the multicontact emulation after all. It might be a similar implementation as in the XK-5, in that certain harmonics come in after the first contact has been close, and the remaining ones after the second contact has been close.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=139843&sid=07c9c64a044fcc92be42d23d79487847#p139843

Whatever Clavia will come up with, at this point they can't pretend it didn't happen. Yet, I am not sure that implementing any form of multicontact emulation, or redesigning the interface so that such tweakability is easy accessible in the main panel, is something they can come up with in just a few months from now.Like so many, I too would like to see some basic EPs in the C2d successor, but let's not forget that the Hammond SK-series are Electro rivals not dedicated organs, so in essence replacing the C2d with a dual manual Electro would be my preference, but I'd want at least two sets of drawbars and I hope that the appearance of the SKx would trigger that anyway. But the C2d as it is - like the Legend series and the new 'Classic' Mojo, neither of which have piano sounds either - remains very much an organ not an all-in-one like SK/Electro products, so no AP/EPs.Clavia could clean up here as the EPs in the Suzuki SK series are pee-your-pants-laughing quality, and Crumar still haven't upgraded the dual manual Mojo to the same architecture as the infinitely superior Mojo-61. That said, given the poor quality SK pianos and EPs, at the moment the most credible way to get a dual manual with some extra voicesisstill the old Mojo, but that has some weird stuff happening (eg, if you want a Wurly on one manual, you have to have a Farfisa organ on the other!).I can't say I ever get excited about multi-contact keypads or partial emulations of it. In all the years I played tone wheel Hammonds (I still own an A100) all I ever found a use for that function for was to demonstrate what happens if you press a key down slowly. Like the way that key click ends up being more tweak-able on many clones than far more significant things like the chorus/vibrato, I think the keybed thing could easily become over-obsessed about. Frankly, there is more variance in action, sound and almost any measurable 'thing' from one tone wheel console to another than there is between one clone wheel and the next, or between any clonewheel and an original. I'd vote for a standard Fatar keybed and keep the cost down.The XK5 is great but it is very bulky, very expensive and I'm not a fan of that Hammond 'modular' format - for the effort of lugging about two separate manuals and a stand, I'd stick with my current rig of a C2d and a dedicated stage piano.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=140151&sid=07c9c64a044fcc92be42d23d79487847#p140151

It's true that it's a niche market and there are many competitors right now, but also note that the dual-manual competition is also moving in the ""organ-only"" direction: the Legend is a pure organ, as the HK-5. The Mojo had extra sounds in the original, 61 and XT models, and dropped them in the new dual-manual versions. The new SK-Pro has extra sounds and features, but is single-manual only (for now, at least).It may be that exactly because the dual-manual sector is small, highly focused and targeted at dedicated organ players, those customers simply don't want other sounds on their organ, and will use single-manual do-it-all keyboards for all other non-organ duties. Otherwise it's difficult to explain the success of the Mojo, Legend, and even the C-line from Nord.It makes sense after all: if I only need some generic hammond sound to play some chords together with pianos, synths etc, it's quite awkward to dedicate a whole second manual to that (and to do that, having then to play piano on a 5-octave unweighted action). Better to simply split my Stage or Electro and dedicate just an octave or two to organ. Conversely, if I'm a pure organ player and make full use of the two manuals (and possibly the pedalboard) for serious hammond work, I will simply have no more keys -or hands!- to dedicate to other sounds.I can relate to this experience because when I was getting into hammond I bought a Nord C2, then quickly exchanged it for an SK2 because I needed the extra sounds in my band. Result: I quickly realized that for typical cover band work, my Stage 2 will always be better and more practical than the SK2. Its hammond and leslie sound is MUCH better than the NS2's...but not so much to make me give up all the other advantages of the Stage.So the SK2 stays at home on its fixed stand with pedalboard, and I use it only for practicing my pitiful organ skills, hoping that one day I'll be good enough to start an organ only band!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=140415&sid=07c9c64a044fcc92be42d23d79487847#p140415

I remember having that option on my old Electro 3 and not liking it... in Slow mode, it took too long to ""push"" or ""pull"" a drawbar setting all the way in or out, but fast mode was SO fast that anything OTHER than all the way in/out was nearly impossible, even just a quick tap would move it a lot. On the non-adjustable C1, it operates fast enough to get the bar fully in or out sufficiently fast, but you can also use quick taps to move it just a little at a time. This additional parameter in the C2 and Electro 3/4 seems to have been subsequently removed from the Electro 5 and 6, maybe they came to the same conclusion I did, that one always-usable setting is better than two frustrating settings.

I don't need the pipe organs of the C2, and while I wouldn't mind an improved internal organ/Leslie sound, I don't need it because my purpose was to use it as a controller in the first place. (Though even the built-in organ sound of the C1 isn't bad at all.)I actually wouldn't want a C2DbecauseI'm largely using it as a controller. That's where the LED drawbuttons become an advantage. They can always be in sync with my sound source, which you can't do with physical drawbars. I also have the Ocean Beach drawbar module, so I still have physical drawbars for the times that's really how I want to play... and for those instances, 1 set is sufficient for my purposes.

Yes, better low frequency reach, but -- more importantly -- conserving the monitor bandwidth as @ajstan mentioned.  An awful lot of power gets used to push out those lower frequencies, the driver and cone get awfully busy, and you'll get less clarity and authority in the upper frequencies as a result.I use this small, inexpensive sub (https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail ... -subwoofer) frequently with my CPS SSv3 (8"" main speaker).  When I do, not only do I get somewhat better bass response, but the CPS isn't struggling to handle the lower notes, and thus sounds noticeably better for what remains.  And louder, of course.This sub, like many, has a high-pass crossover built in -- audio goes there first, low notes get filtered by the sub, and the remainder is sent onwards.  You may need some special cables to go from/to XLR to whatever your home monitors use with this model, but other choices are available with the same general idea: modest sub, decent power, built-in crossover.If you want something more soul-grabbing and you really want to feel the roar of the organ, we're likely talking a small PA system or a killer home audio system.  My current go-to recommendation in the first category is a pair of QSC K8.2 units, but -- as always -- lots of other choices out there.  Much less need for a sub if you go this way.Watch your bookshelves carefully if you go for a small PA, as things do move around",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=135511&sid=07c9c64a044fcc92be42d23d79487847#p135511

I was a little too hasty with the splitter idea.  A small, inexpensive mixer (under $50) from Nady or others will do the job, and spending a bit more get lots more channels and features.  That is, as you point out, the right way to do it to match levels and minimise distortion.But listen to this! I got a SECOND bad PV115D!   Yup! Returned the first, got the second, and the HF driver didn't work. Returned that one, and now they tell me GC won't have any until mid-Novenber!  Methinks Peavey is having a few teething problems with their Chinese assemply location.  However, it is turning out to not be as big a deal as I feared. Everyplace we play there seems to be a sound guy, ready to mic or DI the organ.  Heck, I could probably just bring the Nord and run it through the PA.  So my obsession with having enough wattage and speaker to deal with any venue turns out to be uneccessary.And yes, the new weighted action digital pianos are incredible, playable, light, and inexpensive.  And probably (although I haven't tested this out yet) free from the sonic junk which made amplifying the earlier ones to high levels so problematic.However, my musical life is not problem free.  I made the dumb mistake of mentioning to my band (The Jilly Rizzo) that a friend had just given me a nice accordian, and they made me start using it.  Talk about humiliation!But on the other hand, I'm pleasantly surpised by all the use I'm making of the Pipe, Farf, and Vox models on my C-2.  Doubling down on the bass with bass guitar and pipe-organ pedals is really something.

But when the ""sim"" is engaged, however, the effect is in stereo, and the Leslie sim will sound much better through a stereo amp set-up. That is, either two amps, or one of them new-fangled angled-front amps which are stereo.I gave up on the Peavey powered speaker, after getting two duds in a row, and being back-ordered til November.   I purchased instead an Alto TS115A.  It's a ""Rubbermaid"" style (poly case) but the full length steel grill and well-proportioned case looks good, and, at 39 lbs it's the lightest of the 15"" 2-way powered speakers.  The manufacturer boasts ""800 watts (peak)"" but the cabinet is overpowered by the woofer long before that, IMO.When combined with the Motion Sound Pro3x the system sounds much, much better than with a Peavey KBA-100 'bottom'   Much smoother, much more musical capable of more volume. And there was an entire bottom octave of bass which showed up, too!  At $301 total (I had a coupon for $75) at Guitar Center, I think it's a great deal.  And I still have the option of running other keyboards through the speaker, or stopping the horn and using ""sim"".But remember those ""left"" and ""right"" outputs we were discussing? Well, I've only got one of them plugged.  What if all the sound escapes out the other one? Only thing to do is get another Pro3x (there's a used one at the local GC) and Alto and have stereo Leslie.

It will result in less max power, but the difference is barely audible if You optimize or not, so unless You plan on playing at full volume it's ok to mismatch in this direction.But if You choose powered speakers or a combo this is already optimized in the unit, so You can choose freely among all variants of these that suits Your needs.So go and see what variants that fit budget, fit Your portability needs, and fit your volume needs.Me personally, if I was looking for a flexible and simplistic amplification for Your needs, I would go with 2 powered speakers with more power than I really need, so that it would work from small to big venues. I'd solve volume from the C2 master volume (and keep the speakers volume control at a level where the C2 volume isn't close to zero or close to max so that small changes can be done mid-gig). Perhaps buy a couple of speaker stands, but most of the time I would place the speakers on the floor at 45 degree angle upwards and close to me so I'd hear best of all what I'm playing.We're running Mackie SRM450's in my band (where I play bass guitar) and I really like those, so I'd go with something like that...But there are many, many, MANY, different makes and models and they all work - they just cost different, have different power, different quality check and they all sound a little different...",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=121284&sid=07c9c64a044fcc92be42d23d79487847#p121284

Consumer equipment like soundbars for televisions accept consumer line level. Pro line level is a hotter signal and may damage amps with sensitivity for consumer line level. As long as you operate the keyboard gain not to clip the amp it should work fine. There will be a compression of dynamic range, which would matter for some sources, but not for an organ.The best way to amplify a Nord C2 to fill a space like a church sanctuary would be to use a pair of powered PAs and if you use pedals with a 16’ stop, a powered subwoofer. Electrovoice, JBL, Yamaha, QSC, Mackie, Peavey, and Cerwin-Vega all make products in this space. You will want stands for the PAs to get them off the floor.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=122727&sid=07c9c64a044fcc92be42d23d79487847#p122727

The 145 was born to operate fast / slow.  If it operates fast / slow AND OFF, it has been modified(likely with an EIS-147 relay)http://www.trekii.com/EIS122.htmlSince standard 145s are only fast / slow, that is the only function the 1147 kit is designed to provide.  In fact the 1147 kit neverlooks at the ""fast"" control line from the 11 pin source.  It only looks at the slow control line.  It the 11 pin's slow control lineis active, the kit tells the 145 to go slow.  If the slow line is not active, the kit tells the Leslie to go fast.Looking at the circuitry for the 1147 kit, it would appear that it should be possible to modify the kit to provide fast / slow /stop information to an EIS equipped 145.  However, this modification would require the addition of a relay, driver transistor andsome support circuitry.  Since I don't have an actual 1147 kit to look at, it is difficult to know if there is sufficient roominside the kit to add the necessary parts.  The fact that you are located on the other side of the planet only adds to thechallenge.

A tap on the switch toggles speeds between fast/slow and holding it for 1 second selects stop.  The pedal accepts the C2D for input and sends the balanced audio and DC relay control to the Leslie via an XLR cable.  In addition to the foot switch, it can be controlled using a 3-conductor hand switch, though I don't use one.At the Leslie end, there is an adapter box that connects to the Leslie via an Amphenol 6-pin locking EP connector (I dislike the Leslie 6-pin connectors).  The adapter provides switched AC power and the organ signal to the Leslie.One reason I made this was because I wanted to be able to use a standard microphone cable to connect the organ end to the Leslie end rather than an expensive Leslie cable.  I also wanted to run the pedal from 9 VDC so I modified the relay in the Leslie to switch with a control voltage that varies from 0 to 9 VDC.  If I were making it for general use, I would use a DC-DC converter to boost the 9V to 34 VDC, which would be enough to switch an EIS-122 equipped Leslie.

Why would you need that flat top when there are some usable EPs in the MOJO, you might ask? Because you can't run the Wurlitzer without having a Farfisa on the other manual, and this is frustrating as I generally play a whole gig with Wurly and B3 sounds. Plus, there are too many tales of reliability issues, and at least one pal found the senior management at Crumar/GSi to be deeply unpleasant and more than a little personally abusive when he had repeat issues. But the crux of it was the EP thing: a Wurly inside, but like a ship in a bottle! I'd have to take a stage piano around and that seemed daft - and this wasn't cured in the Mojo XT revision. This was basically the addition of a proper mains connection and an 11 pin socket. Not the hoped for new model based around the considerably superior Mojo 61 platform. Meh. Onto the next one, then.The Viscount Legend Live was looking favourite last year (I won't lie; after the theft the price was tempting this time around too) because the dashboard is a thing of beauty; truly a console in stripped back form. But there - another pal had reliability issues. I won't make the Italian car joke, but there's a common thread here! No EPs but at least a flat top to plop an Electro on, so a half bonus point there. But: there are no combo organs at all. It's pure B3, and does it very well, but the Tex Mex-er in me likes to have the 'punk accordion' option - ie accordion phrasing on a combo, just like the sainted Augier Meyers taught us, and Nick Lowe/Costello have made use of over the years. Yum.The SKX: I am sure I am not alone in saying that I take no pleasure in considering Suzuki the weakest link, being a pure Hammond guy who came to Nord reasonably late (an E4D was my first; the drawbars finally did it). The SKX looked promising: at least the bare minimum of two sets of drawbars now, and promised improved EP voices. But those EPs are still crap - it was tweaking of velocity responses and no improved voicing. AND they haven't put the new organ engine from the excellent but pricey XK5 in it. Meh. The only Hammond in my arsenal is a trusty, battered old A100, and it will stay that way for a while yet.So I came back to the C2d and re-evaluated. What is it that has people trading it in for Mojos and Legends? It seems to be the onboard Leslie is good. No biggie - I've been a Ventilator user since day one when I was still on a Korg CX3, and never gig without it. It was also said to me by a pal with both a Legend AND a Mojo that while the Leslies in both of these newer clones are quite nice and perfectly usable, and a big step up from the C2d offering, if you own a Ventilator you can't unhear the difference! The other biggie is the chorus vibrato on these newer clones, an aspect of the tonewheel sound which we all know took forever to get right. Maybe it is me - I'm not a jazzer, I'm an Al Kooper/Garth Hudson/Ian McLagan kind of guy, and for the sounds I pull the C2d chorus is fine - and I think I can claim to know my sh*t here: C3 chorus was the singlehanded reason why I stuck to lugging a split A100 for so many years, even for £50 pub/club gigs!When it comes down to it, none of the options with EPs on it were any good to me in that department, the Leslie was taken care of anyway and the one clone (Legend Live) that offered the same full console dashboard lacked combo organs. I'm sure any Nord organ sound engine update will nail the Leslie and tweak the chorus a bit, even if my fantasy of junking the pipe organ for a Wurlitzer EP from the sound library is the stuff of far-fetched dreams. But there - I replaced my stolen C2d with another C2d and I don't regret it at all. Long live the fully featured console that flies its own flag and plays second fiddle to no other clone.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=113069&sid=07c9c64a044fcc92be42d23d79487847#p113069

Not Hammond-like...not really organ-like.. but the Mojo is and the B3 experience on the Mojo allows you to play it as you would a B3 or a100. The Mojo, in my experience, is no where near as reliable if you use the shift and edit functions and has done things like generate no sound at all and taken me 30 minutes to get it back to normal. So, I just use it as a Hammond organ period and use my Nord Stage 2 EX for other sounds. So, a bit of a quandry. No way the Hammond Suzuki XK5 is worth the price. Plus I had a Hammond SK2 and the action, though more playable than the Nord C2, felt cheap like the keys were going to rip off.

However re: action...I like the positive nature of it, but too stiff as you say...I come from design/engineeringish background so thought I'd experiment a bit!..I,ve always lost money on clones and was reluctant to do it again.  I'm not recommending this change I made but it's worked for me. To weaken the springing without wearing the mechanical aspect of the action I did the following...Placed 2""X2"" wood batten measuring the length of manual on UM black notes and placed weight on it sufficient to lower all the notes (quite a lot of weight!) and left it for half hour. This was repeated for the UM white notes. Whole process repeated for lower manual. This did lighten the action without reducing positivity.  I repeated whole process resulting in the action being weighed down for 1 hour in total. For me it has worked without damaging anything. I really hope this is of interest but I stress that I'm NOT suggesting you do what I did, but its worked for me. Now I just have to practice and become a better player!I don't think Nord R&D read these mails otherwise they would sorted the C3 chorus & percussion which is central to my playing and awful as others have noted.

I know there is a lot of worship stuff out there and it seems  very musically. I want to get to the state where I am happy to go out with a blues band. I don't feel I have proper control yet.For Band orientated stuff I use Band in the Box. The C2 Goes into a Focusrite Liquid 56  through a rather grand old Surround Cinema Amp (Sony STR D8780) and then into Tannoy Reveals.For me the organ is sounding a bit shrill, perhaps a bit ""digital"". This could be set up issues of course, or lack of understanding on my part. If I had to I would buy some gear to improve the sound. I am seeking warm and syrapy.When playing the creature of desire, I find that I am usijng much less left hand because a full chord sounds muddy, not sure of what to do about that, often one note in the bass seems adequate. Is this right?As for drawbar settings, I wonder if there are any guidelines? I am familiar with Jimmy Smith setting, but that's really all. I went on Utube but just got confused eventually.There are presets of course. They seem to be quite different, but I have no way of categorising them. I downloaded the PDF list and they don't seem to be in any particular 'gigging' order. Am I right to think if I start saving presets then I lose the default ones? I think Yes.There is no way that I know to save a preset name? I think..?? Therefore it will be a matter of numbers.What do other people do? For example does it make sense to have ten 'lead sounds' and ten full sounds.Because I don't realy yet understand what drawbars work (even roughly speaking in certain settings, I feel like I am dabbling in the dark.I gues its all about ears in the end, but maybe some of oyu can give me advice about how you would/do set up the presets.

I play the Stage 73 so there may be a few minor differences but from my pov its very easy to over-employ the Nord, and that makes for muddy sounds; too many drawbars + conflicting chorus+vibrato+leslie settings. Two pieces of advice I think you'll find useful - especially coming from a piano backgound:1) start simple - remove all your effects and just build a clean B3 sound. Then add some percussion. Add your effects one at a time, then start to combine them. This will also help you to get to know how each effect changes the sound.2) Find your ""target sound"" - e.g. Green Onions and try and emulate that. There are examples of well-known organ settings on this forum you can download, and on Youtube Keith Appleton has a number of short clips on organ technique - one of which is focussed on manipulating the Hammond sound.The Nord is a superb instrument, particularly for live work - but it takes a month or two to get to know and love it - which you will.Rgds",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=57965&sid=5101abae1840e63b7adbe98e4d344fbf#p57965

But I would suggest not worrying about presets for the moment because once you 'freeze' a setting, sure you can replace it or do a new one, but the tendency is not to, especially if you're a player rather than a gearhead.I use the live settings so I have the drawbars in use all the time. I do find that although I probably start off with something like 88880000 on the top manual, I'll tweak it according to how I feel on the day, and where I""m playing and which amp/speaker(s) I'm using. To me it makes more sense to accept the Nord the way it is and use the drawbars to get the sound I want, rather than try to copy another instrument and have nowhere to go once I've nailed it.Another great reason for using the drawbars live is that it encourages you to take your hand(s) off the keyboard! Somebody once said on a forum somewhere that their ideal band keyboard player would have one arm, so they can't clutter up the texture the way we pianists tend to by thinking more is better. Open fourths/fifths are not wonderful on a piano, but on a Hammond, another matter altogether.Also, if you're going to play in a band you want to have your own signature sound to go with your signature licks. It's all very well imitating other players, but unless you're in a tribute band, it doesn't make sense to copy too closely.Oh, and if you want to do piano-like stuff on a Hammond, best to reduce all the brown drawbar settings, especially at the bottom end. Then, even if you do get carried away with super-rich jazz chords, they will at least sound a bit more like what you'd expect ...",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=58089&sid=5101abae1840e63b7adbe98e4d344fbf#p58089

You're trying to learn everything at once and you're just confusing yourself overall. it's going to take you as long to learn to play Hammond as it took you to learn piano ie years. Try taking one thing at a time; trying to grasp advanced techniques before you really understand the basics is like trying to learn Chopin before you've learned your scales and arpeggios.Start with learning some basic standard drawbar settings, simple chord voicings, and how to use leslie fast and slow settings. From there you could advance to learning melodic/solo right hand with simple single note bass lines or chordal left hand stuff - and just gradually build up your knowledge and skills.To answer your specific question about left hand work: generally, left hand work is much simpler that on piano. Left hand piano techniques such as broken chords and arpeggios don't translate too well, because a played note on organ doesn't fade like a piano note, so too many successive overlapping notes will tend to become muddy. The piano is basically a percussive instrument, the organ is basically a sustaining instrument, so you need an entirely different approach. The fact that there is no sustain pedal also dictates organ technique to a considerable extent: now your fingers will have to do all the sustaining. Typically, left hand work on an organ will be either sustained chords, or sustained or walking single bass notes.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=58106&sid=5101abae1840e63b7adbe98e4d344fbf#p58106

It's not set in stone but that's a start.Compared to the piano, if you use an 88800000 or 88880000 sort of setting, chords played lower down will become a lot more congested. You can get round that by moving your comping up an octave or by not using so much (or even no) 16' tone. Again, as I said above, you can use much more open chords on Hammond and the harmonics will make them sound great, where on the piano they sound a bit bare. Try to run with the sound of the instrument if you can; if you do everything I said at once, you'll pretty much turn your B3 emulation into a spinet model!I'd certainly go with the advice to keep it simple for the moment.

One easy trick is to move both hands up an octave to lighten the texture. Generally in harmony it works best to widen the gaps between notes as you go further down, so playing up an octave helps quite a bit. You can also try playing mainly thirds and sevenths in the left hand, roots in the pedals if you have them or redistribute those notes a bit to simulate that effect if you don’t.We’re all brought up thinking of 4-part chords, especially pianists - almost everything up to the mid 20th century does it. When you only have three parts, you have to work a bit harder to make the harmonies clear and to get your fingers round the notes some chords will come out a bit more open. If you play 4/5-part close harmony like a big band, you will need to lighten the registration a bit (and to make it sound a bit less like a theatre organ and more like a rock or soul organ. But while Hammonds became popular because you CAN do that (and put the bass in too), that’s no reason why you should do it. If you happen to play with a band, we’re back to the ideal one-armed player: let the bass play the bass, the guitar play chords and then put your solo on that. Next verse, the guitar plays the solo and you comp the chords, preferably above or below the guitar so your frequencies don’t clash so much. Less is more; you can do a blues solo on two notes if you’ve a mind to (and if you haven’t a mind it’s safe ...).Hope that’s useful!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=121182&sid=5101abae1840e63b7adbe98e4d344fbf#p121182

Yes you will need to do a binary comparison of the files. And yes it will probably take many trials. Most likely you can reduce the number of test significantly by setting the drawbars to, let's say, 1 and to 8 per drawbar and work out what would be the values in between and test that.

Isn't that MIDI notes?OK, it sounds like You want to record the C2D sounds as You play them.Let's take this from the beginning...Then You'd want to connect the C2D output Left/Right jacks into some kind of sound interface, which is then connected to the computer by USB or Firewire or something, where the DAW records them.A sound interface can look something like this:The 2 cables coming from C2D output Left/Right would connect to the channel 1 and 2 as seen in the top picture above, and (assuming the sound interface is installed correctly) the DAW will then be able to recognize them and allow You to record them in combination as a stereo track into a song.The sound interface would also probably be connected to some kind of speaker system via the Line Outputs on the back panel so that You can hear the song playback while recording. Or if You'd listen through headphones connected to the sound interface.MIDI is something else completely. MIDI is digital registrations of which keys were pressed at what time, how hard, etc. But there are no actual sounds saved in MIDI. It's like saving very detailed sheet music, but not the sounds.This is useful if playing for example SW synths inside the DAW, where the C2D could function as a pure keyboard without using any of the sounds actually produced by the C2D (probably with the volume off on the C2D).MIDI can also be useful for post-recording tweaking, since the notes, timing and key acceleration can be edited afterwards, and then re-fed into the C2D as if there was a ghost player playing everything again, but edited into perfection, and the sounds coming out of the C2D again recorded into the DAW, but now flawless.I don't think the C2D can transmit MIDI via USB (unless I found an outdated version of the manual). You'd need to use the dedicated MIDI output, which would probably also be connected via a sound interface, as can be seen on the back panel of the example above.But judging from Your questions I don't think recording MIDI is what You're after at this point.Go for just recording the actual C2D sounds first.

A stereo sound track.You can do all the SOUND editing You want to this track. Cut, copy, duplicate, effects like EQ, reverb, etc. Sound stuff...2. A MIDI track.Here You can move the key registrations for each individual key press, or change key acceleration.Or You can put in key presses completely from clicking around with the mouse of the computer.And anything in between.BUT... The changes You make on the MIDI track 2) will not affect the recording on the sound tracks 1).And vice versa - if You cut up the sound track into something different this will not affect the MIDI track (unless You make the changes to both in unison).So if You'd record ""live"" and want to use the (edited) MIDI track to re-record You'd actually record the sound from scratch again.You could record it into the same track that You edited so that You get the same effects and settings that You tweaked out, but the new recording would replace the original recording.It's just that it would be the MIDI track playing ""ghost"" into the C2D, which turns into sound inside the C2D, which is recorded back into the DAW again. Kind of a loop.But start with just getting sound recording working.MIDI tweaking is probably level 2, and You can get into it by adding 1 or 2 MIDI cables between the sound interface and C2D at any time (assuming You go for a sound interface that has MIDI in/out).",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=115767&sid=5101abae1840e63b7adbe98e4d344fbf#p115767

One use-case for the TF&W (instead of the T&F) would be when driving it with a keyboard that provides either stereo acoustic piano, epiano or organ sounds, followed by a Vent.  The Vent only uses the R/MONO input for the rotary effect, so driving it with a stereo signal will not alter the resulting output.  It isn't clearly stated in the TF&W manual, but It appears that it has two separate paths of distortion; each input is paired with an output.  With the Vent and TF&W enabled, an overdriven organ would be simulated.  With the Vent bypassed and the TF&W enabled,  the TF&W could be used to overdrive a stereo epiano sound.  Both Vent and TF&W could be bypassed for an undistorted stereo signal, e.g. acoustic piano.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=115637&sid=5101abae1840e63b7adbe98e4d344fbf#p115637

It is well known that the same basic sound engine is at the heart, so in theory you should be able to dial the same tones, but in my experience there is so much more to fiddle with on the V2 that not only is it far less intuitive - for my money leaving all the controls at 12 noon (except overdrive to taste) did the trick on the first gen Vent - but it never seems to be how you left it upon breaking the unit out to use! The controls seem far more likely to move in transit, including plunging the thing into editor mode and requiring lots of corrective editing 15 mins before showtime!Re Leslie fore/aft reverb - my intention is to buy a TC Hall of Fame reverb and feed it in stereo from my eventual choice of Leslie sim (probably a Strymon Lex as I don't like the Mk 2 Vent).

I tried to arrange all of my programs by some sort of category, but it became too time consuming and painful to keep organized.If you have a Nord Stage 3, page 28 of the user manual explains it well.  In Song Mode, a ""Song"" is a set of pointers (referred to as ""Song Parts"") to existing programs.  There are 8 banks of songs with 50 songs per bank and each bank can have 5 Song Parts each.  If I did the math right, that allows you to have 2,000 pointers to existing programs.  And being able to easily arrange them in banks makes it very convenient.I use Song Mode to organize my favorite programs, e.g. ""My Pianos"", ""My EPianos"", ""My Pads"", ""My Strings"", ""My Brass"" etc.I also use Song Mode to arrange sets.  If I know the set list that I'll be playing as well as the order we will play the tunes,  I'll create a Song that has all of the Song Parts intuitively arranged so I only have to push one button to get set up for the next song we are going to play.  And with Nord's seamless transitions, it makes moving from one song to another really smooth.I've also used Live Mode, which is an awesome feature.  On the NS3 you have 5 Live Mode slots, where you can put your favorite, most used sounds, e.g. a piano, an electric piano, an organ, etc.  The only thing you need to remember with Live Mode is thatanychange you make is immediately saved (as opposed to Songs and Programs, where you have to explicitly save them).  (The only thing I haven't figured out with Live Mode yet is how to name them -- they show up as ""Live 1"", ""Live 2"", etc.)Now of course, if you are not using the Nord Stage 3, you may need to forget what I said!.  This is my first Nord, so I don't know if other Nord keyboards have the same features.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=104333&sid=5101abae1840e63b7adbe98e4d344fbf#p104333

Reading the different forums MIGHT be helpful, but remember : it's the sound that YOU are looking that is important.

Ultimately it is down to personal preference around choice of sound and your requirements around portability, price, layout etc.Here are some of my views for what its worth:I currently have a Hammond XK3C Pro System(2 manuals with the wooden stand),and 25 note midi pedals which is ok apart from the C3 Chorus Vibrato sound, which I have tried to get to like but can't.Tried the KeyB Duo Mark3 and the overall sound is pleasing but somewhat ""hyped"". Played through a high quality PA system with 2 subs and satellite speakers, sounded huge! Don't like the leslie sim, and is expensive and bulky.The Crumar Mojo and Hamichord MC3 sound fantastic, both are based on the VB3 software, which offers a high degree of control over the sound. They are based on a Windows PC running inside the organ, and whilst I have not heard of any stability problems, it makes me nervous about using this type of Windows PC technology in a live environment.I am trying out the Nord C2D this weekend, and so far, in my opinion is probably the best compromise in terms of price, sound, portability, build quality, support from manufacturer etc. I am hoping that the Nord fits the bill from a sound point of view, as it would seem to tick all the other boxes for me!Hope this helps.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=17515&sid=5101abae1840e63b7adbe98e4d344fbf#p17515

In a recent clonewheel comparison held by members over in MUSIC PLAYER FORUM, the 3 clones tested were the Mojo, the Nord Stage 2, & the Hammond sk2. They said that sound wise, the Mojo came out on top > However, when a ventilator was hooked up to the Nord & the Hammond, all 3 were equally good in their own respective strengths : the Nord was the brightest sounding clone, & mixed extremely well  other instruments. The Sk2 sounded a tad more 'authentic' (more hammond-like) but was less ballsy, & less suited for Rock/pop/funk. The  essential being that all 3 were equally good when the ventilator was added. As the other members on this forum have stated, it all depends on what your needs are.  As you might have seen on other forums, 'authenticity' on clones is pretty much expected in this day & age . The primary needs of the gigging player these days goes more to the portability , ui, & leslie sim emulation . Since a sizeable amount of players add the vent or a real leslie,( or a Motion sound) to their clones, the differences between the clones is less of a factor to many when it comes to how 'good' it is. Many of the clones today are moving towards perfecting the original TONEWHEEL sound of the Hammond BEYOND the basic capabilities of the Tonewheel Hammond.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=17530&sid=5101abae1840e63b7adbe98e4d344fbf#p17530

I have a cupboard full of pipe organ music for an organ just like this, would be so nice to have an opportunity to practice that at home too.

Between the 3-band equalizer, reverb effects, amp modeling, delay, vintage 1-4 and other options in the ""sound"" menu, it should be possible to make it sound almost any way you like.  And then you get to your own board or amp, which can further modify the sound. And nothing I've seen is so light, and one-package portable.  You can't make it sound like everything all the time, but it should be possible to make it sound like almost anything you want.  And the programmimg is simple, and fast.  It won'tautomaticallymake the right Hammond sound right out of the box, but you can probably get it to make the sounds you want without driving yourself crazy in the process. Remember, any external sounds you desire can be played through the Midi keyboards of the C2.  The Nord also updates through a simple USB hookup, and we've already seen Nord is not selfish about supplying organ updates to owners of older instruments when possible.I've had mine for about 7mos and it seems to be as solid as a brick!Another thing which just occurred to me: When I first got mine, before I had really learned how to set it up, and how it should work with my amps, all kinds of people were telling me how much like a Hammond Leslie it sounded, and looking back, it sounded pretty bad then.  So between one thing and another, I don't think you can really go wrong if you choose the Nord C2/C2D.  And if you can get hold of decent Leslie to play it through, you're 3/4 of the way there, as soon as you turn it on.  Using amps, and/or PA and  leslie sim can get a bit more complicated.From what I've seen, when you add it all up, you can't lose with the C2/C2D",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=19461&sid=5101abae1840e63b7adbe98e4d344fbf#p19461

I'm also Brazilian and fond of B3 sounds, just have 56 years and 38 in music. At the moment, acquired a Crumar Burn Italian Electronic Digital Leslie Multieffector, very close to a Ventilator, trying to modificate my national Tokai TX5 61 Keys Waterfall Plus. My Lower is a weighted P95 Yamaha 88 Keys. My Pedal is a 13-note antique Minami Midi with a Behringer Stereo Volume, heard in a PX100 Sennheiser auriculars - my JBL Monitor Ones or amplified monitors just don't deliver adequate dimension and flatness to organ sounds.Before the Crumar have uselesly tried to tweak internal parameters of this organ - and notice they are really formidable and many(!): 91 or 82 wheels, normal or flat loudness, types of organ, types of click, resonance, microphone distance, woofer size, velocity of horn, etc. - and have no achieved a good fast leslie response, more a vibrato sense of motion, distortion not so good. My reference was my old italian Giannini 2-rotor 100 Watts Leslie with my old Farfisa Professional Duo.Now, tried to abandon Leslie at all in my Tokai keyboard and I'm experimenting with the new Burn. The Fast got much better, not the Slow. But, surprisingly, if I mixture vibrato and chorus more this fast Burn Leslie the result is thunderous!! The distortion of the valve also was overall better!Well. By now I'm just deciding to change for a better keyboard, instead of two. To the extent I perceive this in reality doesn't exist. There are limitations and nuances in all the possibilities.For example, If I buy a fantastic Mojo, will have to get rid of my organ at least and this one just will serve to my tastes, not to gig - in São Paulo we gig with pianos in general. If I buy a C2D, will gain also a pipe organ, but, again, won't serve me to gig. Equally, a Hammond Xk-1c will be a perfect Hammond, but with just an unique set of drawbars. And with a Nord Stage HA76, more expensive, I must get ride of my 2 keyboards and will gain the best of various worlds: organ, synth, piano and no good drawbars at all. A Numa is cheaper and the sound is fantastic, closer to a Hammond, but has just a set of drawbars, pity! Would have to gig with my Yamaha again.Lets wake up!

I have a Nord C2 (updated to C2D sound engine) and a Crumar Mojo. The following are just my opinions. The Crumar Mojo is less expensive than a new C2D. The Mojo offers a more realistic action, perhaps superior tonewheel simulation, and perhaps superior percussion/chorus. The Mojo offers 22 different tonewheel sets (so you're getting 22 different organs) that are easily accessible using a monitor and mouse plugged into the back of the organ.The Leslie simulation is good but I play the Mojo using a real Leslie 3300 and don't use the simulator unless I'm using headphones. So, with my chopped Hammond C3 I can't plug in headphones let alone have a working Leslie in the phones which is one of the real joys of the C2 and the Mojo. To my ears, the Mojo sim sounds more warbly (like it's going to make you seasick) under the phones than the Nord sim. Both are lacking on Leslie fast IMHO when played thru external amplification unless it's a real Leslie.I have a Nord C2 so perhaps the action is different from the C2D. My C2 is quite stiff and springy not at all like a real Hammond- more like an electric piano IMHO. But, I am used to it and have gigged for years with it. The Nord C2 IMHO is better built and 100% reliable. I have found that when I go into the shift mode on the Mojo it can do some crazy stuff so I have stopped using it to change parameters. I simply use the Hammond side of the instrument cause if I need electric piano or any thing else my Nord Stage 2 EX is far superior for those sounds and also 100% reliable. For me, the C2 is easier to carry and fit under my arm. The Mojo is slightly heavier and wider.In short they are both really cool and have their own personalities. Really love them both but the Mojo will be less expensive than a new C2D. Just remember it may not be the reliable tank that the C2 is when you start using the edit functions.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=102564&sid=5101abae1840e63b7adbe98e4d344fbf#p102564

I simply go out 1/4"" into the 3300 and disable the rotary sim on the organ just as I do with the Nord. For me, the button drawbars were never an issue, just something less to break off. And, some people prefer the layout and design of the C2 over the C2D. I love using the Hammond programs in the C2 plus the 3 preset buttons on top of the drawbuttons. This is different than the C2D and truly convenient. IMO the C2 is not outdated and the proof is in the sound, playability, and reliability.

Extending this convo a little further, anyone used the GSi DMC-122 with the Gemini module installed?My research suggests its potentially more versatile than the Mojo or even the Mojo 61 plus lower manual.We had been looking at a C2D for our Church. As one of the main ""organists"" felt the C2D inappropriate as a pipe organ for hymns and preferred a very costly refit/conversion of our old Johannus into a Hauptwerk console I started looking further.  As I see no value in the refit. I had specifically proposed the C2D as an alternative as it will be infrequently used for this purpose (hymns, and some incidental music, perhaps only a couple of times per month).That said she praised the C2D for its versatility and range of sounds and said we should have one.  (I think she somehow thought the C2D was more like the other Nord products that run and organ ++, and that the C2D was a dual manual version of those).That set me thinking and amongst other things, this thread sent me to Crumar and thence to GSi (same company, different branding etc). The Mojo, and especially the Mojo 61, are more the things she thought the C2D to be.The GSi DMC-122 is arguably the better controller keyboard for Hauptwerk installed on a PC.The frustration with all the Crumar/GSi Gemini Pipe organs is that they are emulations of a single manual Baroque unit, without bass pedal functionality.   So Hauptwerk, or a sample set in operating in Kontakt (which I like the look of)https://www.spitfireaudio.com/shop/a-z/ ... pel-organ/would be more necessary in this instance.On the DMC-122 with Gemini, you can at least run the pipe organ on both manuals and select different stops, but it is the same selection of stops.Interested in any comments.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=103657&sid=5101abae1840e63b7adbe98e4d344fbf#p103657

136432,13,5101abae1840e63b7adbe98e4d344fbf,p93382,Nord C2D Pipe Organ - a review for fussy pipe organists,21345,Ohnepiston,2017-11-18T15:24:26+00:00,False,,"My primary interest in the C2D was its seamless integration of a pipe organ with a tonewheel emulator. There are many great Hammond emulators but the pipe organ side of thing is often understandably overlooked due to the comparatively small size of the market. (The Vox and Farfissa emulations seem to suffer the same fate but nobody seems to care that much). So what follows is a fussy and fastidious review about the C2D's Pipe Organ, written by a pipe organist for other pipe organists:While the Nord C2D as a pipe organ will not compete with a custom built console with tracker action keys, expensive multi-channel amps, and an expensive computer running Hauptwerk, the sounds of the stops alone put it on comparable footing to the entry level offerings of studio/practice organs by companies like Allen, Rodgers, Johannes, etc. You'd probably find that you prefer the keyboard action in instruments by these companies. That's fair. Remember that the C2D weighs less than 35 pounds and can be carried under one arm. Even the most sparing Hauptwerk setup will be more difficult to move.The disposition is thoughtful and sensible. The swell division has a nice principle chorus of a more delicate nature built on the Fugara 8, Principal 4. The swell's Rohrflote 8 is pleasantly bright and together with a Spitz 4 and Flote 2, the flute chorus is delightful. The Vox celeste 8 blends richly with either. The mutations in the Nasat and Scharff provide ample opportunities for adding brilliance. Personally, I would have preferred a Swell division comprised entirely of flutes up to and including a 1-3/5 for more options for constructing cornets but... whatever. The Great has as strong principle chorus, a thin and bright Gamba 8, and a woody Gedackt that has an almost overwhelming low register but a bright and airy upper. The Quinta and Mixtur are nice and strong. The Pedal division is limited to a boomy Subbas 16 which becomes a Fagot 16 when the drawbar is fully extended, and a Gedackt 8. The Reeds, an Oboe 8 on swell or Trumpet 8 on Great, like many produced from speakers, sound silly when played solo. In combination with other stops however they open up nicely. The Gamba 8 and Trumpet go together very nicely for example, the Gamba adding just the right amount of body to an otherwise silly, nasal, trumpet sound.The couplers enable loads of possibilities, from adding pipes at 16' pitch on the swell or coupling the swell at 16' pitch to the Great (great for French classical music!) to coupling the manuals in various configurations. There's also a handy 4' coupler on the Swell which works as a useful stand-in for various mutation registrations.Couple of caveats. Depending on the number of stops you have pulled, and the number of keys you depress on the keyboard, you may find that your polyphony is limited. The compounding processing power required to play one note per stop pulled per key depressed eats up CPU like crazy. It's common in many electric organs to begin limiting the individual notes played as the organ gets fuller. That said, unless you're playing massive full organ chords with all ten fingers, toes, and your nose I don't think you'll notice. I haven't noticed. Nord is clear about this on their website without getting into details.So there it is. It's a great little practice organ! I has precise, unforgiving action (perfect for practice!!). It has a very sensible set of registration possibilities for a variety of styles of pipe organ music, and most importantly, it does all of this with an AMAZINGLY SMALL, easily transportable footprint!! You pull drawbars instead of stop levers. You push buttons instead of pistons. There's no fussing with 3 power switches and the occasional MIDI mishap.  As my British friends might say, ""I'm absolutely chuffed!""So, if you've read this all the way to the end, I'm sorry you're such an organ geekAnd many thanks to the other Pipe Organists on here who have made small comments about the C2D's pipe organ from time to time. You were all crucial in helping me find a practice organ.EDIT: RE: NORD PK27 Pedal Keys 27 Midi Bass Pedals --- (had a few requests and I'm sorry I neglected it originally):The pedals are obviously front hinged which gives them a different playing ""feel"" than a traditional rear-hinged pedalboard. Then again, it only weighs 35ish pounds so...? Pedal spacing is approx. 2.5' on center, approx 17.5 for an octave which is par for the course for AGO spec. Obviously it's not a convex or radiating board but as a flat pedal board it's wonderful for practice. My feel are USA size 11 and I find the pedals are long enough to make heel/toe and legato playing on the natural keys possible. If you have massive feet, or if you're accustomed to playing further back from the sharp keys on a traditional pedalboard your experience may differ. If you were only interested in learning to play pipe organ the Nord would be an adequate solution up until a point, after which you'd probably start to feel limited by it. That said, as someone who is predominantly a pipe organist, I find the Nord Pedals to be a VERY convenient solution.At the very least, the light weight and easy action make them FABULOUS for stomping out bass lines.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=93382&sid=5101abae1840e63b7adbe98e4d344fbf#p93382

I still feel that the C2 pipe instrument is a diamond in the rough. While imperfect, it does much of what a more expensive instrument can do in a very compact design. I have yet to find anything that has coupling features that the Nord c2 has. And the hammond sk model pipe organs IMHO are much harder to set up to do pipe organ pieces beyond simple registrations, the sounds are good on those as well.I was really hoping that the new Nord stage3 pipe organs would be a nice compliment to the C2 to expand the stop list but so far I continue to only use the c2 by itself. That being said, using the new stage 3 by itself, between the samples and the new pipe sounds you can get some massive sounding “full” registration organ sounds.Any other pipe organ players with insight?",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=93605&sid=5101abae1840e63b7adbe98e4d344fbf#p93605

I have an interest in Jazz, Blues and especially classical pipe organ.  Going back decades, I pondered/fantasized about putting together a pipe organ practice setup: two MIDI keyboard manuals and a pedalboard all hooked up to a couple of rack samplers.  The price for a makeshift setup was rather high.  The price for an Allen or other ready-made digital pipe organ was even higher. The pedalboard was the most expensive piece for many years, with a quality board going for many thousands of dollars.  So I held off.But now, things have changed.  The C2D appears to offer credible voices and a credible dual manual keyboard—at a very reasonable price.  And you can get a decent pedalboard for under two grand (or so I perceive). What would have cost me probably ten grand in the 1980’s (in today’s dollars) and been a veritable kluge, would today cost me maybe less than half that, and be a rather elegant setup (comparatively).I have a bunch of guitars and basses sitting around that I rarely play, and am pondering selling/trading toward a C2D and pedalboard.  But then I saw the thread about Nord maybe having an upgrade (C3?) secretly on the drawing board: maybe with pistons and/or motorized drawbars, and maybe other pipe-friendly features (another volume pedal jack?) and I wonder should I hold off.

I agree with pretty much all of that, and it is a great practice organ, effectively thrown in for free with the Hammond and Vox organs (and the Farfisa for the two guys who wanted that). That said, I’ve used it live and, just like using a Hammond clone, 99.something% of people don’t know the difference. I use PA rather than hi-if speakers, with sub and satellites, and once in a church acoustic, some of the sounds that sound a bit crummy on headphones sound more natural (this is in a 13th century village church in England). But of course, the times I need the trumpet solo are few, and after the few basic stops on the church’s own organ, it’s bracing in a medicinal sort of way (small doses work best). I’ve not run into polyphony problems, but tend to use it as a baroque organ, not a romantic one.Overall, I think you get an organ like most real ones, where there are nearly always a couple of stops that don’t get used much, for any sort of reason but often because they go badly out of tune, or they’re too loud to integrate in most registrations.My next project is to get a worship band together, and I’ll probably be in Hammond mode for that. But nice to know a touch  of a button brings back the pipe sounds. Or I might use a piano module...The few organists I’ve talked to about the Nord have decided it doesn’t work before they’ve tried it themselves, but when you can actually carry the thing one-handed, and get it and its speakers in a small car, they are rather missing the point!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=94435&sid=5101abae1840e63b7adbe98e4d344fbf#p94435

You can see the note(s) ""contact"" is made via the oval shaped, rubber covered, switches mounted to a circuit board.  My guess is, it's not a single, long circuit board but a series of say 1 octave to a board.Another guess is, there is a failure of your dead key contact.  So, if you remove both sides, then remove the top panel (carefully), observing where to unplug ribbon connectors, you can likely ""see"" the contact in question.  From there, it will depend on how skilled you are to ""test"" the connection of the switch.  If you're right, and there's cracked solder joint, you may be able to repair.

Have to believe most players leave the rotary switch on the organ, and plugged in - cable neatly tucked or taped out of harms way.  Thing is, the jack is on the back side which ultimately becomes the 'bottom' when in a case that's turned upright for carrying or loading in a car.  Perhaps relocate the jack or at least recess it somewhat so no weight is resting on the plug.  2nd point - for such an ingenious instrument that i'm totally awed by, how can NORD place it at the mercy of such a cheap and vulnerable plastic accessory jack?!?

However, this proved to be inadequate for the group I am with now (guit, dr, sax, bone, org/bass).  I looked around for a bass ROMpler and bought a 90's era Roland M-BD1 module and a MIDI Solutions Event Processor Plus.  The EPP was programmed to adapt C2D patch changes to control selected patch changes in the M-BD1.  I programmed about a dozen usable bass sounds but actually use only 4 or 5.

I'm the organist and it's been an AMAZING setup for us.But for the past few weekswe've had a problem- at completelyrandomtimes (at least they're random to me, I can't seem to find a cause or common denominator), the sound sort of ""cuts out."" Only, it doesn'tcompletelycut out, it's actually as if the expression pedal has been pushed down to 0% volume (i.e. we can still hear some of the sound, just like at 0%). I have to move the expression pedal to a different volume position to get it to jump back.And yes, I'm positively CERTAIN that it's the organ cutting out (and not the mixer, snake, or DI box), because(1)no other instruments or mics are cutting out, and(2)when I go to the settings and I go to where I can see the pedal volume percentage,when it cuts out, the volume number on the organ's screen actually goes to 0%, then jumps back to whatever percentage it was at before when I move the expression pedal a little.It's very frustrating. It doesn't happen just when all the other instruments are playing, so I don't think it's an overload problem. I don'tTHINKthat any of our wireless mics are interfering with it, because I've used the organ while they were off and it still happened. It's not a ground loop issue because we've lifted everywhere we possibly can and it still happens. And it's not the expression pedal's fault, because when it first started happening I switched out Nord's included pedal for a Moog EP-3 expression pedal (which I'm still using and happy with), and the problem continued. And I'mpretty sureit's not the expression pedal settings on the organ...I haven't extensively tried each expression pedal setting for long periods of time to see if things change -  that may be the issue, but I don't think so.

Will be running a Korg SV1 and a C2D (I'll be putting it through a Ventilator; I'd bought that for my tonewheel and still get a thrill from the sound of it a few years down the line) and can't wait to get stuck in. As an owner of both an A100 and a Wurly EP200A, I can honestly say that in the Korg and the C2D I have every confidence that both itches will be well and truly scratched.Curiously enough I have been using an E4D and while I loved the sounds, didn't take to the user interface at all. I'm not a tweaker of things, and always seemed to be fighting with the E4D - somehow the drawbars weren't showing the sounds being played because I'd knocked another button etc, or I'd switch from Wurly to B3 and find the overdrive and tremolo hadn't cancelled, that sort of thing. Nothing that five minutes reading the manual wouldn't have fixed, I'm sure.But as soon as I was using the Korg SV1 for my piano sounds, and had the E4D just left as an organ, I started to enjoy the sound of the E4D B3 through the a Neo Vent immensely. It was at this point I realised how it wasn't the sound of the A100 I missed when not using it, but the instant availability of configuration. Hence my reason for buying a C2D which I'm hoping will enable me to retire the A100 for a full rebuild, service and then only usage for special occasions or recording only.Looking forward to chewing the fat!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=54252&sid=ae157628bab362829d8c8e6eba432ea2#p54252

I use a Nord C2D although my profile says C2. Thanks,https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=26721&sid=ae157628bab362829d8c8e6eba432ea2#p26721

It sounds like it was done pretty much live in the studio, which figures for that sort of track. So one way and another, you should be able to get close with a cleanish Hammond sound, maybe 56880000, no Leslie, little or no vibrato and some reverb, but not too big a room. Anyway, start there and pull drawbars and twiddle knobs till you like it.And, heresy though it may be to say so, if you learn the lick and get it right in context, it probably won't matter too much if you're not bang on the sound. People spend months arguing about what organ is featured on what track, and especially when it's a combo-y sort of sound, it's hard to tell. Don't know about Jamaica, but in the UK in the 60s, bands played combos live (to be able to transport them) and often recorded on Hammonds or whatever the studio had...I can hardly believe I'm saving up for a real Hammond now I've said that!Good luck",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=82681&sid=ae157628bab362829d8c8e6eba432ea2#p82681

I'm not an organ player (so far), but I'm very interested in the sound and I'm considering learning it.I was trying to decide between the Electro 5D and the C2D, and was trying to find some information regarding just how much a lower manual may be needed. Unfortunately so far I came up pretty empty. (It's difficult to fins the right google keywords/phrasing...) What I have found was that the lower manual is usually/mostly tuned to the same octaves. So is the difference only that you may have a different drawbar configuration for it? And if yes, is this something you'd miss a lot on the Electro?A slightly related second question: The C2D has two sets of drawbars per manual, while some other brands like the Mojo have only one.

I once owed a Hammond B3 and two manuals is a great plus for the authenticplaying experiences. Sure you can split the Electro keyboard but it is a bit clumsy and the single drawbar layout is as well.I miss the 4 sets of drawbars I once had with my Hammond B3. So if I were to buy again for a more real Hammond experience I would get something with both manuals and 4 sets of drawbars.  Right now I use a Roland A-300Pro and it's sliders on top tier to at least give me instant access to two sets of drawbars on my SK2.My SK2 also has extra voicings (like piano) that I like. I can play organ on top manual and piano on the bottom (or visa versa) with a simple switch push.The piano sounds are not as authentic as my Stage 2 but they suffice. Since I don't have a C2D, I'm not sure if those features exist on that unit.If I ever consider selling my SK2, the C2D woiuld be in the running for a replacement.I've been watching the forum for quite a while and the more I hear about the Electro 5, the happier I am that I chose the Stage 2 EX over it.

For jazz/solo work, having two manuals is another way of compensating for not having touch sensitivity as you do on the piano. SOlo on upper manual, accompaniment on the lower, or just two different settings you can combine with either hand to give variation in dynamics (you can set the drawbars the same on both and have percussion on the upper, for example, then play what you want to empahaisis on the upper manual.For rock and pop work, one manual is usually enough, if you're not doing the whole prog rock Jon Lord thing. I always reckoned my father would have been a great rock/pop organist, as he only had the one arm ... If you play keys in anything other than an organ-based jazz group, you may well get away with the single keyboard, but just as having the real Hammond alters the way you play, so does having two manuals. My ideal would be a B3/C3/A100 and Leslie at home for personal use and having a few people round to play it for me, and having the C2D and a Leslie for gigging (the 3300 is ideal for that, in my view). Even if you can tell the difference between a B3 and the C2D, by the time you have a real Leslie physically moving air, the difference is academic, and in a rock band, it probably doesn't make much difference at all, if you can perform as well on a clone as on the real thing.

If you have all the parts metal latch and screw and the plastic housing is not broken, it should seat. The instructions on re-seating the pedal in the alternate position is not terribly clear either.Thanks, all! I purchased the Yamaha FC7 and it works great. Important to remember, as we discussed with Jason Lollar, that where the master volume is set, and the range the pedal is in, effects the tonal balance of the organ. I'm concluding that I should set my amps so the master volume contrrol is about the 50% mark, and the pedal opened a bit to reach playing volume give right tonal balance.  But this pedal, does what I want. Allows smooth volume changes, or a pop-stab, and thesforzandofeature indicated the going-into-big-distortion point nicely. And it's sturdy.

It's even funnier, and sort of sad, when people think they are worth money.I am stuck on 'unspun reverb'  now.  For the first time, the sound of my C-2 sounds 'bigger' than the sound source (Pro-3x and 15' powered speaker.)  if you know what I mean. With 'spun reverb' the sound seems to sink back into itself when I go to 'tremelo'.   I think it's worth going through some trouble to set it up that way.  It requires an external source of reverb, and an unspun amp and speaker, but digital reverb is inexpensive.The contrast from tremelo to unspun reverb after the note keeps the Leslie effect in the forefront, instead of  'mushing'.Of course, if the Nord had more choices for the reverb route, it would mean more buttons.

This still leaves you with the problem of switching speeds and power on your 147, unless it's been modified to work with a 1/4"" connector. It's also worth mentioning that the 11 pin connector doesn't provide AC power.http://www.captain-foldback.com/Leslie_sub/pinouts.htm",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=80087&sid=ae157628bab362829d8c8e6eba432ea2#p80087

I should have use the same depth a my xb3 but used the c2d measurment which was a misstake.If I build one more i will make it deeper and integrate the sides and front instead od having the loose (although this adds flexibility.I will post the finished result when it's all done.One thing that takes time is to wait for the epxy resin to cure.Since all sides are to be covered this takes at least 24 hours per side.,https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=19894&sid=0020fc2c3f9d8f26d153f38eec99112f#p19894

I was particularly impressed by flmc59's homemade stand - please send pictures when you complete your project.  It looks great so far!  In any event, I wound up purchasing the K&M 18950 stand.  I looked at the On Stage KSA7500 and it seemed flimsy and poorly built - IMHO.  I could not be happier with this stand.  It is a table top stand that is extremely well designed and built with high quality welds.  K&M provides you with rubber adhesive strips to place on the table top cross members and I also purchased some additional rubber anti-skid adhesive pads from Home Depot that I placed on other areas of the stand surface.  I bought the extra rubber pads to provide more anti-skid surface and it will also protect the C2's underside from being scratched.  The height and length of this stand are adjustable and it folds up for transport.  It is 20 or so lbs. - so it is not extremely light but it feels and appears extremely durable and road worthy.  I paid $188 USD plus tax and could not be happier.  I would highly recommend this stand especially for the gigging musician.  There is an insert on two of the supportive cross structures that allow you to add an additional tier if need be for another keyboard or perhaps even a small mixer or laptop.  Availability of this stand was somewhat limited so I had to have my local dealer order it in.  He did have all of the other manufacturese like On Stage, Quick Lok and so on but I could not trust their stands to support my $3K C2.  I personally feel that that the table top design is structurally the strongest design out there.  I know others have had success with there X and Z types but for me they just were not stable enough.

People always trip or stumble on stages.Second, I cut a piece of very nice oak plywood into a rectangle a bit bigger than the span of the legs. The leveling screw-feet removed from the legs, the legs now bolt to the plywood ""sled"", and the pedals (Hammond XPK 200) sits on the sled.Minimum foorprint, very stable.  The disadavatage of course, is the time and complication of bolting the thing together, instead of just unfolding the stand and putting the organ on it.

Since they're made from new wood, you won't be limited as to the color stain you go with. Their B3 legs include what would be the corners of the cabinet. This would have made construction much simpler. My B3 legs are 22"" long and I added about another 5"" with the tops of the stand sides.One more thing, at first I thought about just covering the red wood sides of the C2D with veneer but the edges were rounded off so much I felt it would be difficult to get a tight fit for the veneer at the edges.  So I made new wood sides covered with veneer.

I'm trying to figure out how to best use the stage 2 76 and a c2 all in front of me at once. I have tried virtually every set up and thought I would post my comments on the different configs1. c2 on bottom, stage on top. as close as possible to play both while seated=restricted access to drawbars and other settings on the c2, not good. A little akward to play piano/rhodes etc over two manuals of organ, even if the stage 2 is close/low enough to be comfy.2. C2 on top, slanted downwards, stage 2 on bottom with the c2 relatively close but still high enough to get at the controls on the stage=nice access to c2's drawbars and other controls, a little bit hard to get at the stage 2 controls while still being able to play the c2 seated.3. C2 on top, stage 2 on bottom with the whole stand raised up for standing playing of both boards= easier access to settings on the stage2 because you can step back a tiny bit and look at the controls from a non-seated vantage point. Weird playing the organ/swell pedal standing and with it up that high. The whole thing is a little wobbly and not that reassuring with big palm smears etc.And last night I think that I may have found something that works...4. C2 on bottom for seated playing, stage 2 raised up enough for standing playing. The 2 manuals of the c2 are able to be slid back pretty far because you don't need to get at both boards while playing. (If I need to layer or split to have organ while playing piano, I just use the stage2's organ section.) This set up makes you either stand to play piano or sit to play organ. I think it works really well and allows you to engage with the audience while standing and play organ in a traditional way with the pedals, swell, and the like. I'll post some pics at some point here. Just thought I would share what I have come across... This thread was also useful in getting some ideas for stands. People just go crazy with their set up and it turns out to be much more work and money than finding a way to use an existing product to do what you need.

Consequently the C2D sounds pretty terrible even though I can practice on it. However, I have a small lobby off this room, where our front door is, though we don't generally use it owing to access problems on that side of the house.So, I plan to run a cable from the organ (diagonally opposite in the sitting room from the lobby, naturally) to this lobby and as part of a tidying-up plan, and put some cupboards/shelving in there to hold some of our collection of musical instruments. The instruments will go in the cupboards, but I'll store the satellite speakers for the organ on a shelf and stand the sub on the floor of the lobby itself. So I will be able to play the organ through them and as long as I open the door from the sitting room to the lobby should get a sound as in a smallish church. The Speakers will be 'in storage', so out of the way generally, and the wiring will be concealed between organ and speakers, so it should all be tidier than the general glory-hole the lobby is right now.Having the sub and satellites in use in the sitting room itself is a no-go with the management, but I reckon this whole thing will make everything tidier and give me a chance to play with a decent sound when I want to. Plus there'll be even less wiring at the sitting room end than there is now, and all I have to do is unplug the speakers if I want to gig with them.I'll be running a skinny mike cable round the walls (there's a gap by the wooden flooring which I will cover up with beading - should have done that years ago) and probably running the headphone out through it to the speakers, so I can use an iPod while I'm playing, too. There'll just be a stereo jack on the wall next to the organ, so I can use an insert-type lead to connect the main outs if I decide to do that instead, or if it turns out to be too far for the headphone socket to drive a signal.More on this when it happens - got to get some dosh together to sort the cupboards and shelves, first, but hoping to be on it before January is out.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=66958&sid=0020fc2c3f9d8f26d153f38eec99112f#p66958

Polyphony on the other emulations would be too much (see below), so I didn't try that.There is a setting on the Nord where you can only play one note at a time (with B3 and the other modelled organs) - that's a fairly common thing for bass pedals and even my 1970-something Yamaha combo organ does that if you select the appropriate mode. See 'Synth bass model' in the manual.TBH, I think the issue of what pedals you buy will depend on whether you need an AGO/RCO-style radiating pedalboard to play 19th century and later repertoire for the classical organ. The Nord pedals are great for 18th-century organ music and for the B3, although you may of course prefer a radiating board even for those. In broad terms, heel and toe is a 19th-centuruy and later technique - post JS Bach.As I pointed out elsewhere (look a few threads back), you can get an Italian pedalboard, AGO spec, up to 32 note for about half to two-thirds the price of the Nord pedals. I may buy one myself eventually, but I chose the Nord pedals because having spent a lot of my life using vintage organs with half their original parts missing (especially combo organs with no legs!), I wanted to have the full Nord offering - Keyboard, stand, music rest, case, pedalboard and half-moon switch. I could have done most of that cheaper with other makes, but sometimes you just want to have everything the way they intended it to be ... .",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=62126&sid=0020fc2c3f9d8f26d153f38eec99112f#p62126

I have an A100 that I put a variable resistor in and have been able to dial back the C/V to more of a late 50s B3 vibe. I really wish they could add this functionality in an update. Hammond just did with the SK2. If Nord could do this, the C2D would be the hands-down winner vs. Hammond.I'm pretty sure that there is absolutely no difference between the A100 chorus and the B3 chorus section.The sonic differences between individual consoles due to component tolerances and aging, however, are astounding.Quite, and the B3 was a far longer running model. I think the A100 was discontinued in the late sixties and the B3 limped on until about 1974.You wonder if the difference between individual consoles is as about the same as a console vs a clone these days. It can't be far off, but by the same token probably the case that the difference is one that halves, and halves, but never quite gets there.I've just ordered a C2D to replace my A100 for all but recording and special occasions.

Secondly, on the vibrato, there is this stepwise circular operation. It is completely impossible to change in any kind of reliable way while playing. The reverb is as bad but there I cannot really complain since that function is missing completely on the B3. If Nord produce a new version of C2D with B3 style switches, I would buy it just to get an instrument that not only sounds like a rean B3 but that can be played like one too. This is about the only complaint I have about an otherwise fantastic organ but it is a rather serious complaint for anyone who is used to the original B3 and it is hard to understand why Nord did not design this in a proper way when the rest is so good.

There are two spare pins on a 5-pin DIN plug which would allow power to be sent from the console to the pedals, without preventing the use of other pedals if desired.I'm not thrilled by the C2D official stand - it's lovely to put the keyboard on but it's a sod to put up and take down in a dark theatre. Because of that and the need for the stupid wall-wart with the pedals I generally don't use any pedals at all when I'm gigging - fortunately usually with a bass player of some sort - instead of all that palaver.All those features would add a maybe 1-2% to the cost, but transform the usability, for me at any rate.

Most organs of that era had straight pedalboards and heel and toe playing was not generally used (J S Bach only 'toed'). So having a straight set of pedals like the Nord ones is perfectly in keeping. You wouldn't expect a pedalboard to AGO/RCO standards for B3-type stuff, still less Vox and Farfisa.While you can play later music for church organ perfectly well with the Nord baroque stops (and careful use of the couplers), I think they did a fair job in matching the baroque sound set to the physical organ they already had. You can in fact buy a 30-note radial pedalboard to proper dimensions for about half the cost of the Nord pedals, so if that's your thing, probably best to do that. I'm a UK size 10 (Euro 44) and have no problems with the Nord pedals, but if I were a full-blown church organist I'd probably want a curved set of pedals, if only to match what I'm likely to find in a church (although, as it happens, my local church has a one-octave straight pedalboard which I do find quite difficult. I have taken my Nord into church before, not so much for the pedals as to have two manuals and be able to do echo stuff properly, especially with the trumpet stop.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=60681&sid=0020fc2c3f9d8f26d153f38eec99112f#p60681

I checked in 2013 and unfortunately the Studio12 is not available in Europe due to CE-safety-restrictions. At least, that is what Hammnond-Europe is saying. Maybe they want to sell some 3300's first. Current price (2015) is about 3400 dollar in Germany. The Studio 12 is also not available in Japan. Only if Japan steps in for modification then total market will be large enough. Australia/New Zealand unknown. Can somebody check?Can you import the 12 somehow and change the main power to 230V/50Hz?Suppose if you add some low-end like subwoofer it will work out. The 3300 has some limitations below 70Hz anyway too.See :http://www.organissimo.org/3300review_1.htmThe thing is that The organ bass-freqs can be very low and do not always have that much uppertones.""Back home I decided I would try to determine why the low frequencies of the 3300 were not satisfying with organissimo . I did several tests with a logarhythmic sine-wave sweep from 10Hz to 20kHz using the 3300's 1/4"" line input. Under 40Hz or so, the sound totally drops off. 40Hz itself is quite low in volume. In fact, it isn't until about 70Hz or so that the 3300 seems to really come alive. I did some voltage tests on the back of the 15"" woofer to make sure the amp was actually feeding the speaker those low frequencies and sure enough it is. From my experiments, I think the woofer probably has a usable frequency range starting at only 55Hz or so. It may even be in the upper 50Hz, low 60Hz range. """"For right now, the easiest and least expensive fix is to use the Yorkville NX55P to supplement the bass, via the sub output of the 3300. The combination works very well and sounds great""So I suppose it could also work with the Studio 12.Because wave-lengths below 100Hz are a couple of times longer than the movement of the leslie-components not much extra  is expected from the leslie-effect although I'm not sure how it will work out with together played uppertones by other notes.  At 100Hz the wavelength can be calculated : speed of sound / frequency =343 m/s (or 1115 ft)   /  100Hz = 3.40 meter (or 134 inch). At 50Hz it will be doubled in length. So the wave-shape will not change that much by freq modulation.A leslie 860, a small one, has a 120W solid state. It goes loud enough, but not that deep.  It will keep up with drums.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=60386&sid=0020fc2c3f9d8f26d153f38eec99112f#p60386

This last one B3 Sound, was the one that I was using on my C2.It seems that I was talking about 2 different issues:1) The treble decrease when playing left hand in the swell manual, was more noticeable in the preset called ""evil ways"", that has a very loud ""percussion"" sound. If I add my left hand in the same manual, the percussive sound vanish to copy the behavior of a real Hammond (that is what I'm taking as a conclusion). I'm not very sure if in the C2 was so noticeable.2) The sudden increase/decrease changes, seems to be (for the 2nd time) the low quality potentiometer that has the Nord Pedal Keys volume pedal. Last year, I had a very similar problem when playing with my C2. I showed it to my technician, and he said that the potentiometer was not working well.

I am very close to deciding on purchasing a C2D. It looks to have the best range of features I want from the currently available clonewheels (dual manuals, and I love drawbars!). I currently own a Hammond XK-1C and have previously owned a Hammond XM module as well as an original 1963 Hammond M-111 spinet which I dearly loved. I am also a big fan of vintage combo organs so I'm very interested in the Vox and Farfisa sounds.There were a couple things about the C2D that seemed unclear after reading through the manual. I noticed in one of the O/S updates that you can now adjust the drawbars on preset programs by double clicking the preset buttons (so it's flashing). Is this only allowed for the current drawbar set that's in focus (either A or B)? Or can you also adjust the drawbars for the non-active set while playing the set that's in focus, and then be able to switch between them? Sorry if that question is unclear, hopefully it makes sense.Second, is it not possible to have different organ models on each manual (example: B3 on lower, Farfisa on upper)? From what I understand this is NOT possible, but just wondering if maybe I missed that explanation somewhere. It would be great if that was an option.As for the combo organ sounds, has anyone got any sound clips of the Vox/Farfisa sound library that's available for download on the Nord website? The majority of C2D demos I've listened to only show the combo organ presets very briefly or not at all. There are a couple demos on the Nord site but not really in depth. Are the sounds in the Vox/Farfisa Library set good, any opinions from those who have added them to their C2D?Thanks for any replies.

Much appreciated! That's awesome that you had a Farfisa. I'd love to own a Compact Duo. You're right about the knee lever, those little quirks are what seem to be missing from all the combo organ models. For example, there's no Multi-Tone Booster tab simulation, though I suppose you could dial in something close by tweaking the amp model, overdrive and EQ settings.And, yes, I'm sure that 99.999% of C2D and other clonewheel owners mainly play B3 sounds, but it's nice to have the combos included. The pipe organ is also cool. On my Hammond XK-1C I actually prefer the Vox model to the Farf, even though I like the sound of real vintage Farfisa compacts much more.I saw the video you're referring to. That is a nice demo, but it's really only one patch throughout. The Vox/Farfisa Library set has something like 10 patches, it would be great to hear clips of more of the models.

Most of the ""fizz and bubble"" is given by the playing style: for example, coordinating the use of the expression pedal with changes in leslie speed is a HUGE part of the sound.Generally speaking, you have to get used to the idea that, as opposed to the piano, much (if not most ) of the sound is not produced on the keyboard but by the other controls. You will have your hands and feet busy all the time, and mostly NOT on the keys!Even when you're actually playing the keys it's a totally different game, the keys are light and unweighted and have an instant trigger, allowing for lightning speeds that are unthinkable on a piano... going back to a weighted keyboard after a session on the hammond feels like being stuck in glue!!!And there are so many techniques that are unique to the Hammond: palm smears, ""machine-gun trills"", staccato playing to make the percussion come out or legato playing to suppress it... all these things make up the iconic ""hammond sound"" as much as (or more) than the mere drawbar and C/V registrations.Remeber - Don't think that  because you can play piano, you know anything about organ. You don't.You're learning a totally new instrument, with all the difficulties and frustrations that come with it... but also with all the excitement and discovery and satisfaction.As I told, I'm totally sympathetic with you because I'm in the same situation, a slow heavy-handed elephant of a piano player that's been trying for the last couple of years to get some decent sounds out of my clonewheel, and only now I'm slowly starting to get a grip on it.Be patient and hold on, the results will come... sooner or later!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=56972&sid=0020fc2c3f9d8f26d153f38eec99112f#p56972

The switch knob from a Fender Telecaster makes a much better-looking replacement for the knob on the Nord half-moon switch. Just requires a tiny spot of glue. Looks more authentic.2. The Nord organ gigbag is huge and heavy. The Gator GKB-61 gig bag offers less protection and doesn't have wheels but is MUCH lighter and less bulky.

Don't forget to turn off the onboard Leslie sim.I also have a Hammond SK2 which does not have the 11 pin hookup. It's not as natural as playing the C2 thru the 3300.I think you'll love it. One word of caution. I think I damaged my first 3300 by turning the tube pre-amp on the Leslie up too much. That is a problem especially if you ""lend"" the 3300 to some one. Just take it easy with the tube preamp on the Leslie 3300 and you'll be okay.Otherwise, I have found it to be perfectly balanced.

The complexity of the reflections in a room can not be reproduced by a PAIf you are playing loud rockclubs with a miked Lelsie and if you are going to use a Rhodes sound o other sounds in PA then the PA route will work well.If you are going to play venues where you would normally use a Lelsie and not go through the PA then I would go for the Leslie. The improvement in 3D sound is big.I have tested to use the c2d in a church in a PA and it works fine but for my personal plesure maximation then I bring my 145.If you want to go light then try the Motion Sound pro 145 that Jeker still might have in stock. I have a pro3 tm top with a lowpro rotor and it sounds surprisingly good. Specially when I add my cube 60 for extened bottom end.Before buing gear I think the wise thing is to understand onesRequirements of the system.Where is it to be used.Is sound top prioIs portability top prioAnd to realise that Sound and Portability are often in conflict.,https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=22058&sid=0020fc2c3f9d8f26d153f38eec99112f#p22058

He was polite, of course, but his voice had a 'why on earth am I still getting calls about this?' quality to it.I'll never forget what my friend Barry, an electronics technician by trade, said when he saw the inside of my Motion Sound Pro-3X: ""That isn't a manufactured product, it's a science-fair project!""Given that the 3300isn'tin the usual wooden cabinet, I was afraid it would sound different than the more traditional Leslies,  possibly harsh or shrill. After the Motion Sound experience, I'm not taking any chances! Just because something has a horn which twirls doesn't make it a Leslie! There's more to it than that.  But those who know, like Jim Alfredson, all are unanimous in saying the 3300 is very close to a 122 tonally.  And nobody seems to be saying that the 3300 and a Nord organ don't work well enough together.  Maybe it will sound good with my CV.At any rate, I've learned a lot about Hammond (and clonewheel ) organ sound in the last couple of years, and it comes down to this:  When you set the organ to 888, perc. or 88800008 or 8888 and play it,( the standard settings) you've got tolovethe sound of it, even playing a single note or chord, and each octave should have its own attractions.If it doesn't make asoundthat you love, the battle is half lost.  It's very hard to play past an organ sound I don't like. If I don't want to hear it, why should anybody else?  So much of how the Hammond-style organ is played is for the sheer sound of it, too the glisses, the crushes, hits, thumps, screams, the Leslie effect which comes sweepin' down the plain on run-up, and the Doppler train that leaves the station with two lights on behind on run-down.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=43613&sid=0020fc2c3f9d8f26d153f38eec99112f#p43613

Now they sound rich, and each note is delineated.Okay, there's a quality I call ""Les""  (pronounced ""lezz"") which is what makes a Hammond organ on 888 sound so good through a Leslie.  Well, my  friend's 21H  ($50!!) has the most les I ever heard,  the 3300 doesn't have that much, but it has enough to make the C2 sound right, and that subwoofer outlet is fantastic.  Simply by sending it out to a keyboard amp or powered monitor gives the bass impact, but it's not like the bass is inadequate.The stock tube is way too hot, it gives me mid level distortion at the lowest setting.

Here's a tip:  The casters make it difficult to handle the 3300 with a hand-truck.  A piece of 4x4 lumber (which is actually 3 and 5/8 or something) about a foot long between the casters is just right to take up that gap, and the cabinet rests flat on the handtruck. Strap the Leslie to the handtruck with woven straps, away you go.And do buy the cover from Hammond.  It's actually a real bargain at $79.

137251,13,0020fc2c3f9d8f26d153f38eec99112f,p56281,More Complete Documentation?,13020,china88,2015-04-21T13:47:01+00:00,False,,"A:  Is there a publication for the C2D that specifies what controls pertain to which organ personality -- as well as what controls are ""universal"" or generic and can be used with any/all four organ personalities?  That would be extremely helpful for a newbie like me (and perhaps others) to quickly get their arms around exactly what controls are used for the B3, Pipe, Vox, Farfisa.The manual only obliquely alludes to a few controls, but falls far short of explicitly describing this information.Here are two analogies to this issue:1. Expecting someone to fly a 747 airplane: The instruction manual says that it can take off (B3), and it can land (pipe); but it doesn't tell you what specific controls you need to use for each of those different actions. Not very useful, is it?2. Learning a new program language with numerous commands, but no syntax description is provided for how to use those commands.Customers are not mind readers on how to use this complex product. Clavia should provide details that helps us successfully use it. Knowledgeable and happy customers are their best (and Free) source of promotion for their products,  as are unhappy customers.B:  I also discovered that when going from the C2 to the C2D, the Music Stand EX that worked on the C2 was not adequate for the C2D. Turns out that when installed the music stand lower shelf covered all the legends on the top rear of the C2D. I'm surprised that nobody at Clavia thought to check this out.My Solution: I made two 1"" square wood blocks as spacers and put them in between the music stand mount blocks and the back of the C2D - using 1"" longer metric screws. This moved the music stand about 1/2"" beyond the back of the organ so the bottom tray wasn't covering all the printed legend information on the top rear of the organ.  This also permits me to install the keyboard cover even with the music stand installed. However, I found that I had to cut sections out of the back of the keyboard cover so it would slide around the extensions. It would be to Clavia's best interest to offer free upgrades (in the form of thicker mounting blocks and longer attaching screws) for all C2D customers who request it. Having the rear of their C2D facing the audience (and perhaps potential customers) is not going to be impressive when it looks like a ""Sanford and Son"" kluge.  Perhaps even modifying their keyboard cover as mentioned above as ""standard"" would be beneficial?C:  Another unpleasant surprise was that my half-moon switch which was used on the C2 wouldn't work on the C2D in the low speed - and it wasn't intuitively clear what was causing the problem. Turns out the ""default"" menu settings were responsible for this.  Clavia would be better served by having the half-moon switch set as the Default, rather than something else because most people are going to use the half-moon switch.  Thankfully, our excellent support person in the U.S. (Pablo Mastodon) helped me to zero in on how/where to solve this problem.D:  The only thing they can do better is to consider emulating the Hammond X-77 GT. This was a solid state version of the B3 on steroids that I sold and selected the C2 as the replacement.  The X-77 GT had two sets of 11 drawbars for the upper keyboard, two sets of 10 drawbars for the lower keyboard, and four drawbars for the pedal keyboard.E:  For the C2D product, they should include Tubular Bells/Chimes. This is because churches worldwide are faced with declining contributions and hefty prices to maintain their pipe organs. Having a C2D address this nicely. However, the lack of tubular bells is a deal-breaker because all worship consists of using tubular bells. They could have a special emulation that offers tubular bells on one keyboard only and in a two octave range. They could put it in the spot of empty program #105 and the church organist could ""copy"" the favored pipe organ profile into spot #106. This makes it easy to switch from pipe organ and tubular bells.I believe that if Clavia redesigned their C2D into a ""C2De"" (""enhanced"" version with the above inclusions), they would be the market leader that no one could touch. (are you marketing geniuses listening?)Beyond these issues, this is an incredible (but still lacking) instrument and for me... a keeper.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=56281&sid=0020fc2c3f9d8f26d153f38eec99112f#p56281

With regard to publications, the manual really does do a fairly good job of fully describing these functions, although admittedly they do not provide a ""cross-reference"" between these different model configurations in the condensed format you seem to suggest.  The Farfisa, for example, has more limited chorus/vibrato choices than the Hammond.  This is described fully and completely in the section on Farfisa, as are the differences in drawbar function (stops on the Farfisa).  I'm afraid that your first analogy doesn't fly with me; the second one just doesn't compute.B.  I am not privy to internal Nord discussions on such issues, but in this instance the music stand and bracket design pre-dated the C2D development by several years.  It was inherited from the C2, which was inherited from the C1.  Yes, this is a detail which merits some attention, but I suspect that their focus was more on the instrument itself than the music stand or the dust cover.  Also, I strongly suspect that there are engineering considerations there which should not be taken lightly.  Extending those brackets out 2.5cm will result in a significantly longer moment arm on the load transfer point between the music stand itself and the points where those brackets mount to the instrument chassis.  A few scant bits of sheet music will not present a big load, but some may start loading up their music stands with multiple hymnals of considerable weight.  Over time, this will weaken those joints and perhaps cause failure.C.  The half-moon switch is an optional accessory and may stretch some musos' budgets further than they wish to go.  It simply makes no sense to create a default factory setting which assumes that folks will be purchasing that optional accessory.  The factory default setting works with the instrument as is out of the box, which is as it should be.  Can you imagine the outcry which would ensue if this were the other way around as you suggest?  People would feel as though they were being pressured to buy the accessory.D/E.  Reasonable people can differ on what is better and what is not.  One of Nord's primary goals here is to keep it simple and not clutter it up with lots of, dare I say, bells and whistles.  There are plenty of other companies doing that already.  Plus, Nord has other models which will happily produce all the bells and whistles which one can imagine (and which will allow the user to easily create new bells and whistles of her/his own imagination).  Also, I think it is fair to say that ""all worship consists of using tubular bells"" is a highly disputable statement.Bless,PabloPS -- welcome to this forum!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=56288&sid=0020fc2c3f9d8f26d153f38eec99112f#p56288

I spent many years in IT and while I've always been able to find what I need in a manual, many people really do find it difficult. That said, the one thing I sometimes fail to find in documentation is a categoric statement about something you can't find out for yourself without far too much trial and error - things like what gets lost if you lose power, or whether stereo outputs get properly summed to mono. Stuff you can find out, but probably not quickly or easily.I do recognise that these are things a lot of people won't be worrying about too much, but I can, for example, find out how loud it gets by turning up the volume a lot quicker than I can find out how catastrophic a power cut will be ...While we're talking possible improvements, it would be nice to have easily deployable sound sets to replace the baroque organ samples, but again this is going to be a niche interest. The music rest issue is certainly there, but I should think a lot of players have their own stands anyway - I do have the Nord music rest but I already had a wide music stand when I bought it and still use the separate one sometimes.What I would like is a frame of some sort that links the Nord keyboard stand with the Pedal keys 27 and a stool so that I can set up with pedals and a stool without having to line everything up manually to be sure the pedals are in the right place.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=56790&sid=0020fc2c3f9d8f26d153f38eec99112f#p56790

If this is the case, then the Nord can't supply enough level to allow the amplification to produce its maximum volume level. In this case a mixer or preamp that can produce a +4dB output will boost the level of the Nord quite substantially - enough to drive your amplification properly so that you can get the full volume out of it.

The extra control is well worth having, though going straight into active speakers is pretty good. The payoff, though, is having extra inputs should you need more keyboards or a mike, for example, and boing able to warm up the signal a bit if you want to bring the roof down.Of course, if your budget is limited, it's not totally essential, but you can get a small mixer for about 5% of the C2D's cost, so well worth considering unless you only ever use the thing at home or in one situation where none of none of these things could ever apply.And if you gig with others, you do have a two-channel DI, don't you?",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=49437&sid=0020fc2c3f9d8f26d153f38eec99112f#p49437

While it does have a USB port, this predates their Sound Manager freeware product; the port is used only for OS updates.  The instrument is not compatible with Sound Manager.  As you correctly noted, the C2 and C2D instruments ARE compatible with that freeware, making reorganizing (no pun intended) a simple matter of dragging and dropping with a computer mouse.  Also, those instruments have front panel displays whichi will reveal actual progrm names instead of just numbers.  However, they predate the ""Extended Features"" set, which includes the creation of program lists from computer.  These features have not yet been back-engineered into those models.  Given the amount of time which has passed, I think it is unlikely that new OS' will be created for C2/C2D to integrate these features, but one never knows...Pablo""I was just hoping that if the same NORD engineers who developed on the C1 presets also worked on the C2, that the two preset lists might be close, so I could have a reference list to stick on my music stand, for when I am exploring the C1 sounds.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=48497&sid=284c4a3563e011cd562755e91a59e688#p48497

There were developed years apart.  And these original factory program banks are not to be thought of as divine tablets of wisdom brought down from the mountaintop.  Original factory programs are mainly intended to be (this is my opinion, not some official statement of Nord policy) are examples of what is possible with the instrument.  Musicians should not feel constrained to playing only factory programs on the instrument and indeed are enthusiastically encouraged to tailor sound to suit their personal musical needs and desires.  Lastly, main program names will really be quite meaningless in the grand scheme of things.  I mean, okay, they may occasionally evoke particular sound images in one's brain which may (or may not) bear some resemblance to the actual sound produced, but for example naming a program ""Jimmy Smith"" is somewhat generic.

Yes, this is the wrong conversation for this question.  It might have been best to simply start a new thread.But since we're here...the C2D ships from the factory with the Tonewheel Mode parameter set to extreme vintage.  Tonewheel organs, like people, can tend to become noisier with age -- ""rumbling in the basement,"" so to speak.  The Nord gives this sound with this setting.  The Tonewheel Mode setting is made on page 1 of the Sound Menu.

Like Mr. G, I, too, would simply love to have Pierre's chops in my arsenal.  Okay, so Pierre did hog the lead a bit, but it's not hard to imagine that, consiously or subscounsiously, Pierre might have felt that he had to play more in order to prove that he belonged in the jam sessionin the first place.  Joey not trying to prove anything -- he just played it cool and sat back.  There was at least once where Joey began to step in, saw that Pierre wasn't ready to step out, and Joey ducked right back out again to let Pierre continue.Used to be in my tagline, borrowed from The Fireman, Capleton: ""music is a mission, not a competition.""  Joey obviously understands that; he accepted and even enjoyed Pierre's playing.

Valhalla (http://www.valhallawoodworking.com) is well-known for making replacement wood parts and reproductions of vintage Hammonds and Leslies.Byron was enthusiastic about making me one and maybe offering it as a product for other C2D owners so I approached American Music and Sound (Nord's distributors in the US) and, while Nord do not want to put their name on a third-party product, they were happy to help by shipping a loaner C2D to Valhalla in Pennsylvania for measurement. AM&S feel it will help sales if there is a product like this available as some potential church customers are keen on the traditional organ vibe.Anyway, the loaner C2D from AM&S is currently en-route to Byron at Valhalla and it will take him about 6 weeks to design and complete the stand. I'm hoping that the price might come down if I can get a few buyers on-board with this initial production run. Off the top of his head, Byron said the stand will be $500 or more. He'll have an exact price over the next few weeks as he finishes the final design.If you are interested in getting one of these C2D stands, please contact Byron Coy at Valhalla Woodworking. His email isbyroncoy@msn.comorinfo@valhallawoodworking.comand his cellphone is (717) 368-3638.Thanks,-Brandon Christy.005.JPG (561.84 KiB) Viewed 5928 times",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=47045&sid=284c4a3563e011cd562755e91a59e688#p47045

It had OS 1.12 or something......until the other day, when I upgraded it to OS 2.00.I used the C2 as a controller a lot; specifically, i use it to drive an Alesis Nanobass to supplement the C2's bass section, often IN ADDITION to the organ bass.However, i noticed a bug where if I use the sustain pedal while playing the bass section, the bass notes get stuck. Notes played on the regular manuals behave correctly.Yes I messed with the sustain pedal polarity and the system settings, and they don't help the matter.Assuming there's no fix to this, I'd just as much rather downgrade to OS 1.30 like my other C2 has, or whatever is closest (I saw a fellow mentioning 1.32 in another thread).Any thoughts, advice, is much appreciated.Thanks!-Patrick",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=48564&sid=284c4a3563e011cd562755e91a59e688#p48564

Non pedal players can just sit the organ dead-center.It breaks down into just a few pieces that are easily portable and only takes 5mins to put together. It will come in a choice of wooden veneers (see pics attached).If you are interested in getting one of these clonewheel stands, please contact Byron Coy at Valhalla Woodworking for pricing. His email isbyroncoy@msn.comorinfo@valhallawoodworking.comand his cellphone is (717) 368-3638.

Now that procedure is not regarded as good practice any more, the adapter kit provides a safe way to get power to the Leslie.If you're not comfortable making an adapter yourself, and competent to work with mains, then I think $300 is a good deal for getting the job done. I don't know of another supplier of this - there isn't that big a market for them. Despite there being about a million or so Hammond organs still existing (wild guess, but in the right order of magnitude) when you take away the ones that don't work, the ones that the owner already has a Leslie sorted out, the ones where the owner IS prepared to make his or her own adapter and the ones where either the organ or the Leslie has been modded so the standard adapter is no longer right, you don't have a lot left to go on. Then when this number is split down into the various types of Leslie and Hammond organ connectors that have been used over the years, that's quite a few models for a small total number of units.I built an adapter for my Sonorous rotary speaker to connect the 9-pin cable (like a Leslie 760) to the high level output on the Nord, the half-moon switch on the Nord and the mains. I couldn't conveniently source the 9-pin Amphenol connectors, so I cannibalised the cable that came with the speaker and now only have this break-out cable to connect the speaker to anything at all. I spent about $50 on components, and if I'd built the whole shebang from end to end, the components would have cost more than that. Add in some labour, overheads, distribution and profit, and you can see that there's not going to be much incentive for anybody to undercut Hammond's $300 price tag.I'd just buy the damn' thing and get playing ...",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=48302&sid=284c4a3563e011cd562755e91a59e688#p48302

All work well, and of course you can configure the Nord to work optimally with any of those pedals.If you get the pedalboard absolutely right for Hauptwerk, the Yamaha will solve your Nord swell issue and if you want to move it on later, I think you'd get a good chunk of your outlay back if it's in good nick.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=47732&sid=284c4a3563e011cd562755e91a59e688#p47732

The pedal is a standard crybaby wah that I normally use when I play guitar. So I plug a mono out from the C2D (leslie sim bypassed) into the wah and volume pedal, then into the Ventilator. This sounds great, and I think it'll fit nicely in the music that we play in the band. But my problem is that the wah can give pretty high volume spikes that the Ventilator is unable to handle so the signal will clip digitally and it sounds terrible. This happens when I have the wah all the way down (in the highest frequency setting). To overcome this problem I have to lower the main output pot of the C2D to about 9-10 o' clock. This means that the overall output volume of my signal chain is very low and this might be a problem in some situations.What are my options here? Should I add a compressor/limiter pedal to put after the wah in the signal chain, but before the Ventilator? Then I might be able to increase the volume as the spikes should be taken care of. Another solution may be to get a stereo preamp box to put after the Ventilator in the signal chain.Any ideas or suggestions?",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=46972&sid=284c4a3563e011cd562755e91a59e688#p46972

If you add a preamp after the Ventilator you might end up just transferring the spikes to the next input after the preamp, although you might get away with it as the Ventilator will probably reduce your high frequencies (presumably where the spikes are) enough to act as a sort of ""spike filter"".

OR you can plug a TRS halfmoon into it, you just change the program on the Nord, and it will also control the 3300.So whatever you got will work.(BTW, the video with Tony Monaco at Hammond showing the 3300 shows a two-button Leslie foot-switch with the 3300, this is a mistake)",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=46424&sid=284c4a3563e011cd562755e91a59e688#p46424

Especially the Baroque Pipe Organ is my personal favourite and it seems to be right ahead with the best available software Pipe Organ Programs with several gigabytes. I guess the Stereo Chorus- and the Rotary Effects as well as the other ones of the engine are strengthen this impression. My only concern is that there are no more samples like the baroque! Is there a possibility for updates and extra samples in this category?Technically I would be interested in the benefits of the DSP Engine itself. I only know the specifications of the Nord Lead A1 Keyboard form Nord and others of it's class. They have a 24 Bit and 96 KHZ Sound Engine. So is the same implemented in the C2D too, or is there a 32 Bit Float Processor? In addition to the digital thematic I'm wondering about the outputs. There are no digital S/PDIF connectors. I think that's curious in times of Digital Audio Workstations in almost every studios. With good D/A converters and good shielded audio cables there should be no need for worries, but nevertheless i wonder about the need of a D/A - A/D workflow chain, in fact of the digital internal samples of the C2D. So I mean it would be no big technical step to implementate a digital output at all. Am I right with my speculations so far?My other point of view is the internal Rom or NAND Sample Memory. For example the Nord Stage 2 Keyboard has at least 880 MB useable samples and so i think the overall memory size of the chips is about 1 GB size. So my question is: Is the C2B comparable at this point with the Nord Stage 2? How big are all the samples together?I'm really happy to review the C2D Organ and look forward with enthusiasm to get a owner of one fabrication in the coming time.I'm thanking all people for the effort of writing me answers.Best wishesJesco",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=46994&sid=284c4a3563e011cd562755e91a59e688#p46994

There is only this ONE type of pipe organ (of course you can save and load your individual registrations = programs).- The rotary (Leslie) effect, the speaker simulation and the overdrive can't be applied to the pipe organ (only reverb, EQ and delay can).- There are no information available about the size of the sample memory of the Nord organs (because that doesn't matter).The Nord organs are fantastic instruments to recreate the sounds of the good old tone-wheel Hammond organs (incl. the Leslie speaker effect) and the well-known transistor VOX and Farfisa organs. Btw, these sounds are no samples!The pipe organ of the Nord C2 and C2D (they are identical) is actually a very nice Baroque type and I also like it very much. But as I said: There is only this one.If you are looking for ""pipe organs"" you could look for other manufacturers / types of organs, e.g. here:http://www.thomann.de/de/sakralorgeln.html. Or you could use some software with an external keyboard.If you like the ""package"" of the Nord organs but you will use the pipe organ most I would prefer the Nord C2 without the drawbars. Here the registrations are switched by buttons/knobs. At the C2D you have to pull and draw the drawbars which is for this use (= toggling) a bit circuitous. And you can get a second-hand C2 now quite cheap...Good luck and have a nice weekend!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=46999&sid=284c4a3563e011cd562755e91a59e688#p46999

I'm sorry to tell you this, but you will never get a set of nearfield monitors (or a p/a system) that sounds anything like a decent set of headphones.

I have a set of AT M40's myself, but you won't get any amplified system to sound like them.The best thing to do, is to check out different sets of monitors AGAINST EACH OTHER, and choose the ones that sound best to YOU.  There is nothing wrong with The HS 8, but look at as many different monitors as possible, then let your ears make the decision.You were talking about QSC 10's earlier.  There is a huge difference between them and HS 8's.

My needs may be different from yours regarding the sound your looking for at home.  Getting an acceptable sound out of a digital piano at home can be a trick, and expensive. I do not know if the HS 8's would serve your purpose, having not had a set.  I use 2 good quality stereo speakers, with a subwoofer on the left hand side to approximate a real grand, using a sampled piano.  My AKG 240 headphones sound better, but I accept that. I would like a pair of Focal  studio monitors and sub, but cannot afford it. As far as the powered cabinet goes, my use is live, and I rarely set my stage rig up at home.   I also run in mono live. Part of the difficulty I find in getting a good piano sound is the fact that it's not really a piano, but an approximation.

But he was a little nuts, so when the day came for his debut, he decided to play naked!And so he did! He brought out the trio, he played, his LH bass was impeccable, he squabbled, he sputtered, he glissed, he put lots a grit in it and made it good and greazy, he played be-bop, he played the blues, he played ballads. He had a license to overdrive!But because he was the Emperor, nobody would notice he was stark naked, indeed, everybody pretended he had clothes on, beautiful robes.Finally, one young child, to whom that kind of hypocrisy was still years away, could stand it no longer!

The sub's a one-man carry for reasonable distances, and you can walk miles with a top in each hand. I much prefer this setup to a pair of 12"" or 15"" active speakers (which I do also have).That said, if rich is the sort of piano sound you want, the Rolands seem to be more that way, or at least were some years ago when I bought my RD150 (yes, that long ago!).

In this case, It's got a female 9-pin connector at the speaker end (we're talking Leslie 760 pin-outs) and at the other end a row of sockets - one to take the high-level output from the Nord, one to take the jack of the Nord Half-moon switch, and one to take the mains power into the Leslie (or Sonorous, in this case).All the wiring diagrams are online - Uncle Harvey's guide to Leslie pinouts - so it should be OK (if you get the right 11-pin configuration!). The high-level output on the Nord is designed to drive the Leslie amp directly.You should be able to buy an 11-pin cable fairly cheaply as it's a current bit of gear.

I came a across a youtube video here:At approximately 8:02 he describes how the last draw bar for the swell manual can be pulled however if percussion is on, the effect will not be occur.  However, once percussion is turned off the change in sound occurs immediately and this is a way to quickly change sounds.So, on my C2 the percussion button seems to have no effect on the last draw bar.  Are there other settings I should know about to make this effect work?Thanks,",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=43232&sid=7806bbf87ecb41dfb079dac029d3d567#p43232

I've considered doing the same thing.  I've just started a midi bass pedal project wherein, I picked up a set of used StudioLogic midi pedals (17), and an old set of Hammond pedals (25).  I don't like pedals that ""hinge"" in the front (spinet type), because I'm used to the full Hammond size (hinges in the back).  I'm cannibalizing the midi contacts from the Studiologics, and will build a rig that the H pedals will be able to trigger them.  Reason I explain all this -  you should be able to pick up a set of midi contacts (rubber tops) or even buy one at a time.  Take a standard PS-1 or similar type footswitch, replace the trigger with a ""B"" midi contact, and tap away.   I'm no tech, so you'll have to figure out a way to translate the contact, into a midi switch, then to the keyboard.     I met the owner of Trek II the other day.  I may contact him with a suggestion.  See how much he'd want to build one.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=37980&sid=7806bbf87ecb41dfb079dac029d3d567#p37980

I purposefully resisted the urge to upgrade to the C2d sound because i loved the overdrive sound of the C2. the overdrive of the C2d does not increase the gain as does the C2.  Most players upgrade to the C2d upgrade because it offers better click, a different percussion, more editable leslie mike placement , and it's FREE .  I bought the C2 2 and a half years ago because the distortion and chorus were exactly what i was looking for in all my earlier clones. I had no reason to upgrade. It was THERE !If you want to go ALL out, etiher get a real Leslie, or look into the Speakeasy AMA pre-amp to use with the leslie. the AMA allows you to get the Jon Lord ( smoke in the water)  overdrive sound.  You may also want to experiment with different drawbar settings besides 888000000 or 888800000 to get that sound.  One good one is 686100457, with or without C3, and overdrive set 2 oclock.

Have you something strange in mind?Thank you, Tacitus, for your reply. To answer your question: yes and no...NO - When I plug directly into the (1)47 amplifier, my C1cansound quite shrill/ grainy/ digital when playing with a lot of the higher drawbars out or when playing higher up the keyboard. Impedance mismatching can also make the sound thinny, hence my question. I would think Nord'd have designed this output with impedance matching in mind, so my guess would also be that it should not pose a problem electrically... A second thought would be about the stability of the high output signal, but with the load selector OPEN it only drives the screen of the phase splitter tube through the volume pot. I must say I've had this ""problem"" for many years and have become very careful with pulling the higher drawbars on the Nord due to this exact issue. I did learn to use the equalizer knobs to tame the highs a bit - but then I have to remember knob settings and, honestly, I don't like the ""effect sound"" of the onboard equalizer: besides removing or adding a few dB's here and there, I also hear some Q factoring going on.YES - I am toying with the idea of adding an extra tube to my (1)47 amplifier, as pre-volume gain stage or post-volume gain stage. It should function as a tube pre-amp, with *maybe* some selectable high frequency roll-off and/or adjustable gain. I am looking at some guitar tube pre-amp designs as well as rack tube pre-amps and mic tube pre-amps to modify. My objective is sound fatness without sacrificing dynamics or the valuable asset of being capable to tap into a bit of aggressiveness in the sound to cut through the mix when necessary.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=42869&sid=7806bbf87ecb41dfb079dac029d3d567#p42869

I want to keep the pedals intact and just add contacts to each pedal and house in a small custom wooden enclosure with a expression pedal (yamaha fc7) attached to the top of it.

It has a prewired cable that looks like you connect the magnets to the tips of the pedals (toe side of the pedals) and attach the reeds to the housing for the pedals at the front of the pedals. This creates a midi note signal when they come in range of each other and sends it to the encoder. That bundle can be found here and retails as a full set up for about $250 USD with shipping.http://www.midiboutique.com/products/pr ... d_id=12603The second option is another magnetic reed contact system bundle with a pcb board from a polish company called midi hardware. It has a reed magnet system that is attached onto a pcb with a ribbon cable integral.http://www.midi-hardware.com/index.php? ...

Does anyone know what the internal arrangement of the housing for the reeds/encoder should look like?

Here's what I just completed:   Started with a set of Hammond A100 pedals (25), and a used set of StudioLogic MIDI pedals  (17).  Unless you're playing some serious organ pedal stuff with both feet, and need all 25 pedals, 17 is waaaay plenty.   So what I did was, cannibalize the StudioLogic pedals which I bought for $200 used.  Removed the circuit board which included the rubber topped contacts, plus the ribbon connector to the MIDI socket and DC power plug.  Both were on the same mounting plate.  The  circuit board was also mounted on a metal frame which was mounted in the plastic StudioLogic housing.  The Hammond pedals have support pieces strategically placed between notes, including one right after note 17.I cut away and removed notes 18 - 25 from the Hammond pedals.  Also then cut the right side of the Hammond box (hinge compartment), shortend the box to now accommodate 17 pedals, and re attached the side.  Looks just like the original, only smaller (narrower) .Next, I built a ""box"" to house the contact circuit board and connector mounting plate (which had to be cut out of the St.Log. plastic housing.  One issue was;  The Hammond pedal ""fingers"" are 'fanned' at the end, while the MIDI contact board is straight and evenly spread across the 17 notes.  The two ""almost"" lined up so I simply bent the metal pieces attached to the ends of the wooden Hammond pedals - to exactly line up with each of the MIDI Contacts.   The metal brackets were also ""bendable"" to exactly tune in their height position so as to correctly affect note on/off performance.   I cut away most of the metal frame from the picture below.Next, I constructed mounting pieces for the metal frame/MIDI circuit board, in the exact position within the 'box' that attaches to the Hammond pedal frame piece.  The long screws the keep the Hammond pedals together as a unit, were replaced with long bolts the now connected them to the new 'box'.I used 3/4"" pine for the box top, front, and bottom.   I cut pieces of the heavy gauge plastic from the St.Log pedals to enclose the ends of the box.  Plug 'r in, fire it up, and voila - works like a charm, and feels like the real deal Hammond Pedal action.  ('because it is!)  .  A little walnut stain on the box and it's looks cool.  I also fashioned a heel rest from one of the left over maple pedals.  End result is a set of 17 Hammond pedals that look just like they fit a B3.Quite the involved project from a construction aspect, but very little electronics.  Just moved all that stuff from one ""thing"" to another.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=42154&sid=7806bbf87ecb41dfb079dac029d3d567#p42154

I decided to wire this matrix up the old school way with momentary switches, diodes, and a 5x5 matrix of data/select line. I wanted to learn how to solder and get my ""chops"" so this was a great opportunity to get a good amount of experience and do it on the cheap. I bought a midi cpu ($45) a bunch of cable that will last me 10 projects ($15), 30 momentary switches ($25) and a few other components. I just used the same chassis as I had with my hammond. Total costs come to about $100 USD and about 10 hours of work (for a newb) to get it put together. Much better than a set of hammond pedals. They are just like playing a vintage organ, same height, felt covering the switches, used the same wood, steel sheets, and the exact same holes of the original contacts were located in. Just enlarged them by 1/32"" with a drill.Super rewarding project so far. I learned how to solder, wire things in a matrix and I think that I have a really nice looking set of vintage pedals to bring with my nord stage2/hammond or my stage2/c2 rig when I gig out on organ heavy sets.Here's the flickr gallery that I made throughout the process thus farhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/122340773@N07/",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=42615&sid=7806bbf87ecb41dfb079dac029d3d567#p42615

Now admittedly my favourite organ music is of the baroque period, so I don't need the whole Willis/Cavaille-Coll shebang to play what I like best, but even so, I'm finding the C2D's organ acceptable for most types of repertoire. I did find that using the couplers more is a help in 19th century music, but once I'd got a reasonable sub and satellite speaker setup the enjoyment increased exponentially. I have decent headphones for quiet playing and that's pretty impressive, too.Like you, I'm getting older and weaker, so whereas I started off thinking I'd buy a Hammond XK3c setup, the higher price and the added bulk and weight eventually decided me on the Nord. I'm so glad I did, too, because although I intended to play lots of Hammond and fiddle about a bit with the pipe organ, in fact it's turned out exactly the opposite. And keeping the whole rig small has been a good move - everything I need fits easily into the boot and back seat of my small estate car and no individual component is too heavy to get in and out of the car.For me, then, having to add a computer to this setup won't give me any great improvement in playing pleasure or versatility for gigs. Of course, if you intend to have Hauptwerk purely so you can enjoy lots of different organs, that's another matter altogether.And making pedal out of piping - isn't that going to be a drain on your resources?

I don't plan to get involved in playing gigs, so the installation might be considered permanent in the respect that I intend to leave it hooked up and ready to play in an instant.  In fact that is one of the reasons that I haven't based it on a couple of standard controller keyboards hooked up to a lap top  ---  i.e. waiting for PC to boot up.I actually have 2 pedalboards;  one from the Allen and another from an old Baldwin model 5 that suffered a similar fate by my hand over 30 years ago.  The problem with using one of them is their sheer size & weight.The objective is reduced bulk & weight, but with high capabilities and realism, especially in the pipe organ section.  I tend to believe the Nord keyboard action would be smooth yet robust, having plunked around on a used Nord digital piano for awhile at a Guitar Center.  The only thing I  noticed was that the Nord keys were 'noisy', loose  as in an old piano with worn key bushings.  Whether there's a convenient adjustment for this on the Nord, I don't know.

When mine goes out of warranty I'll open her up and see if a strip of felt in the right place will help to quieten the beast down a bit.If it's a permanent install, I'm not sure why you're worrying about the weight of things. An AGO style pedal board would be best - I opted fro the Nord pedals because lots of baroque organs had straight pedalboards and we're not really into heel and toe territory with 18th-century organ music (and the fact that I'm having difficulty not falling off the bench when I play pedals is neither here nor there).I'd be tempted to go for a custom console with three manuals, or at least the Nord C2D plus a third manual, as you'll need that for the best Hauptwerk instruments. Are you planning to use the PC screen for the stops or use the drawbars or what? I'm not well versed in Hauptwerk but I think both those options should work.I guess we're looking at this from slightly different perspectives - I'm definitely using my Nord for gigging and it goes out in my car every week for rehearsals or gigs, so I need everything to be up to life on the road. I also tend to gig with my stage piano as well; the Nord is in fact part 2 of my keyboard strategy to give me all the major 'dinosaur' sounds - Piano, Rhodes, Harpsi, Hammond, Vox, pipe organ and so on in the smallest practicable setup. With the C2D and my Roland piano, I've got everything I need and it all goes in the car, including speakers, without using up the front passenger seat.Anyway, it took me over ten years to add the C2D to my Roland, so I guess a few months spent planning wouldn't be wasted!

137771,13,7806bbf87ecb41dfb079dac029d3d567,p18710,My Impressions - C2 versus C2D,3283,Nordstrom2,2012-06-24T18:59:48+00:00,False,,"This post compares the Nord C2 dual manual organ to the new C2D model.  I have no affiliation with Nord or any other music company – I’m just a player.  I’ve tried to be as objective as I can be, but I make no claim to being a definitive source of information – other different opinions are most welcome.I will provide details below (sorry for the long post), but let me give you my net up front.  These are both excellent instruments that are a delight to play.  They are very well made, and they recreate the original Hammond sound extremely well (I have a B3 sitting next to them so can compare).  Which one you prefer depends on how you play.There are a number of differences, but by far the big kahuna is the presence of the physical drawbars on the C2D versus the now-classic Nord lights on the C2.  It may surprise you, but in my opinion, this is not a case of one being better than the other.  If you are a player who likes to actively tweak the sound of the organ in real time by changing the registration while holding notes, then you will strongly prefer the new C2D.  But if you are like most players who punch up a preset and play, then you will prefer the C2.The main reason is that preset players will prefer the C2 over the C2D is that when you select a preset on the C2, the panel lights instantly change so you see exactly what registration is active, and you can even see it on a dark stage.  You can tweak it in real time using the in/out panel buttons, though it is not as quick or as controllable as physical drawbars.  The Ocean Beach aftermarket solution is a reasonable one for tweakers, but it still requires extra set-up.The most significant downside of the C2D (outside of the extra cost) is that when you select a preset on the C2D, all you get is a single LED light above any drawbar that is active, with no information on the registration for that drawbar.  Even the display (an advantage versus the three-digit readout on the C2) does not show what the registration is.  So for presets (some of which are excellent, on both units), you are fully informed on the C2, and largely flying blind on the C2D.   So which instrument you prefer is really a function of the kind of player you are and how much you use presets (you will prefer the C2) versus creating and tweaking your own registrations live (you will prefer the C2D).Let me dive into the details of the changes.  To make this long post easy to scan, I will organize it by topic, from the largest differences to the smallest, and give you my net immediately under each topic.DRAWBARSNet – It Depends on Your StyleThe physical drawbars on the C2D duplicate a real Hammond console – two full sets for each manual as well as two pedal drawbars.  No other portable organ on the market today, even those from Hammond, has the full set of 38 drawbars.  Kudos to Nord for being aggressive.One downside, especially relative to the Hammond SK2, is that the Nord C2D drawbars are sliders with fairly cheap molded plastic “ends” that the players uses to adjust them.   Hammond uses the same drawbars on the SK2 that it uses on its full consoles, and the quality and feel is much better.  That said, Nord made a reasonable compromise not to have the full physical drawbars on the C2D.  Duplicating the real deal much more closely would have made the C2D unit deeper (the Nord style drawbars have the same adjustment length as my B3, but there is no “bar” that has to be accounted for), more expensive (having 38 full drawbars is very expensive – even the Hammond SK2 only has one set of 9), and heavier.  I wish the cheap plastic ends were of better quality, but outside of that, the C2D drawbars are fine.  Some purists will not like them, but for the reasons noted above, I think Nord made a reasonable compromise.LEFT HAND DRAWBAR PRESET PANELNet – Advantage to the C2DThis is not the second most significant change, but since it is linked directly to the drawbars, I will cover it now.  Nord moved the preset panel from the top (on the C2) down to the keyboard level (on the C2D).  I like that location a lot.  Easier to change presets quickly, and easy to connect your preset choice to the manual.  In addition Nord added buttons to select either of the two physical drawbar sets connecte to the panel.  So changing from the Bb preset (black preset key on a real Hammond) to the B natural preset, is piece of cake.  Very handy.Nord also duplicated the drawbar selection buttons on the drawbar presets themselves, letting you select the preset there if you prefer.  In both cases, an LED light lets you know your selection.  When a drawbar panel is active, you get lights both next to the drawbars and on the preset panel to the left of the each manual.  Very well done.The only thing that drives me a bit nuts is that on the preset panel to the left of the manuals, the preset for the second set of drawbars (to the right) is actually above the preset for the first.  So top to bottom on the preset panel, you have Preset 1, Preset 2, Preset 3, Drawbars B and then Drawbars A.  The last two are just backwards versus how I personally think about them.  I’m sure I will adjust over time, but for now, I’m always selecting the wrong set because my logic is the order of the presents should be 1, 2, 3, and then A, B.  A minor issue, but one that takes some getting used to.DISPLAYNet – Advantage to the C2DThe C2 only has a three-digit numerical display, with the programming codes for the System, MIDI and Sound menus printed on the panel to the right of the control section.  It works (since you rarely use any of those commands in a performance and since the display is very bright and large so it is easy to see what number preset you are calling up on a dark stage).  But information is limited to three digits, so you have to remember that preset 39 is Whiter Shade of Pale, etc.The C2D has a 2x16 character display, similar to the other Nord keyboards.  For presets you not only see the number, but the name (which you can change).  And you also see the programming parameters on the display.  The display is a much better (albeit more expensive) option.The big downside is that the two-line display shows no information on the registrations or any other parameter in presets.  In the Stage 2, for example, you can hold the Shift key and then move any physical control, and the display will show you the programmed setting for that control.  I’m quite surprised that same functionality is not in the C2D, but it is not.  You are flying blind on presets, with very limited knowledge outside of your ears about what is programmed in that preset.The drawbars, the left drawbar preset panel and the display are the three major differences.  Everything else is minor, but let me cover the differences I have found so far.COLORNet – Which You Like Better Is a Personal ChoiceThe C2 uses the classic Nord red for the side panels and the metal panels.  The C2D what I would describe as dark red burgundy side panels, and all the metal parts (panels, etc) are black.When I first saw the bright red keyboards from Nord, I was completely turned off.  I prefered much “classier” looking colors – black with walnut side panels was great by me.  But over the years that red color has become part of the Nord trademark, and every musician I know now associates that red color with the very high quality products that Nord makes.  You can tape over the name on stage if you want, but musicians instantly know you are playing a Nord.The new C2D is very classy looking, and five years ago I would have strongly preferred it.  And in some venues – churches come to mind – it would definitely be preferred.  But since I also play a Stage 2, I’m actually fine with the C2, which matches the Stage 2.POWER CORD in the U. S.Net – Minor Advantage to C2D for U. S. consumersEven in the U. S., the Stage units and the C2 use the European style cords, which are a bit hard to find in the U. S., especially in longer lengths.  The C2D (at least the one I have here in the U. S.) uses a much more standard connector by U. S. norms.  That is a plus for U. S. customers.  I suspect Nord is still using the other connection in Europe, but do not know.KEYBOARD FEEL AND CONSTRUCTIONNet – I Do Not Perceive a Huge DifferenceI am told by reliable sources that Nord has added some additional strength to the frame of the C2, and has tweaked the keyboard to give it even more of a Hammond feel.  Playing both the C2 and the C2D keyboards, I do perceive a small difference – the C2D seems to have a hair more resistance to it – but the difference is really subtle to me.  I had two other people play both, and they perceived no difference at all.Both Nords feel quite different from the real Hammond organs in the studio, and there are even some significant differences between the Hammonds.  My net is that while I understand there are some differences in construction and keyboard feel between the C2 and C2D, I don’t really notice anything material.  Frankly, they are both excellent, and they both play better than the keyboards on the real Hammonds (though those are 40-50 years old).DIMENSIONSNet – Not the Same, but Not Materially DifferentThe specks of the C2 and C2D show that they are have the exact same dimensions:  966 mm (38.0""), 163 mm (6.4""), 445 mm (17.5"").Measuring the two units in front of me, they are close but not the same.  The keyboards are identical, of course.  But the dimensions I measure (in inches are):Length:  both units are 38.0” longDepth:  The C2 is 17 1/8 inches but the C2D is 17 3/8 inches (which is the number quoted in the spec)Height:  The Nord C2 is 5 5/8 inches, the C2D is 5 7/8 inchesThey both fit fine in the padded case that Nord sells to protect the instrument, but if you had a custom road case built for the C2, it is conceivable that the ¼ inch differences on two of the dimensions may affect your fit.DELAY FEEDBACK LEVEL DISPLAYNet – No Big Deal Either WayOne difference I noticed but have yet to explore is that the C2D has three levels of delay feedback displayed (two lights and then having both lit), versus two on the C2.  I do not know if this is simply a difference in the display or if there are differences in the feedback programming.  My guess is that once C2 users upgrade to the new OS, any differences in the program are ported to the C2, and the difference is only in the granularity of the display information.SPEAKER MODEL DISPLAY LIGHTSNet – No Big Deal Either WayThis also just seems to be a difference in the display.  But the C2 used the two-light method to show the three different speaker models (Rotary, JC and Twin – both lights lit). The C2D has three separate lights, paralleling the Organ Model panel that is next to it.  I like the parallel structure, but it’s a nit in the scheme of things.That’s all I know so far.  If there is a difference in sound between the two units, my aging ears have not yet picked it up.Sorry for the long post, but this is a big purchase so I wanted to share what I’ve learned to benefit others who are considering the same choice.Your millage and opinions may differ.  If they do, please add the dialog.  The choice between the C2 and the C2D is, in my opinion, a choice between two excellent products, where the “winner” depends on your needs and your style of playing.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=18710&sid=7806bbf87ecb41dfb079dac029d3d567#p18710

I'm torn between the led display of the C2 and the drawbars of the C2d.  I also have the Hammond SK-2 and it's drawbars work the same way the Nord C2d does.  On the Hammond the current drawbar setting is displayed on it's LCD display.  I think Nord really had a better idea when they introduced the C1 and C2 with the led drawbar settings.  The C2d drawbars are somewhat cumbersome when setting up the pipe organ patches and the Vox and Farfisa organs as well.  Thankfully both models allow saving your settings to presets.I've dealt with the same knob/slider update issue with the Yamaha Mofif line for years as well.

I wish Nord had decided, even if they wanted to offer the two-set-per-keyboard, to simply replace the two buttons with a single rocker or paddle (push away for less, pull for more, just like a drawbar)  This would have retained the advantages of the LED-drawbutton system, and eliminated its only bad feature, the un-ergonomic, not-very-intuitive (in my opinion) two buttons. They could even make the rocker or paddle look like a draw bar end.

Yup, for just a few bucks more, once it's all discounted, you get all five sets of drawbars, which before the C2D could only be gotten on a vintage tonewheel or Hammond Suzuki top-line products.  One would think Nord should charge at least $1000 more for that kind of exclusivity!

It helped me a lot in the short time I've been using it. I recently got a C2D to fulfill my lifelong desire to own a B3. I felt it was a better solution than contending with the mechanical complexities of the original.By way of background, I am not a musician, neither by training nor talent, but I have a lot of fun playing with my C2D and had a keyboard years ago which I used with a sequencer, to my great joy, and everyone else's great consternation. Now that I have more time to dedicate to keyboard, I hope it's never too late to learn enough that I get requests other than ""Use your headphones.""So I am here seeking your suggestions for an amp / speaker combination or active speakerwhich I can use as a monitor for the C2D in my home.I would not ever carry it to gigs, so compact size is not pre-requisite. It will stay put once it is positioned in my 55ft L x  32ft W x 25ft H open space Living Room / Dinning Room. All the surfaces of the room are ""hard"" and the ""ceiling"" is a barrel roof, so the space is very ""live"", with extended echo times. Generally, I have a preference for ""bullet proof"" products and have little patience for things which require maintenance. I have a pretty well developed ear, having been an audiophile for over 50 years. I like deep, defined bass but hate ""boom"". I prefer smooth, precise treble to the peaky treble exhibited by some speakers in an effort to achieve a sense of ""clarity"". Unlike many audiophiles I have no objection to well executed DSP.Thank you for sharing your knowledge and experience.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=41232&sid=7806bbf87ecb41dfb079dac029d3d567#p41232

I use EV SXa250's with my KeyB Duo Mk111 in a 25x30 studio/rehearsal room in my home and they sound very good.  They have been replaced now by EV but I don't recall the model number of their replacement.  Some prefer smaller (8 or 10 in.) powered monitors used in conjunction with a subwoofer, but that's a matter of space, complexity of hookup, and personal preference.  Certainly a high quality sub would give you a more defined bass than a full-range 12 or even a 15.  Of course there is also the financial component which may or may not be a factor.In any case, enjoy your C2D.

I've owned a Hammond M3, Hammond XK1, and XK3C.  The M3 was connected to a Leslie 760, and the XK's went to a Leslie 860.  I first bought the XK1, within a month, I had returned it to upgrade to the XK3C due to the ability to expand with a lower manual.  The XK3C was great, loved the drawbars and and overdrive among other features.  Didn't care so much for the leslie sim, but I just turned that off and ran it throught my 860.  When the XK3C was stolen, I was left with some major choices.  There was serious allure with the Nord C2, the obvious 2nd manual, built in transistor organs and a Hammond tone that put the XK3C to shame.  The built in Leslie sim is REALLY good!  I went on tour without the Leslie and ran the C2 into a Fender Deluxe Reverb, loved it.   The Nord seemed to ""Breath"" and felt more alive and responsive that anything else (other than the real thing).  And the weight!  It seemed as though I simply got way more bang for my buck.  For local shows and future tours, I connect the Nord via 11 pin cable to the Leslie 860 and connect the mono output to the Fender Deluxe Reverb and blend the two.  The Deluxe brings out a bunch of the mids and highs and compliments the Leslie very well.  I play in a rock band with a great bass player, so I have little need for booming bass out the organ.If you're on the fence about either of these boards, go with the Nord, you will NOT be disappointed.  I can honestly say that if it were stolen or damaged, I would buy another.  The only down-sides I saw were the lack of drawbars ( you get over it and move on pretty quick) and the bright red colour.  So I took mine apart and sanded down the pieces, masked off the controls and outputs and painted it black.  I varathaned the whole thing once the paint dried.  It looks deadly!  After a few more tours, and a few more scratches, I'm going to have a custom wood shop make some nice end blocks and veneer the metal top and back panels.

The fact that you run the tonewheel model on your C2 through a fender deluxe says a lot about your lack of credibility to make statements such as ""the Nord C2 puts the hammond xk-3c to shame...."" I suspect you have limited experience with an actual B3/C3/A100, so careful about what you post. If you ever do come across an actual B-3/C-3/A-100 play it straight out of the preamp and compare that tone with the tone of your ""dry"" (i.e. no amp sim) nord. Then, compare the dry xk-3c tone with the pre-leslie B-3/C-3/A-100. I'l just leave it at that... but in case you don't get a chance to AB the two, take it from me, the Nord's dry tonewheel is very, very different from a real B3/C3/A-100, wheras the hammond xk-3c is almost identical. Again, it's great that you've connected with the Nord C2. Nord has done much to add to the continuation of the organ in the grand spectrum, that being said, neither the C2, nor the C1, nor the organ models in the stage or electros are authentically hammondlike. They are authentically nord-like. I'm sure many years from now, as more and more kids forget what a real tonewheel organ looks and sounds like the Nord will become an instrument in it's own right just as the fender rhodes did trying to emulate a real piano. However, if you want the authentic experience of playing B3, playing an xk-3c will get you there more than playing a nord will, both in terms of tone, and in terms of interface. You have to understand that Nord deliberately markets their instruments at a certain type of musician: i.e. one who wants to carry as little as possible and get the best tone right out of the boxwith minimum effort required. Professionals usually have a crew, and usually spend hours, upon hours calibrating their instruments to achieve the sound they need. Compare the editing capabilities of the nord to the editing capabilities of the xk-3c and you kinda begin to understand that Nord is targetting a different demographic, one which you obviously fit into. Sorry if I'm ranting here, but I have a real passion for the B3, and it bugs me to no end when I keep running into kids with no real hammond experience telling people that the Nord C2 has a better hammond tone than an xk-3c. Sorry, but that is just plain false. These same kids would probably pick their Nord over an actual B3 in a blind test, and that's cool! Say you play a Nord, and be proud of it's original sound, but don't start making opinions about how ""hammondlike"" your Nord sounds if you don't have significant experience playing a B3/C3/A100 through a 122. A nord C2 sounds awesome, but it is not what a hammond sounds like...accept that you play a really cool sounding organ, but be careful about your comparisons. If you still don't ""get"" what I'm ranting about, try playing your C2 through and actual 122, and an xk-3c through an actual 122, and you will begin to understand why the dry C2 tone sounds different than a dry xk-3c tone.  The raw tone of a nord is 'colored' to work better with their internal leslie sim. Nord made the intelligent assumption that their target market would not be bonnafide organ players. As such, they went with a less hammondlike tone that would sound better with their simulator knowing that the majority of their users would not be crating an actual 122. Hammond, on the other hand, went with a more authentic hammond tone that would sound more authentic through an actual 122 and slightly less through it's internal simulator.  I wouldn't be suprised if the new sk models sound better through their internal simulators and worse through a real 122. Again, the SK is competing with the Nord C2 in terms of the kinda of user who would be into such an instrument, and guessing by the inclusion of real drawbars and some killer non-hammond tones, I think Hammond Suzuki will be taking a pretty big bite out the C2's market. Oh, here is an example of an xk-3c through a 122. Guess I'm just an old kook, but for a digital clone, this sounds pretty real to my ears",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=9374&sid=7806bbf87ecb41dfb079dac029d3d567#p9374

A bit sensitive...I ran my Xk3-c through PA's and and recorded it direct as well as through Leslies (860 / 145 / 760).  I loved that board, don't get me wrong.  As far as it interface and set up goes, I spent roughly the same amount of time setting up presets in the XK as the C2.  So they both just plugged in and played.  You're right about my B3 flight time, none.  I've recorded on a A100, and owned a '55 M3.  So 'kinda' close.  But the thing is with these organs, including the C2, is it depends on what kind of music you play.  I play psych rock.  So a crunchier, overdriven bite is what I'm into most of the time.  Not all the time, but most of the time.  And that's why I BLEND the Fender Deluxe tone with my Leslie 860.I don't know.  I don't want you to jump all over me, but I'm not promoting ""misinformation"" here.  THIS IS PURELY OPINION.  A matter of taste.  I loved that you kept calling me a ""kid'...  It's funny, because I turn 29 today.  And frankly, I don't see how how that has anything to do with anything.  Here's another fact to scathe me about.  My stage rig includes modern, digital and analog versions of classic keyboards, I'm not touring with a B3, Mellotron, Rhodes and Minimoog, and all required amps and Leslies.  But to the ears of the people in the bars and venues, they can't tell.  And I've put together a rig that is still practical and portable.  That's a big factor for me.Gotta love purists!  I tip my hat to you for standing by what you believe in.  This was just a comparison between clonewheels.

You just kinda jarred me with the statement, ""with hammond tones that put the xk-3c to shame...""  I was convinced that the Nord sounded more like a B3 until I started researching pre-leslie signals, and the way that each of the respective clones interact with the poweramp in a 122 vs the internal modelling of the 122.

One of the first things I did for my C1/C2 was to build a drawbarsetup. If I build one more it will be a 4 set one. You can plan ahead with 2 sets per manual.One area where all clones , and the new B3, miss out is the keyboard feel.Old hammonds (pre 74) have a key with a pivot point well inside the manual. This means the wight needed to press they is only a factor ~2 when you play the key as far in as you can. On modern keybeds with the pivot point 1 or 2 cm from the inner key end the increase in force is much larger. I've tested the new B3 and for the money the beyboard is as sloppy as on my XB3. (only played the xk3 once so i have no opinion)The Nord keyboard feels a lot tighter. But it also has the pivot point issue.I wonder if any clone has an old style keyboard with a very long key same as the B3.From my point of view the C2 gives me all the gospel sound i need in a package that is easy to haul. With my homebrew drawbars i quickly get the sounds I want. I use a leslie 145. Pedals are an midified a100 pedalboard.A B3 has other qualities that clones miss out on. The touch responsiveness. That is that the invidual contacts engage at slightly different position as you press the key.The way a B3 changes sound when you play percussive slaps etc.Have you tested if an xk3 adresses those things correctly?If you want 100% B3 sound there is, in my opinion, only one way to go. The heavy one.As for clones - get the one you like to play and that you feel gives you what you want. Then focus on the music.As far as C2 goes - I habe never wished for a B3 when I play it - it delivers enough of what i want (of course I want more within what I know is possible for digital emulatio)/FrederickRegards Frederick",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=11029&sid=7806bbf87ecb41dfb079dac029d3d567#p11029

So I had to bring my NS2 to both places. My NS2 with my hard case is about 65-70 pounds.After 6 weeks, I decided to use my S90ES and XK3c with one band and the NS2 with the second one because of my back (hurts too much in the stairs).When I used my XK3c last practice, I realized how much the NS2 was better. I was happy not to have sold my Neo Ventilator.With the Ventilator, my XK3c sounds very good. I did not feel the need to use my Vent with my NS2.It's hard to say why I prefer the NS2. When I bought the XK3c, I was very happy, It was better that my Motif ES6 or Korg M3.After 9 months, I decided to buy the Ventilator because I no longer like the XK3c rotary simulation.The sound of my XK3c was better, more real, more vintage with the Vent... The ventilator is a very good rotary emulation.Like I said, I never felt the need to use the vent with my NS2 because the organ sound very realistic to my ears, it sounds pure, vintage.And I know that after my NS2 will be paid off, I will buy the latest keyboard from Nord. I do not know if it will be the Nord Stage,the Electro or the Nord Organ, but I know that I will have the latest Nord organ emulation.I should have went to a musical store to try both before I bought my XK3c.

A sizeable core of old Hammond players prefer the xk3c because of the UI, & the 'raw' sound, But there are also a great amount of Hammond veterans who prefer the Nord sound. The xk3c users seem to not mind hours, days & weeks of tweaking the editing features of the Hammond clone to get their own 'special' sound.; nor do they mind hassling with a leslie on gigs which requires a lot of experience in getting it properly miked (otherwise, you're better off just using a leslie sim , like a Ventilator or a Dynachord for instance. Both accurately reproduce a properly miked leslie.) Many of the Hammond users run the thing thru a leslie, which DOES sound better than the native xk3c sim.The Nord sound, on the other hand, already sounds good out of the box to a lot of us. for me, it sounds actually better than many of the different Hammonds i played back in the 60's,70's & 80's. Other clones, like the Mojo, Diversi, & Key B have at least caught up with it, at least to some ears, but none of these represent the total Organ package as well(b3,Pipe,farsfisa & vox) with the possible exception of the SK2 > I much prefer the Nord sound. The drawbuttons are quite easy to adapt to, & the programing is EASY. It does equally well in a Jazz setting, as it does in Rock, Funk, Pop, etc. The Pipe organ is TERRIFYING !The hammond clone was designed with innumerable options for the die-hard Hammond fanatic,while the Nord was designed for convenience, portability, & ease of use. to MY ears, it's leslie simulation, overdrive, chourus/vibrato MORE than fit the bill.

That's ONE way. Learn that one, it's good for the walking line.

You need to be able carry that line on.  take slow tempos, swing maybe, & practise tapping root & fifth, in 2/2 or 4/4, either repeating root - fifth, root - fifth, or stepwise. Latin stuff ? practise root & fifth , with a syncopated feel.  learn to carry the line one bar with the foot , then the left hand carrying the line ( lots of pa-chant grace notes) & the pedal in the one-note percussive style. practise it until it's almost SEAMLESS.

I did wonder at the wisdom of using a parallel board to play classical, but in fact having looked at more baroque instruments and other smaller, older, classical organs it seems to be quite common, so I'll have a good go at it.I've got Beauty in the B somewhere, so I'll have a look at that, too. It's all getting quite exciting. I think this will be the first time I've bought a complete 'set of parts' in one go instead of doing it bit by bit and failing to get everything because some of it goes out of production before I can afford it all. At the end of play, I'll have the C2D, soft case, ALU stand, music rest, half-moon switch, pedals and case for pedals.

And in today's money the Yamaha would be getting on for £12,000 as opposed to £2,500 for the C2D. And if there's a shoot-out, I can hide behind the Yamaha, too (there's a story about that happening with a Hammond, but I can't recall the details).But getting back to the ALU stand, I may strap it to the outside of the organ case for some gigs - if it's going in the back of the car that'd be OK.

Once I've assembled all the components into a working configuration, I'm left with a rat's nest of cables that, try as I might, I don't seem to be able to get tidy.Then the germ of an idea takes hold and I'm now thinking that with the right hardware I could run the swell pedal cable and the midi cable from the pedals up one of the legs of the ALU stand and thus hide them from view, and run the outgoing signals from the C2D itself down another leg so the subsequent cable(s) could run flat across the floor (and, to keep Mrs tacitus happy, under a mat to stop tripping). I could also loom up the mains and signal cables from the sub to the satellites and not only have a neater job but having it pre-wired would slash set-up time, too.By now, you're thinking it's all a bit anal and how would you connect the pedals to the 'upward leg' of the stand? And that's where I've ground to a halt as it would need a small enough multipin connector to mount flush inside the leg so it folds up as normal when collapsed. Not saying it can't be done, but I haven't worked through that one yet.I'm also wondering if there's a suitable DC voltage in the C2D to power the pedals so I could dump the wall-wart.Apologies for giving you half a story, but anybody have any ideas about the next step here?

It does depend on how far you are willing to go though: theoretically you could mount a 2nd power supply (for the PK27) inside the C2D, as there should be plenty of space. Unless you know what you're doing that would be a bad idea (and would surely void your warranty). You'd also need to make sure the power going to the 2nd PSU would NOT go through the fuse in the Nord (might lead to blowing fuses). Instead, you'd solder the 2nd PSU to the points where the mains voltage enters the Nord. Make sure to include a properly sized fuse.This is the PSU of my Nord Rack 3, but the one in the C2D should be fairly similar.You could solder the connections to the PSU to the underside of the PSU board, where the IEC mains connector is soldered to the board. The IEC connector is the black connector near the blue transformer. The black 'tube' on the right contains the fuse. By picking one point on that connector and another on the switch, you might be able to put the 2nd PSU 'behind' the power switch. That would require some measurements with a multimeter to find the right points though.As for the multi-pin connector you mention: how many contacts would you need? I think there are, for example, 7 pin XLR connectors. Something like a DB9 or DB25 style connector would likely also work well.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=37860&sid=7806bbf87ecb41dfb079dac029d3d567#p37860

Anything with powdered sugar?  I think Mooser is perhaps suffering from recent holiday cookie deprivation (or overload?) and trying to hunt down some more cookies to satisfy his cravings.Unlike most all of Nord's keyboards, on the C-series organs the wooden end cheeks can be removed by removing all of the visible screws on them.  I don't think there's any particular reason to prefer to remove one side vs. the other; I'd remove both and have an inspection and to shake out anything loose in there.Then again, you're not talking about a toy piano or a kazoo here.  If there is any significant amount of debris in there, then complete disassembly really is called for, as distasteful (no pun intended?) that may seem.  By the very nature of the design, anything which falls in between the keys is going to land on the keybed contacts beneath those interkey gaps and effectively provide a reservoir of foreign matter simply waiting to be sucked into any given note's key contact surfaces.  Keep in mind that every time you release a note, air is pulled into the contact chamber.  And you'll be better off scheduling a repair in advance on your time frame rather than putting it off until the inevitable day when you really really need to rely on your instrument for that important gig and then have Murphy's Law bite you in the backside.Bless,Pablo",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=38640&sid=7806bbf87ecb41dfb079dac029d3d567#p38640

Some Nord owners may have considerable keyboard repair skills and others may not.  In the interest of being ""on the safe side"" these kinds of responses are slanted towards those who do not.  Personally, I might be willing to risk assisting someone over the phone with those kinds of repairs on older, simpler and less valuable instruments, but due to the complexity of the C-series build and the dollar value of a C2D, I would not be comfortable with that in this kind of situation.  Someone else may feel differently.  There are many things that can go wrong, and being on the other end of the phone line while someone inadvertantly damages their very expensive instrument is not a happy feeling.All Nords use Fatar keybeds, which are quite generic to the world of keyboards at large.  Any reasonably competent keyboard tech should be able to handle that job.  Thus, most people who are located in or near any large metro areas in the USA are likely to have someone reasonably close and be able to avoid packing and shipping.Pablo",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=38692&sid=7806bbf87ecb41dfb079dac029d3d567#p38692

I honestly don't think its' a good idea, though. I use a pair of 8"" actives with a 12"" active sub for my C2D, and I find that's a pretty good compromise between extreme bass response and portability.

When you move the switch to slow or fast the force on the switchtip is away from the switchconsole, especially when you have to be reflex-quick during lefthand bassplaying. Switching the halfmoon happens in a blink of an eye, so I suppose the force on the tip is relatively large to push the solid internals of the switch into a new position. I had to glue it to keep on the switch.Some time later it ended up in two parts. Perhaps the force of the metal part of the switch cuts the plastic or cuts through a melting-area of the two tipparts (maybe this should be right-angled on the force-direction).The metal piece inside the switchtip has sharp corners, it is not comfortable, and your fingers/handpalm will be scratched and bleeding after a session or concert (what is a great stage-act by the way).Halfmoon with broken tipHalf Moon 1.jpg (38.21 KiB) Viewed 1774 timesAnyway, because I had to redneck my way out fast (these things happen when stores are closed, Murphy's law, you know the drill), I found some piece of tubelike shell, perhaps something like isolation-material. I glued it on the metal part of the switch again, using some two-component superglue. Make sure that there is no glue running underhand out of the tip into the switchconsole. Otherwise it is stuck to one position. If it does not hold, it could help to drill a few small holes into the metal tipholder first and let the glue fill it that so after harding the glue (and tip) will be intertwined with the metal tipholder.Half Moon New TipHalf Moon 2.jpg (25.75 KiB) Viewed 1774 timesLooks good! More important, a side-effect is that because the size of the switch-knob is a bit bigger it is easier to get it during basslineplaying with the left hand, although the original shape made it easer to leave the switch if it was not in the middle.

So here's the word on that : Keyclick differs a lot between the hammies, so it comes down to personal preference and the style of music you play. Percussion : to choose the right volume is influenced by speaker setup, pre-amp, room acoustics and EQ.

You could stick some bitumen mats to the bottom of the case (on the inside), but those are a bit smelly (it is pretty much a form of tar).What would probably also work is putting like some folded up bed sheets (clean, preferably) on a flat surface and sit your C1 on that, so it does not rest on its rubber feet. Because of the large surface it sits on, the amount of noise transmitted should be quite a bit lower.

Or will it reset to 1.12?4) In case answer 3 in ""NO"", Is there a way to downgrade the firmware to 1.0?Any suggestion is welcome …thank you in advanceEnrico Dell'Aquila",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=37491&sid=7806bbf87ecb41dfb079dac029d3d567#p37491

I'm not sure if this is the case or not, but perhaps the factory presets need to be updated. Perhaps they slightly changed the way they are stored, etc. I would suggest making a backup of the current sounds and then sending a fresh copy of the factory defaults to the C1 again to overwrite them. If you made a backup, you can always restore that.To make a backup or to send the factory sounds to the C1, you need a computer with a MIDI interface. The procedure is briefly described on page 19 of the C1 manual.Here it is in a bit more detail:Make sure the MIDI interface is connected to your computer and is working. Connect the C1 with the MIDI interface; MIDI OUT on the C1 connects to MIDI IN on the interface and MIDI OUT on the interface connects to MIDI IN on the C1.Install a utility to send/receive MIDI SysEx data. For Windows I would suggest Bome's Send SX (http://www.bome.com/products/sendsx) and for the Mac SysEx Librarian (http://www.snoize.com/SysExLibrarian/) - both are free, but there might be limitations on commercial use for Send SX.Start the SysEx utility and set it up to receive a backup from the C1 - check the documentation for the utility you're using to see how to do that. In SysEx Librarian on the Mac, I think you just click the 'Record Many' button in the top-right of the window.Go into the System menu of the C1 (page 15-16 of the manual) and select Dump All. This sends a SysEx dump with all the current programs to the SysEx utility.Now check and make sure Memory Protect is turned off on the C1 (see page 15 of the manual).Make sure you have downloaded (from the Downloads section for the C1 on the Nord website) the zip file with the factory sounds - it is only a very small file. Extract this file somewhere you can find it. It will contain a single file with a .syx extension.Load the .syx file with the factory sounds into the SysEx utility and send it to the C1. According to the manual (page 19) the display of the C1 will display 'rCu' while it is receiving the data - wait for the utility to finish sending the SysEx dump.Now check the presets again for sound quality. If you want to restore the old sounds (backup), performs steps 5 thru 7 again but use the backup you made earlier.As for your specific questions:No idea, I don't have a C1While I can imagine presets sounding different (I've had this on a different Nord), I would expect the sound quality to be the same or better after an update. This is also why I suggest updating the factory sounds.It wouldn't have any effect, it would stay at 1.12.If you can find the older firmware (I looked briefly, but wasn't able to find it) you can probably down-grade to an older version. Not an ideal solution though, since it seems 1.12 contains quite a number of important fixes according to the update history.If updating the factory sounds has no effect (or you cannot find or borrow a MIDI interface) I suggest contacting Clavia about this via the support section on their website. You can also contact the distributor for your region (click on the Distributors link at the top of the Clavia/Nord website) - the advantage of this is that it might be easier to communicate with them, since you can just do it in Italian.I would appreciate it if you can post a short update for this issue once you have more info or, hopefully, have it solved; this might be helpful for some other C1 owner who runs into this issue in the future.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=37501&sid=7806bbf87ecb41dfb079dac029d3d567#p37501

Comparing with VB3/Crumar Mojo (I have the software only), I feel the sub bass much more present in the plugin. I tried some ways to fix that with onboard EQ, unsuccefful. Is there any way to improve the Nord at this point? Maybe an item to enhance in a future update?

In my case, it was between the C2D and the Hammond XK3C, but in the end I figured that both had enthusiasts and detractors, with regard to both the B3 emulation and the Leslie emulation, so I decided in the end that as I wanted the baroque organ and the whole thing would be cheaper, I'd go for the C2D. In a band, or even playing solo, the differences are much smaller than the breadth of a man's talent, and if you can play the thing, that's fine. If you can't, well ... .Also, I discovered that physically moving air with a real rotary is the best, even if it's not tubes and even if it's not an actual Leslie. But the moving air thing might be lost if you mike up a Leslie in a band, so you need the 3300 to have a bit more volume and even then it might not be enough for a loud rock band.99% of punters will not know or care: the other 1% would most likely be fooled if you put your sim through the PA and stood a dummy Leslie at the back of the stage somewhere!

I can't plug a unbalanced signal (via a 1/4 instrument cable) into a balanced one can I?Any info would be great!Thanks,-Ryan",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=36103&sid=8859738f9515a540e6dd0e89a35cd3ab#p36103

They're a couple of dollars and have a 1/4"" plug with an RCA socket built on the end.If you can solder, even better to make up a lead with 1/4"" plugs one end and RCA the other, but the solution above is fine for most purposes - I just wouldn't gig with a load of adapters like that, though lots of people do.You can go from unbalanced to balanced, but it depends on the way your balanced inputs are engineered on how much volume you lose.

Of all the bits, I'm least happy with the music rest, because it's quite a way off from me. Not a bad distance for my varifocals, but still trying for small print.

Is it passable to use it through the PA? I have access to a real leslie but we can't transport it with any of our cars so we'd have to rent one or something. I understand that this is highly subjective, but is the leslie sim good enough in a live context or should I try to convince my band mates that we need to bring the leslie?Secondly, if we don't bring the leslie, should I bring some kind of monitor amp to hear myself better? We will be playing at pretty small venues, but still, perhaps hearing myself will be difficult when the PA speakers are directed at the audience?

Playing thru a QSC K12 powered speaker.  Plenty of volume, tons of bass, and great dynamic range.  I'm lovin' me some NORD!    (BTW - you may or may not agree with the basis of my comments - sound and like/dislikes are purely in the ear of the beholder, right?OK, here's the deal with the bass pedal sounds.   A standard B or A model Hammond typically has some high frequency tones in both 16' & 8' bass drawbars that I personally find awful.  I've been playing left hand bass as well as pedals forever, and want a very similar sound from both.  (LHB drawbar setting I like is 828000000) .  A long time ago, I learned of a very cool but beautifully simple wiring trick to eliminate the high freq's in both pedal drawbars.  Result is a deep, smooth, buttery, clean bass note, without those annoying high tones.   Here's the issue with the C2D - they have captured the B3 so perfectly, so closely, so spot on, so 'right down to the smallest detail leve' - that they also produce those awful high freq's in the pedal drawbars.  Arrrrrrrrrghhh!I've communciated this with Pablo who was more than willing to pass along the info to the R&D guys at NORD.  He informed me they have 3 B3's in their studio, against which they model the C2D's.  I offered to share the very simple B3 wiring trick, with a request of providing a download of the sound for my C2D.   Unfortunately, he informs me that they're not in the ""modification"" mode right now so, nutz!Anybody interested in that wiring trick?   5 minutes, promise!  4 snips, 2 twists, you're done.  Yer gonna love it!  (Again, unless you like the stock tones - like nails on a blackboard- just sayin')Also, which leslie pre amp kit would I use to connect my C2d to a 22h Leslie?

The failed component can cause the Nord to see phantom pedal movements (even where no pedal is connected) and respond accordingly.  I would advise your Portland tech to look there first.It remains curious to me that disconnecting and reconnecting audio cables from the back of the Nord would have any effect on the reported behavior, especially since disconnecting and reconnecting the other ends of the same cables seems to have no such effect.

They are really colorful organ. I would argue that they have richer sound than a B3. They usually leak more.The earlier Hammonds has the notes on the TG terminal strip in chromatic order. This required longer leads which increased leakege. Later they routed the shortes way which gave a less ordered sequence on the TG stripI have a switch piggybacked on my Lelsie so that can easily turn off the slow motors making my Leslie work in one speed mode. The change in sound goiung from dead stop is amazing. And as you say the long time to stop acts as a chorus. This why you see som gospel player flipping the swtich on an off quickly often. To keep the lower drum going slowly. And since the top rotor stops in acouple of seconds you realise how much the lower roter contributes to the 3d feeling in the sound. 80% at least.Contratulations to the TG,https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=34003&sid=8859738f9515a540e6dd0e89a35cd3ab#p34003

Since the C2D is (and deservedly so) a huge hit, and a best-seller (watch, it'll be the new B3, the standard organ) it is possible the C2 is now discounted, or may even be eliminated from the line-up, but that isn't the C2D's fault!It reminds me of the libretto from a German opera, which I freely paraphrase here:C2:   ""Oh, Nord C2D, you're so lovely!C2D:  (bats eyelashes)  ""I know it, I can't help it!

If you use the Vox, Farfisa or Pipe organ a lot, a C2 might be a better deal. The LED buttons work fine for those, and you still get the same B3 sound. If you want the ultimate convenience and realism in a B3 clone, it's the C2D with the 5 sets physical drawbars.The C2D (or the next version the C2D2? or C2D MkII?)  will become the standard organ, like the B3 was for so many years.  At the rate C2Ds are appearing on You-Tube videos, it can't be too overpriced. People are managing to get hold of them.However, I will make a generous offer, cause that's the way I am.  Anyone who is dissatisfied with their C2D should get in touch, and I will pay all costs associated (packing, shipping, insurance) with shipping it to me.  You'll never have to see it again.  As the song says ""who could ask for anything else?""  Plus, I'll send you a video of me playing the great Rodgers-Hammerstein song ""You'll Never Walk Again"". (You know, the scene where he's injured on the merry-go-round thingy)  Sounds depressing to me, but if that's what you want, that's what you get.

Found a ""beater"" and a ""mint condition"" around the same time so, while I was in the B3 frenzy mode, I got them both.   Here's the kicker -  Of course not needing 2 B's, I decided to upgrade from my Korg CX3 sooooooo,  I made an even Steven trade from a dealer for a new C2D.   Deal wise, we both won, and I still now have my prize B to jam at home with.    And last comment - there are many, repeat many fantastic features about the C2D, and I love having and playing it.  However - there will never, ever, be anything like sitting at a well maintained B3, and screaming it through a fat Leslie.

Over here, it would probably lead to bloodshed, if not a very nasty divorce.You should hear what goes on in my studio between the A-100 and the C2. Frankly, I had no idea Swedish was such a profanity-rich language, but then again, coming from Chicago gives one a rich vocabulary of pejoratives, too.  Luckily, the recorder was running when I brought the C2 home:A-100:  OMG, what is this? (Starts playing ""Send in the Clones"")C2:  Careful, there, ol' timer, don't blow your last capacitor!A-100:  Listen, lightweight, it took 3 guys to carry me down here!C2:  Hmmm, I thought six was the minimum number of pallbearers...A-100:  Why should I answer you? You're just going to blow away with the next light breeze.C2: Whatsamatter, Grandpa, your key-contacts getting a little erratic? Too many spurious harmonics?A-100: At least I have 9 key-contacts!  And you call those ""drawbuttons""? I have real drawbars!And that was just the first few minutes, and then it got really personal, and in my opinion, needlessly tendentious and invidious.  I ended up threatening to pull plugs.I've got one whining ""You never take me anywhere, are you ashamed of me because I'm heavy?"" and one yelling: ""All you do is take me around to show off to your friends, and then leave me in the case at home, and play her!""  I couldn't take it.Then the C2D came out, and the A-100 was just being cruel about it, so I explained to the A-100 that all the new Hammond-Suzukis were, in fact, clones.  Things are better now, they realise they've got no-one but each other, so they have to learn to get along. But neither of them will ever forgive me for my infidelity.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=32883&sid=8859738f9515a540e6dd0e89a35cd3ab#p32883

Taking only one side of the organ's audio output would essentially be equivalent to that.In a studio production environment I would guess that most producers would want to take advantage of using a stereo feed in most instances.  For live work...sometimes it's less practical to run stereo in club settings or small rooms.  Certainly stereo is juicier and I always try to go that way when I can, but only in mains, not stage monitor.The thing to avoid in ALL situations is to attempt to convert the stereo output to mono via a ""Y"" cable.

Thanks for the reminder about summing the channels and Leslie sim. As a matter of fact, I was doing that with an early Hammond-Suzuki (SM2000) I use at practice (it was $20) because it seemed to cut down on noise and hum. No wonder the Leslie sim sounds so wierd! I mean, it was an early version, but still...I use the high-level 1/4 to feed my Leslie 145, which is equipped with a 1/4 jack and powered by its own cord.The regular output of the C2 is hot enough, I would think, and better still, dead silent.Pablo, could I ask one more question?  Well, I'm gonna.  Is the ""master level"" control on the C2 a digital or analog control?  On a digital control (I hope I got this right) below a certain point (usually about %40-50) the number of digital bits skipped (to lower volume) starts to affect the analog output sound, making it thinner. Therefore, it's best to set the amplifier gain controls so the ""master level"" control on the organ can be open at least to 50% for normal volume range.Also, does the volume controller circuit on the Nord organ (worked by the swell pedal)  control both volume and tone in emulation of the Hammond variable-capacitor swell pedal?  If so, this will effect how one sets both the master level and the volume pedal.Any light you could shed on these aspects would help me  in getting the best out of my C2.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=23890&sid=8859738f9515a540e6dd0e89a35cd3ab#p23890

This is quite common for the type organ that was used.The swell pesal only affects the upper manual (Swell) and controls a set of horisontal wooden ""Blinders"" that open or shut when the swell pedal is pressed. This is volume is controlled for the swell on a pipe.As you add voices in the lower manual you need to press the swell pedal to max in order for the softer pipes to have any chance at all.If you pull all the great they will dominate compared to all swells",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=26846&sid=8859738f9515a540e6dd0e89a35cd3ab#p26846

When I went from playing stereo to mono recently due to space considerations, I found that going out of only one channel didn't work - when the ""Leslie"" would spin away from whatever side I was using, I would lose the sound.  (Obviously I mean the Leslie sim, and spinning away from the virtual mics.  Anywho...)  I needed a way to properly sum these two channels so I could get 100% of the sound information, even if it was compromised by not being run in stereo.I own a Mackie 1202-VLZ mixer, so I sent an email to Mackie to see what they would do; they told me to run the Nord's R and L outputs into channels 1 and 2 (NOT the stereo channels, but I'm not sure why) and turn the pan controls straight up on each channel.  I think of it this way:  The mixer is treating each output of the Nord as a separate instrument, much like if I had run a guitar and a bass on those channels.At this point, you just take your pick as to which mixer output you wish to use - both R and L are exactly the same.  I've found this is really awesome, as I can run a line elsewhere that is an exact copy of what I'm listening to should the need arise.  And for the mad scientists out there, one could have some fun with Aux effects, although that all should happen prior to the Leslie effect...but I digress.Summary:Run Nord R output into mixer channel 1Run Nord L output into mixer channel 2Set mixer channel 1 and 2 pansstraight up 12 o'clockNow mixer R and L outputs have a mirrored copy of your audio; pick one and use it.Play Giant Steps, amaze your friends.Disclaimer:  This may be common knowledge to others, so my apologies if I'm spouting stuff that everyone else knows.

Okay, this was several months ago, but I'm not sure much happened in the interim.  Even if a Ms1771 is not discounted, it's half the price of a  Leslie 122xb or 971.http://www.motionsoundamps.com/about.phpfor specs and contact.

This is why I'm interested in a subwoofer. From my research, some woofers can produce this sound, but not with a flat frequency response. So your mid-range notes will sound way louder than your bass notes.I found this tonewheel chart that explains the frequencies generated by Hammond tonewheels:http://www.goodeveca.net/RotorOrgan/ToneWheelSpec.htmlThis chart lists the lowest frequency as 32.692 Hz.To confirm, I did an experiment where I found the lowest frequency by counting down from A440.I started with a reference tone:Note: we can uncomplicate the experiment by using only the FUND (3rd from left or 4') drawbar. Then we don't have to think about foldback.Using only the FUND drawbar, I find 440 Hz at the 3rd A from the left. The 2nd A is 220 Hz, and the 1st A is 110 Hz. But if you activate the Bass Pedal button and use only the SUB drawbar, you can get one octave lower, 55 Hz (I don't have pedals yet).So the lowest A on the organ is 55 Hz, and referencing the tonewheel chart, the C below that is 32.7 Hz.If you follow my steps, do you get the same answer?My goal is for the whole organ to sound at apparently equal volume, although I'm questioning everything nowI just discovered a Motion Sound subwoofer, the SW-15.

""pedal sustain"" makes it much easier to play a bassline with one foot, the other foot being pretty much trapped on the swell pedal.""pedal sustain"" and ""pluck"" is what the ""Synth bass"" on the C2-C2D gives. The ""sustain"" gives you time to move your foot a third or fourth, and eliminates most heel-toe moves. Every spinet, from every maker, had it. All console size (2x61+25-32 peds) organs had it (except, I think for a few which were supposed to be ""classical"")  But the Hammond console models ( A-B BV B3 etc.)  didn't.  I've always wondered why.Now, as far as I can see, you can't use ""synth bass"" for the mixed LH-and-pedal bass style, the sound of the LM and pedals have to sort of match. But for playing a pedal only bassline, and playing chords with the LH, pedal sustain can be very useful.But again, the weird part it, all the spinets (the M models and later L models) had it for their one-octave pedalboards, but it wasn't put on the 25 pedal models.  Why? running bass with the foot is expounded in all the Hammond instruction books, they were well aware the organ was used for popular music.The only answer I ever got, from an old-line  Hammond tech who worked at Puget Sound Organ, was that pedal sustain required a relay for each pedal (?) and was cost-prohibitive on the console.  But I'm not sure that's right, or that I understood it right. Where are the pedal sustain relays (should be 12, I guess) on the spinets?  Very likely I didn't understand him properly. ""flmc"" might be the guy to clear this up, as he knows the spinets very well.However, I do believe it showed up again in Hammond's post tone-wheel, pre-Suzuki era. But I don't like to think about those models, I just get depressed.Sorry for going on about it, but it's puzzled me for oh, about 45 years since I was 15.  The first time I got close to a Hammond B3 (at my organ teacher's home, I believe) I wassurethere was a pedal sustain rocker, but I just didn't know where it was.

I do believe the sample-based pipe organ is stereo.  Couplers couple the stops from one manual to the keys of another manual. If the coupler has a number after it (4' or 16')  that means the manuals are coupled, but one octave higher (4') or lower (16')  Try them!At a moderate volume. And remember, since the C2D pipe organ is modeled pretty authentically, the swell pedal only works for the swell manual, and the great manual is generally much louder than the swell until the pedal is full open or stops from great are  coupled to it.  The great manual and pedals are full open all the time, so you may have to re-adjust the master volume.  There's a full section on the pipe organ in the manual.And try the numbered programs for pipe organ settings, as they wll have effects in them. Or you can set it up from the panels.  And I believe there some kind of ""bottom-note-of-chord-gets pedal""  feature on the lower manual, and the lower manual can be split in the Pipe Organ mode, too.I hope that helps.

The simulated pedal function (which adds any selected pedal stop to the bottom note you play on the lower ""Great"" manual) can be accessed by turning on the ""Ped/Gr Low"" control.  (That is what it is called on the C2; I presume it is the same on the C2D).  The ""Sub Octave "" couplers (Swell16  /  SW16/GR) allow you to play whatever stops you have selected at the octave below.  So, if you have the 8' Oboe on the Swell & couple this to the Great with the SW16/GR, it will sound as a 16' Oboe.  Unlike most pipe organs, though, I have been told that this effect goes right down to the bottom note.  Pipe organs generally do not have the extra octave of pipes below the indicated footage, so the effect runs out at tenor C.  Just a clarification (unless I am wrong - ""What again?"").  You normally cannot couple stops FROM the Great manual TO the Swell (ie play the Great Flute on the Swell manual).  Oh, and Mooser is right that playing the Pipe Organ through a Leslie sounds horrible.  Just look online for demos & you will hear some truly appaling things!

I do not need the physical drawbars as the majority of the playing will be on the pipe organ & I can just get by with the other samples.  I have downloaded the manul & all seems to fit the bill, but I have a few queries which I hope you kind owners may be able to answer.1) Am I correct in assuming that the presets are: a) treated as 6 Generals (rather than 3-per-manual divisionals) when in pipe-organ mode &; b) adjustable.  I currently use a Roland C180 on which I can adjust the 4 presets very simply.2) When the ""Sw16"" is enabled, does it actually extend the sub-octave to the bottom of the keyboard?  I am currently doing some re-wiring on a pipe organ to give this, but I know that, as a rule, there are no extra pipes.  (Why not?  Even a single additional 3-octave rank, starting at 16'' & called off at the relevant pitch would be better than the bass fading out.  Grrrr!)3) Similar to Q2, does the same apply to the ""Sw16-Gt""?  It would be good to underpin the Gt chorus with a 16' Oboe, but not much point if it cuts off at Tenor C.4) If you have the ""Sw16"" / ""Sw4"" enabled, does this pull through if you draw ""Sw-Gt""?  It would seem a wasted opportunity to have Sw4 available only on the Swell, as you would never really achieve ""Full Organ"".  (Again, on the pipe organ project, if I draw Sw-Gt & Sw Sub / Sw Octave it DOES pull through, but I will be adding a dedicated Sw Sub-Gt for flexibillity.)BTW - unlike some contributors in the other posts, I personally would rather have the Swell as the overall loudest division.  That way, you can have it swell up through the Gt to crown off the sound, but also drop it to below the Gt level for accompaniment.  I regularly play a digital organ with 10 Gt stops & 5 Sw stops &, to be honest, there is little point in opening the Sw as it makes negligible difference.

Yes, when Sw16 is triggered the swell keyboard sounds at both 8' and 16' pitches all the way to the bottom of the keyboard3. Yes4. Unfortunately there is no pull through to either the great or the pedal (with some midi magic this might be possible) in the current firmware the 16' and 4' swell couplers only plays on the Swell keyboard.Interesting note, while designing a AGO 32 note pedalboard for my nord C2 I discovered that 32' pitches were available for the pedal stops (Sub/fagot 16). This makes me suspect that the pipe organ ""samples"" do have some digital patch capabilities beyond the standard settings.The C2 is a fantastic option for a practice pipe organ, its biggest downfall is the relative inflexibility and lack of stops (just basic flutes, strings, diapason, and reed) but when you compare the ""coupling"" options to something like the Hammond SK series (have not personally played) it gets the job done for a fraction of the price and more importantly the weight of an traditional electric instrument.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=31767&sid=8859738f9515a540e6dd0e89a35cd3ab#p31767

I guess there is a logic to having a Sw16-Gt coupler if the Sw16 / Sw-Gt combination does not pull through, but it does seem a shame to not have the Sw4 pull through.  Ah well, it is certainly better than what I have at present & may, of course, be changed in the future.  (Hmmm ...plans email campaign to Nord!)  Sorry to ask again but I presume the presets are adjustable quickly?  On the Roland, it is simply set up the registration (or add / subtract from the current preset combination), hold ""Set"" & the preset piston you want & you are done.  Is it as easy on the Nord?  I often adjust these between hymns to reflect the feeling of the verses, so it would be useful not to require major button-pressing.I have only really done the basics with MIDI, so how did you discover the 32' options & are they working in real-time?  I often use the Roland at the moment for weddings at a large local former school chapel with no pipe organ & a 32'reed would sound stunning there - as long as I do not need to re-program & faff about.  If it is a real-time option, I guess I could play with just the 8' (down an octave), then add the 16' (32') when required???As to the stops, I guess it is a question of how many could be added.  Software-wise, they could include thousands for peanuts, but physically operating them would be the sticking point.

I spent a lot of time with this during my project where I designed toe studs to trigger the presets (http://www.norduserforum.com/nord-c1-c2 ... t4055.html). Let me explain further.The presets are instantly adjustable within each program. Each program has 6 general presets available for pipe organ so if I add or subtract a stop for preset ""1"" it will instantly save this and recall each time I select that preset while I am still in that program. If I want to move to another program I will need to save the program to preserve these new settings (only takes 1 button to save). I can also save on the fly by using the 2 ""live"" banks a very useful setting that nord has implemented in most of its keyboards. The 6 general presets act just like a real organ piston, you get instant switching of the registration with no holdover. I desired the toe stud set up since the nord does not have the preset buttons close enough to do registration changes while still having that ability to play with two hands on deck (like with thumb pistons, toe pistons).I used highlyliquid's MIDI CPU for the pedalboard which really gives you limitless options for midi projects but it does take some DIY effort (lots of faffing about). Again I refer you to the referenced post and the link I give there. The reason I discovered the 32' pitch was I accidentally programmed the pedals to trigger the pedal stops an octave lower than desired for the 16' pitch. It sounded pretty close to a real 32' pitch for the sub-bass patch and reed but I didn't investigate further. Pretty cool thoughAdding stops via midi control is an interesting project to consider. Again the forums on highlyliquid have lots of Haptwork organ designers building very cool things and should inspire...Not having a ton of experience in digital pipe organs I can't speak on much authority in this regartd. I would say IMHO that the C2's full organ sound is still pretty impressive given it is ""sample"" based (again just speculation). The ability to adjust EQ helps, I never use the tremulant feature (you get 6 different types) and rarely have full organ dialed in but I won't be embarrassed by it if push came to shove.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=31812&sid=8859738f9515a540e6dd0e89a35cd3ab#p31812

Looks like a good setup & will, no doubt, get the best from the C2.  At the moment I have just a one-octave set of pedals so it may be an idea to set these up with the MIDICPU so that the keyboard/pedal coupler plays as is on the manuals, but the pedals play the sub octave.  (As long as I don't expect my pipe organ to do the same lol.)I may have not explained the ""additional stops"" bit correctly.  I was referring to your comment about the ""relative inflexibility and lack of stops "".  Many digital organs include additional samples - either complete alternatives or some floating stops.  Even the Roland has a nod in this direction with a ""Brightness"" button, which certainly perks up the Fifteenth, but affects the otherwise rather smooth Flutes by adding a little chiff / articulation.  It only takes a little extra ROM for this, but the problem comes with recalling them real-time for use.  Switching from one set to another on a Johannus organ I played regularly left about 3 seconds of silence whilst the new set was loaded, so no use during a piece, or even between verses, but OK if planned for & loaded before playing.  But, you still physically need a control of some description to select (a combination of button-presses maybe).  Probably too late to expect the C2 to get a dedicated second set of samples, but if they do think about it for the C2D, maybe it will work on the C2 with a firmware upgrade, if there is enough memory available.I guess that, for ""Full Organ"", it is a case of getting the best sound you can.  When I started paying at the local Crematorium, I spent a good hour in the chapel listening to various combinations before deciding what was sensible to include & what had no positive value on the six presets.  The upshot of this was that ""Full"" organ is only about 2/3 of what is available, 'cos the rest do not really add anything to the volume, but just fog up the sound.Anyway, ramble over & my thanks again for your advice.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=31837&sid=8859738f9515a540e6dd0e89a35cd3ab#p31837

And if it plugged directly in with an 11pin cord, I'd adopt it, give it my name, and raise it as my own.That leads me to ask:  Where do the bottom-only Leslies cross-over to the stationary tweeter? I would think the x-over point is much higher than the 800hz. of the traditional Leslie. Wouldn't it be more in the area of 2,000hz?",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=29563&sid=8859738f9515a540e6dd0e89a35cd3ab#p29563

The organ has not ben used that much I think. I had its first period at Kilafors Herrgård (Mansion) 1937 - 1998 ca. When a Pastor bought i by chance. He had it until I bought it two weeks ago.The organ has dual Tonegenerators. The second one is the chorus generator that acts a the extra strings on a tvelve string guitar.The organ still has the early crome ratchet drawbars and I intend to keep it this way.The keys are tte early ""sharp edge"" ones but it is not as bad as everyone said. You do palm smears or the nails.The action is gorgous. Very little sideways play. It clicks just as it should and no settings to worry about. It is a take it or leave it organ.The top end is edgier on the esrly organs since they did not have the tapering that compensates for the topend folback.Next steps is fixing the missing tones and reinstall the tube amp.I also have a M100 TG with the scanner and delay line intactSo I plan to use it sitting beside the organ to give me a scanner vibrato.In my workshop I have the chassis from an L100 so with that i should be able to design at percussion circuit and a vibrato non vibrato pre amp. Also use the poweramp to give me nice distorsion.This unit will also sit on the outside since all mods have to be nonintrusive in order to keep her original.Hope all is well with you.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=29165&sid=e40d085c2134e50db49a909affcec89e#p29165

The Roland Pk-25 has more keys, of course, and is closer to the Nord Pedal Keys in terms of design.  The Roland PK-9 and 7a have fewer keys.  Is there any significant difference in terms of playability and technique?Finally, do you know whethere these bass pedalboards work seamlessly with the Nord Stage via a MIDI cable?

Prior to that I used a PK5 but found that (13 pedals) too limiting.  Prior to that, the full pedalboard of my old B3 and C3 and CV.  If I like and keep the the KeyB Duo Mk111 I hope to be getting in the next week or so, I will likely get the KeyB 25 pedal pedalboard.If you are a trained organist and use proper heel/toe technique, you will likely want a 25 pedal pedalboard, although several good organist (Alan McPike comes to mind)  do very well with smaller boards.  I play in the traditional Jimmy Smith/Joey D/Tony Monaco style and therefore play a lot of left hand bass but I have a long-standing habit of duplicating my hand bass with the pedals so that i can operate the drawbars and/or other controls without losing the bass line.  It soon becomes second nature, especially if you started that way.  A lot of jazz players just tap the pedal (usually the 'A' pedal) to put an attact on the (hand-played) bass note.  That, plus proper use of the expression pedal and a 'stacatto' way of playing the left-hand bass line, works pretty well.  Like everything else, practice makes perfect.  BTW, I play pedals-only on slow tunes.

It takes lots of practise, but boy,,,,,,,is it EVER worth it .  I've made 5 cd's with that kind of set-up, along with a small Korg micro station on an upper tier.

The C2D is the B3 of the 21st-and-a-half Century.Of course, it does occur to me that the ""pipe organ"" is sample-based, not engine-based.  Sure does seem like piano or string samples could be substituted for, or added to, the pipe organ samples. That does occur to me.  I guess I was disappointed when I found out it couldn't be done from the Nord Sample Library or something.There's a gazillion multi-purpose keyboards, but there's only one C2D (or C1 or C2) It's an organ. An SK2 is an SK1 with an extra keyboard,  the C2D is a two manual organ.No, as the young man wailed about Brittany Spears:  'Leave the C2D  aloooooone!'(Disclaimer:  This is my tentative and timidly offered opinion, which I am prepared to change instantly if anybody even looks sideways at me.)",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=28783&sid=e40d085c2134e50db49a909affcec89e#p28783

To do so, you have to take both hands off the keyboard - using one to hold the Preset key down and then adjusting a drawbar with the other - which makes the drawbars completely useless in changing the sound live in real time.  But that is really the major reason to buy a C2D versus the C2!It is technically true that there is no connection between the presets and the drawbars in a real Hammond made 50+ years ago, which I have to believe was the ""logic"" behind this programming decision.  But it is also true that no one I know has ever used the preset keys on a real Hammond.  When playing the Beast, you learn to use the drawbars alone.The C2 and the C1 work exactly as I would expect in today's age - the preset calls up a registration and you can then quickly tweak any drawbar to your heart's content in real time by using the up and down buttons below the drawbar, using the other hand to play (often holding notes to focus attention on the changing sound).  So you get the benefit of a quick preset and also the benefit of real time adjustment to the sound.  Perfect.  That is not the case on the C2D!The bottom line is that the presets on the C2D are just as useless as they are on a real Hammond, which totally defeats the benefits of the drawbars when using any of the presets.  The drawbars are only live when you select the A or B drawbar buttons, or if you hold the preset key down before you adjust them.I'm still stunned.  So I now have to assess whether this is a problem that Nord will fix quickly with an OS update, or whether I should just return the C2D and keep my C2.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=18782&sid=e40d085c2134e50db49a909affcec89e#p18782

The preset calls up a registration and its appropriate effects.  The physical position of the drawbars is not connected to the preset registration (the lights on the C1/C2 make that possible but the physical drawbars on the C2D make it impossible, which is fine).But I would like any drawbar that is moved to adjust the preset accordingly, jumping to whatever position the drawbar is in.  That lets me change the sound on the fly, regardless of whether I start with the drawbar panels active, or a preset active.  You can make a change to the preset registration in the C2D if you hold down the preset button, but that forces me to take me hands off the keyboard, which I don't want to do in a live situation.Example:  I pull up a preset and begin to play in a live situation.  Assume that it has no 1' drawbar in the preset.  As I get to the chorus of the song, I want to add a bit of 1' drawbar to that preset to give the sound a little more top end.  I then want to remove that 1' sound as I get back into a verse.  Since I need all the hands I can use (and then some) to play and adjust the drawbar, I want to be able to do that without having to hold the Preset key down.  I don't want to save the preset, so I'm fine having the sound revert back to the original preset when I change to another.  I just want to be able to change the sound on the fly in a live situation, even if I start from a preset.Does that make sense?  I definitely don't think I would be alone in that preference, but if others want to weigh in, that would be great.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=18796&sid=e40d085c2134e50db49a909affcec89e#p18796

On the Stage 2, if you hold the Shift key and then move any of the physical controls that are not already displayed with the lights, it shows the program position for that control in the display.  Terrific benefit for those of us who want to know how a factory preset is programmed.On the C2D, it would be terrific if that same kind of feature worked to reveal the underlying registrations for each preset (as well as the programmed settings for overdrive, etc.).  Hold the shift key down and move any drawbar that has the LED lit above it (indicating that it is active), and the programmed position of that drawbar in the preset is displayed.Alternatively, Nord could just publish a spreadsheet of some kind that has the registrations and effects settings for the factory presets.  Users who just pick a preset and play won't care, but the C2D is targeted to people like me who really do care about registrations.  I want to know what the presets are programmed to.

Seems to me that the active drawbars should be the set that is active in the preset (denoted by the single LED above each active drawbar).  I think that is A in all or almost all of the presets, but I don't have enough experience so far to know for sure.Agree with you on the revert issue.  If you want to cancel any changes you make to any drawbar settings, just hit the preset again and it reloads the saved settings.  Physical drawbars are out of the picture until one or more is moved, in which case the new physical position, for those drawbars only, overrides the preset.  The saved setting are still valid for drawbars that have not been touched.  That's the way almost every clone I know works these days, including all the Nord products that have the lit drawbars.

If you can use a screwdriver and can carefully/patiently open your Nord you should be able to do it though. This is however completely at your own risk and you can certainly do damage to your instrument (the flat cables between the top panel and the keybeds are the most easily damaged parts when doing this).I've never had a C2 open myself so can't speak from experience, but I expect it to require a procedure similar to what you'd have on an Electro, Stage, Lead, etc. It is much higher though and has two manuals, so there might be more than 1-2 screws on the bottom you need to remove.In the post with the picture of the electro (see the thread I linked earlier), I give a short procedure. I think you need to remove the side panels, the row of screws on the back (the big ones) and the 'odd ones out' on the bottom (probably roughly in the middle, left-right). Don't remove any of the screws used for mounting the keybed(s) to the bottom (their mounted in rows of multiple screws). Once you've removed the right screws, the top panel should lift right off. I think all the screws you need to remove will have a fine thread on them (they screw into metal). If you remove screws with a very coarse thread (self-tappers), you probably removed some screw that's part of the keybed - screw it back, but make sure you don't overtighten it (that might crack the plastic frame of the keybed).It would be helpful for me if you could make (and post) a picture of the bottom of your C2 (ideally showing which screws you had to remove), a picture of the inside (close-up of the main circuit board, I'm curious as to what's in that particular Nord), a picture showing the two manuals and how they are fixed to the instrument. If there are less than four flat cables going from the keybeds to the main circuit board, I'd also be interested in a shot of both ends of any cables that do connect the keybeds to the main circuit board. A shot of the bottom of the top panel showing the standoff(s) that rest on the bottom of the C2 would be interesting too.Since you seem to be living in the US, you could contact Nord Tech Support USA (http://www.proaudioe.com/pages/nord-tec ... rt-usa.php) about this.

And everybody seems to agree it was a brilliant decision, and whatever convenience is lost on the pipe, VX and Farf settings (from the LED-drawbutton models) is more than compensated for by the improvement in B-3 emulation, the physical drawbars. And whoever doesn't agree probably has some weird fear about being injured by drawbars, which are nearly harmless.

Believe me, I know what it is to have too many organs around the house! If that C2D gets in the way,  if you find yourself tripping over it, or pinching your fingers between the drawbars (that always happens to me) or putting it out in the yard at night so there's room to sleep, just put it in a box and ship it to me.   No, no need to thank me, I'm just one of those saintlike guys you read about.  You know, like Albert Schweitzer.  Would you keep Albert Schweitzer from getting a C2D?   I knew you wouldn't!   I'll put a sign out for the UPS man, and take my L100 to the dump, so there's room.  I'll never forget this, flmc, thanks!BTW, the left hand preset switches on the C2D must be pretty convenient. The preset switches (1,2,3 and 'preview')  above the LED drawbuttons are not very handy.

On the positive side, I do not really need it since I am not playing in a band at this point in time and I have a Yamaha Modus H1 piano that I can play for fun. Having said that, I am really looking forward to playing the C2D and have already tweaked the tone in the same way as I tweaked my B3. The big difference is that the B3 had to be tweaked with screwdriver, saw and soldering iron and now I can make exactly the same tweaks with the push buttons! Impressive and satisfying! And I can easily change it without taking the organ to the workshop. And 15 kg instead of 145 kg to carry. Looking forward to using it for real!

In fact, I have always plugged the output from the 3X into the ""main amp in"" jack on the peavey and skipped the awful-sounding pre-amp, useless eq and compression.  Both the Nord and the 3X have an output which is hot enough to drive any main amp, and needs no further pre-amp.Also, powered speakers tend to have very powerful Class D amps, and be much lighter then keyboard amps (unless you must have a Baltic birch-ply cabinet and 2- 15""s, those get heavy!)  Make sure the inputs are combo-plugs or 1/4' unbalanced inputs are available, or you'll need adapters.  And the powered speaker can be used as a ""bottom"" for a Pro3X, which is 800hz and down (it'll x-over about 2k, and probably be bi-amped) and then it's full range can be used for piano, synth.BTW, the Peavey powered speaker I tried (115D) had the same coarse sound as the KBA-100.

Its good to be here...I've had a Nord C1 for several years. I also have a C2 that I keep at my rehearsal space, but I use the C1 every day to practice and write.Anyways, I use my C1 to control a Roland JV880 and an Alesis Nanobass. In order to utilize velocity sensitivity, I have the MIDI channels set to E1, E2, and E3 for the upper manual, lower manual, and bass section respectively. This works great controlling my modules.It's gets tricky, however, when I use a sequencer to help with writing. I have it set up like thisC1 > MPC1000 > Nanobass > JV880 > C1So the MPC recognizes incoming signals and will play them back. HOWEVER, the C1 will NOT play back the incoming MIDI. If I set the MIDI channels to regular 1,2, & 3, only then will it play back the incoming signal. The tradeoff is I lose all velocity sensitivity on my modules.So EVERYTIME I recorded on the MPC I would have to set the channels to E1, E2, & E3 and EVERYTIME I play back, I would have to REset the channels to standard 1,2, & 3 which is a massive pain the arse.(I have confirmed that it is definitely not the MPC because I get the same results on a Yamaha QY700 and using a computer with Digital Performer.)So...anyone out there encounter this too?

I also don't see a way around this (but hopefully there is a trick or something like that).On page 16, it states that for channels 1-16 MIDI IN is enabled, while for E1-E16 MIDI IN isnotenabled. Channels 1-16 give fixed velocity (which is not what you want, but probably the way a real organ reacts) while channels E1-E16 do send velocity data.I think MIDI IN is deactivated when the Nord is generating noteswithvelocity data because the sound engine of the C1 (which is designed to emulate a real organ) does not understand velocity - a real organ is not velocity sensitive (afaik). So it seems they gave the C1 (which itself is not able to do anything useful with velocity data) a keyboard that can register velocity, but in the normal mode of operation (where MIDI IN is active) it does not send this information (it sends a fixed value) via MIDI.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=25756&sid=e40d085c2134e50db49a909affcec89e#p25756

I also used a SPEAKEASY SHOT-GLASS clone with barker switch , which is now on the market. This Shotglass tube pre amp is a pared down version of the Classic, with just a GAIN switch on the side of the unit, plus a BARKER SWITCH IN THE BACK TO dramatically increase the gain when competting with loud guitars, drums, etc. both of these were used only with 1/4 "", though you can get ones to with leslie pins. The Classic was distinctive for it's ability to remain 'clean' at a louder volume. Bruce Wahler did a review of this clone back in 2002 (?)I've also tried the ART MP STUDIO pre amp which was good.Bear in mind, however, that when i say the ' difference with or without the tube preamp is too subtle for my ears to know the difference' that all of us  tend to hear things different.

With my old homemade drawbar box. ""The pidgeons nest""The more i get into to organ playing the more i can get out of the C1.I you mentally assign dual roles to the drawbars you will ger more out of your Nord.Drawbars functions as1. Additative synthesis mixer.2 Graphic EQTake the JS standard sound 888 000 000 C3 percussion third fast soft.You sit in room x and the sound is little boomy. When you solo. Would i then go for the bass in the eq? Nope that would mess up the bass and comp sound in the lower manual.What to do?Pull back the 16' one or two steps. Suddenly the boominess is gone.Same sound 888 000 000 but this time it's hard in the midrange. What to do?Cut back the second (1 octave and a fifth) drawbar a notch.The sound is a little dull?Add a one or two notches of the 8 or 9 drawbar. To att a tiny bit of brilliance.When i hit up a drawbar setting I go for the standard numer first. Then most of the time I will tweak a bit according to my mood/the mood of the song and all else that is going on.If your are in a soft part of the song push the drawbars in a bit.  555 sounds the same as 888 just lower.The life time quest of using the drawbar concept is to learn how each partial influences the mix. McGriff does not sound like JS. I think McGriff often pushed in the 16' a bit in the top manual and used slow deacy or even had the fith drawbar out a bit.Full organ played 888 888 888 can sound horrible.Push in the odds a notch or two and it sounds sweet.So method is when you register is switching between the two modes of regarding the drawbars.1 Start by seeing them as stops.2 Then see them as graphic Eq and tweak the sound so it pleases your ear.It does not matter if you use 888/687/857/ ....... or what ever to get the fundament for a JS sound.  If it sounds good it is good.At the rehearsal I was thinging about getting my C2 instead of using the C1 but I realised that by tweaking the sounds and playing of of the organs capabilitied I got a very good end result.I was using a Motion Sound pro 3x and a cube 60 bass amp.Same thing here. I have adjusted the speeds in unit so they sound good. They are probably not the ideal 0.6 and 6.xx hz.I set them so they  sounded good. And then it works.Also when using the motion sound I will hit c3 when going to tremolo and turn it of when going to chorale.This makes the whole thing sound nicer.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=25675&sid=e40d085c2134e50db49a909affcec89e#p25675

The Hammond pedal channels are switched by turning them on (by plugging in the power supply) while holding the highest pedal down, along with a pedal corresponding to the channel you want to select (channel 3 is low D the third pedal) the indicator-pilot light blinks three times, and away you go, by plugging the MIDI cord into the ""Pedal"" MIDI socket on the Nord.

If your ""l"" pedals have the two threaded holes to mount a Hammond expression pedal, use sheet metal, or even wood, to make an adapter which will hold the volume pedal at the correct angle, and mount to the two threaded holes. The Yamaha pedal has holes in both ends which will bolt it to the adapter.   Basically, the adapter needs to bring the far end of the volume pedal up.  When you're done, you have a pedal set and volume pedal in almost the exact same relation as they are on a Hammond organ. This makes things easier, as everything is where you expect it to be.  The pedal and adapter will unbolt from the bass-pedal console when it's time to move the set-up.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=24216&sid=e40d085c2134e50db49a909affcec89e#p24216

Heck no!  Actually, All you need is a triangular wood block, with possibly a sheet-metal attachment with hole to match the threaded holes for the Hammond volume pedal. Or (and this might be better) just use a block of wood which raises the  volume pedal in the rear, and velcro's to the flat space on top of the pedal console at the toe.  If you just put a Yamaha volume pedal on top of the pedal console, the back of the pedal will be much too low for easy operation.  Take a look at a spinet or console organ, you simply want the volume pedal to be in the same position and angle it is (or as close to as possible) on a regular organ.Mine is sloppy, and I think my description might tell you more than any photo I could take.  Just remember, you need the volume pedal to end up where it always is (in relation to the pedals and organ) and to use a non-Hammond volume pedal (like the excellent Yamaha FC7) on a Hammonk XPK pedal set that mostly means the back end (toe end) of the volume pedal has to be raised with some kind of block.There's no reason you can't velcro the volume pedal to the block, then velcro the block to the pedal console (the long box the pedals come out of).  And then it all comes apart for floor (non-pedal) use. I hope, RevvDon, this is helpful to you.Related to this, I get my best volume pedal action by setting the Yamaha FC7 volume pedal on the ""Roland"" curve in the menu.  More volume in the first depression, and more even throughout the throw. Seems to work better for me.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=24612&sid=e40d085c2134e50db49a909affcec89e#p24612

I ""just"" decide which path and the i gave some time to do other things with the hands until it is time to decide on the next path to take.Do not practice to long at the time.If you play long notes try to rest the leg on the pedal for every note.

(block it up 2,5 cm in the back end).This will help to keep your back strait and the edge of the bench will not press on the underside of the leg cutting off the blood flow.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=24868&sid=e40d085c2134e50db49a909affcec89e#p24868

To flmc's excellent treatise on pedals I can only add this:  Try using the Hammond 16' pedal drawbar to add ""thump"" or pluck to left-hand bass.  You do this by tapping, or whacking (depends) a pedal (it doesn't have to be the right one, in fact, it almost shouldn't be, I use ""A"") at the beginning of each bass note, a tap which only makes the ""pfft"" sound, but isn't sustained long enough to form a note. It works, and will when mastered, add a lot to your bass line. If you want to play either I-V or scalar or arpeggiated bass lines with your foot, try the ""synth bass"" setting. That gives you both ""pluck"" and more importantly ""sustain"", for a smooth sound on intervals which can't be spanned with your foot. Which leaves your left hand free for, well, whatever, comping, block chording, counter-melody, fending off brickbats, whatever. (Be aware, ""synth bass"" with sustain can't be used for ""thump"" with LH bass.)I have also seen many players use the heel for naturals, and keep the toe over the sharps'n flats. This makes chromatic and diatonic lines smoother, but won't get a third, fourth or fifth. The Hammond XPK sets aren't long enough for this (unless one possesses much daintier ""pedal extremities"". I can't do it cause my feets too big.) But your Nord Pk-27's are! Most  pop players don't use the full both-feet technique of classical organ, because you really can't take your foot from the ""expression pedal"" since, well, that's where your expression lives.Very often, a combination of techniques are used:  LH bass with pedal taps for a verse, than maybe shift to a pedal bass with LH chords for the bridge, or LH bass with pedals-and-LH chords for the turnarounds.And if there's a bass player, who hasn't seen them yet, you can drive him absolutely nuts with spurious bass notes.  Who could ask for anything else?",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=24955&sid=e40d085c2134e50db49a909affcec89e#p24955

I've heard that it's not quite as sturdy as the KM. I braced mine by using a plywood ""floor"" which the legs are bolted to, and the pedals sit on, the organ, a C2 is velcroed to the stand, and the entire unit is quite solid. It also keeps the pedal set from directly sitting on dirty floors, which is nice.Also check out ""Z"" style stands. Many of those can be widened enough for pedals.  The OnStage catalog is a good place to start, they are generally available and inexpensive.I might mention (okay, I guess I will mention) that even when I'm not bringing pedals, and use an X-brace stand, I still make sure there are matching velcro patches to stick the organ to the stand. Clonewheel organ are light (Nord the lightest) and a pull on a cord, a swinging guitar neck, or a stumbling lead singer can easily send them crashing to the floor.

I have an electro 3; had the first electro then the electro 2 all of which have been major improvements on their predecessors.Really appreciate this!,https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=18378&sid=e40d085c2134e50db49a909affcec89e#p18378

They didn't have to do that (offer the upgrade). I would, and many other would, have assumed the organ-engines were incompatible.  Now Nord offers the drawbars of the C2D, if that is important to you, or the convenience of the LED system on the C2, if you use other organ types and presets.  And for virtually the same price.They didn't leave C2 owners in the lurch.

I'm betting that 36"" may be more than adequate for your pedalboard of choice. Bear in mind, that the widest width of the 2 octave pedalboard is at the FRONT (TOP) & then tapers down significantly .So the point of intersection between the legs of the bench & where they stand OVER the pedalboard is actually 36"" or less. i know this from experience, because i spent countless hours & days finding a suitable stand & bench. On my C2, i have the WIDEST part of the pedalboard a couple inches in FRONT f the ONSTAGE STAND THAT I USE. The pedalboard tapers significantly enough that THIRTY TWO inches MAY BE ADEQUATE. I'll get back to you on this note. For me, adding the pedals (especially a two octave set ) places the Hammond or clone into a whole new reality. You can even do solo gigs, & use a good rhtym box (like one of the BOSS 660'S OR HIGHER) & YOU ARE smoking !

I didn't know what to expect from the pipe organ but I am very pleased after playing around with it for 3 weeks. I took a listen to the samples offered on the nord website and I'm pretty confident that the Sample library organs are not based the C2/C2D stops.They still sound great IMHO but I do enough with organ for church that I need something I can rehearse registration changes with.I debated between hammond's newer SK models that also had pipe organ stops but I'm very happy that I went with the nord. The layout of the stops and sound balance is great even with all the stops out. It covers the basics, principle, flutes, and reeds. You can get string sounding stops by coupling the vox celeste with some of the softer 8' stops. The couplers were also really crucial for me to have. It seems like nord as limited some of the coupler options with updates, for example not being able to have both the 4' and 16' coupler simultaneously in the swell (i'm guessing to keep the sound under control).If you want great full pipe organ sounds with no fuss I'd go with the samples. I'm not sure about ""airflow"" but the C2/C2D is an outstanding option for the kind of flexibility that a real pipe organ might offer. Its all about what you want to do with it.Hope this helps!-mv",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=23627&sid=e40d085c2134e50db49a909affcec89e#p23627

It is based on the spinet-sized pedals, and extending the white notes for proper heel playing would be great. I like both the Hammond pedal-drawbar and ""synth bass"" sounds on the C2.The problem comes if I want to switch from a left-foot bass (synth-bass with sustain) to a left-hand bass with pedal ""taps"". Can't use ""synth-bass"" for that.  To switch out of ""synth-bass"" is a two-handed operation involving the ""shift"" key, and if I time it wrong, I switch organ modes.  The only answer I've found is to put the same settings on two consecutive program numbers, one with ""synth-bass"" one without. Still clumsy, and their can be hang problems. Remember the ""panic"" button switches the lower manual, not the pedals.flmc59, do you know why Hammond didn't have any pedal sustain on the 25-pedal console models (A-100, B-3 etc.)? I've never been able to figure that out. The spinets had it (and pedal legato) but not the consoles.  For walking left-foot basslines, sustain would have helped.Every other electronic organ Lowery, Wurlitzer, Thomas, Conn, had pedal sustain.  I've never understood why Hammond felt it wasn't necessary on the console models.  They got it, I might add, in the post-tonewheel days.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=23888&sid=e40d085c2134e50db49a909affcec89e#p23888

On Windows you can use 'MIDI-OX'. You can find the download for both with Google.Check out with either utility what the C2 actually sends when playing both manuals. The first variant would be ideal, as you could simply select a different MIDI channel for the tracks in Live that have your VSTi's in them.If the second variant is how it works, you might be able to use MIDI filtering in Live to filter out the lower manual for one VSTi and the upper one for another. You could also have Live transpose the MIDI data to whatever octave you want.I'm pretty sure you can get something working, though you might need to do some investigating.I'd start with having a look at what the two manuals generate (MIDI-wise) and having a look at the MIDI menu on the C2.Cheers,Mathijs",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=23079&sid=e40d085c2134e50db49a909affcec89e#p23079

Running it through a Marshall amp for those early Jon Lord sounds, or through my beloved-and-much-missed 122 Leslie, really made it come alive.As far as Genesis type sounds are concerned, I'm no expert, but I believe that Tony Banks didn't use a Leslie, instead he used various chorus/flanger effects. I suspect that doing something like this will get you close to the sound you're looking for, and that the actual simulation type - B3 or spinet - is less important that you might think.Edit: a quick Google says that that Dave Greenfield also did not use a Leslie.

Matching RED for the C2. I also had wheels put on it. I paid around 200 bucks delivered. I think I'd have done better getting a good hard case from guitar center and gluing some red naugahyde on the sides. At least the wheels on their case (which I own for my Motif) is very stable and has recessed wheels. Not surface mount like the Roadie I purchased.

A cannon for the courthouse square?Nope, it's just the hard case I ordered from ""Road Cases USA"" delivered by UPS.  The case fits the C-2 like a glove.   The case and organ makes a very manageable, compact load, easily carried with the handle. Organ-36 lbs., case, about 20, total 56 lbs. The latches are the ""draw-down"" type, and the handle is spring-loaded, and another latch has a key-lock.The case was supplied with some extra foam, but the organ fits very snugly in the case without it.Here's a tip: The C-2 was loaded into the shipping box with fitted foam ends.  These ends are easily trimmed, and glued into the lid of the case, and come down fitted to the drop between the top and bottom manuals. They hold the organ tightly in place, and make sure the projecting knobs do not bear against the lid of the case, and the organ cannot shift within the case.While the Nord soft bag does have a compartment to hold a stand and music rack, I am very pleased with this hard case. For $149.00 delivered, it seems just right.  If the organ will be handled by others (I don't rate that kind of treatment, especially not if they've already heard me play) stuffed in a truck with other gear piled on top, there are heavier versions, with more reinforcement on offer, but being heavier, they weigh more! (think about it) This one seems fine for my use.I put the three Nord stickers (the ones that say ""Nord"") on the case, and feel pretty snazzy.  End-wheel kits are available as an option, and just screw on.BTW, I noticed that one retailer, Kraft Music is selling a ""bundle"" package with the Nord C-2 that includes aKaces 9KB  bag, which they say will fit the C-2.  This is a lightweight bag with two outside pockets which sells for around $50 and should have the proper inside dimensions for the C-2",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=11461&sid=e40d085c2134e50db49a909affcec89e#p11461

I could borrow a Roland VK7 for a while from a friend, but the thought of using that for at least 2 weeks makes me want to cry.Anyone know how I could order that part on my own, then take the keyboard and the replacement part to the repair guy?

Thanks to Pablomastodon, I figured out what part I had to order to fix the 'rotary control' jack on the back of the C2.  I have a friend who fixes electronics as a hobby, and he took care of installing the part.Friends, be aware!!  The reason that the jack broke is because I left the nord Half-Moon controller always plugged in.  I'm not sure how it happened, but somehow the plug got bumped.  The original input jack was basically shattered- it is a thin, fragile plastic housing which is soldered directly to the mother board.  This happened even though I try to be pretty cautious with my C2...My advice to everyone is to always unplug the Half-Moon switch after you have finished playing.  The repair was pretty tedious and difficult according to my friend, and the shop was telling me that I would have to leave my C2 for at least 2 weeks. (Having to play a Rxxxxx Xx-7 for two days was awful enough, I'd hate to imagine being stuck with it for over two weeks [although I'm thankful I had it!!])Have a good one.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=22448&sid=c4e55725aef784f08e2eb04ade3c2eb1#p22448

I rarely use the presets now when I have two sets per manual on my C2d.And the nice thing about having two is that if you realice that your new sound is somewhat wrong you just tweak it on the fly.I also think that the C2d has the best click emulation at moment on the market. I guess the others will copy in due time. The C2d has the correct responce when you slap the keys.Of course the old hammond is still the King with the nine separate contacts.

The Nord C2 is, in my opinion, the best stand-alone organ clone out there. I had the Nord C1 and they really made some nice changes for the C2: better action, more left hand bass articulation for playing jazz organ bass, better percussion, better key click, etc. Now with the C2d sound engine you've got another Leslie simulation as well.I also have Hammond SK2. If you're not going to use a real Leslie, the SK2 is perhaps slightly better and sounds a bit more ""Hammond-like"" at least to my ears. But, that is completely subjective....up to you. It too has a great action plus all those other voices you can combine with the organ.With the Nord C2 you can run straight from the 11 pin pre-amp already on the back of the C2 direct to a Leslie (I have a Leslie 3300). This is actually  a better set up than a real B-3 which I also own. You control the speed of the Leslie with the onboard controls on the C2 versus a foot switch (which you can't with the SK2 because it doesn't have a built-in 11 pin preamp).U-Tube Eddie Landsberg talking about making your 'Hammond clone' sound more like a real Hammond. He's using a C2 to make the demo and not using a real Leslie - which you don't really need and which is the whole point of not having to haul all this heavy stuff around to low paying gigs with limited space and still have it sound great.Landsberg - truly a great organist/musician with two functional hands -  makes the point that a great clone, like the C2 or C2d, is ""better"" than the real thing. I own the real thing and it: has no EQ, has no variable distortion, has no reverb (unless you have a 122RV), is too friggin' big and heavy, drips oil over the place, is subject to power surges, needs to have the chorus/vibrato rebuilt or it 'motorboats', on and on.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=21937&sid=c4e55725aef784f08e2eb04ade3c2eb1#p21937

Seems that I'm posting very often!Now that I plan to replace my C2 to my new C2D to use in my Rock Gigs, I did more that 20 programs on the C2 to emulate the sound for different songs.I planned in using the ""Nord Sound Manager"" to save the config of the sounds (Sound Up), and then ""Sound Down"" in the new C2D. When I did the ""Sound Up"", the files were saved in""ncpg""extension. After saving all my sound programs on my mac, I unplugged the USB cable from the C2 and then connect it to the new C2D to ""Sound Down"" my custom Programs.When I wanted to open the files, the extension that can be opened is""nc2p"". So, I assume that the C2 and C2D are not compatible.So....what I'm doing is the following:1) Open the Sound Manager with the Nord C2 plugged via USB (where the source sounds are) and select the 1st. sound that I want to save.2) With the two organs On, I watch the panel config on the C2 (Vib/chorus, Percussion settings, and the most important: the lights of the drawbars, and manually replicate each setting one by one it in the fisical drawbars in the new C2D.3) I do a sound check to test if the sound on the C2D sounds the same as the source sound on the C2, and then save the new replicated sound on the C2D.4) After that, I plug via USB the C2D to use the ""Nord Sound Manager"" to give the Sound his corresponding name"".It is a very long process, keeping in mind that I have to carry more than 20 custom sounds to the new unit. I can't imagine a Pro Musician that has to carry more than 50 sounds to a new keyb!So, I'm am asking the following question: I will soon sell my C2. How will I know the drawbars settings of my custom sounds in the future?  If a Nord C3D appears in two from now..And, the extensions of the Nord C2D will not be compatible with the C3D (the same that happened from C2 to C2D).

I have gigged steadily with it for the past 6 months, like maybe 5 gigs a week plus the occasional rehearsal.  So the case gets used a lot.About a week ago, one of the wheels broke off.  The black plastic broke around the wheel assembly, but the wheel and holder were still intact.  I glued it back in place using a good 2-part epoxy, but that repair only lasted for a few days, and then it broke off again.Now I'm trying to decide what to do.  I can:1. Use the case without rolling it, just carry it using the handles.  However, I hate how this makes my hand feel right before a gig.2. Buy a cheap cart to wheel it on, but I really don't like those luggage carts.  And I'm against adding new things to the rig that I have to carry to every gig.3. Get the case professionally repaired, but it might be more cost effective in the long run to buy a new one, considering the zippers are already showing signs of wearing out.4. Buy a flight case.  Are there any flight cases out there with wheels which are recessed into the back edge of the case, rather than bolted on to the side?  Also, is anyone aware of any Pelican-style molded case with wheels that would fit the C2 well, because I used to have a keyboard with a Pelican hard case and it was perfect- lightweight and very protective.

The organ sounds aren't made using samples, but by a simulation of how a tone wheel organ works. Even if you could run the software of the C2 on the C1, it likely wouldn't have the 'horse power' to run it properly. There is no way to magically upgrade a C1 to the organs used on the C2 and the Stage 2.The Electro 4D and the C2D have an even newer version of the organs than the Stage 2; however, as far as I know this new software has also been made available as a firmware update for the C2 (firmware version 2.0).It seems to me you're stuck with either your current setup (C1 as a controller for the Stage 2) or you could 'upgrade' your C1 by selling it and getting something else, such as a 2nd hand C2. The Electro 4D or a (2nd hand) Electro 3 might be an option if you don't require dual manuals.

Then switch.The drawbarset you switched from is now the target for uour changes.You also change drawbar settings on the fly directly on the active set since it is so much faster.The slownes of using led drawbars lends toward using a lot if presets.Regards Frederick,https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=20727&sid=c4e55725aef784f08e2eb04ade3c2eb1#p20727

But if you have to select a preset - look at the display to verify - then play, then half the chorus may have passed.Part of proficiency with the Hammond type organ, or any organ for that matter, is to know how to quickly work the controls. You should instinctively know how to get the sound in your head.On a church organ you should know what a stop sounds like.And what your combinations sounds like.On a piano you spend a lot of time perfecting the touch. On the organ the soundshaping is not how you strine the note. It is how you register it.Allthough the Hammond is actually sensitive to touch.Not from a strength of the note point of view but the attack of the note varies with how fast you press the key. A slow attack gives a longer note on sequence of turning the partials on. Press real slow and you can rear the individual drawbar notes come on one after the other.

It's called the Hammond SK2 and sounds better than the C2. It has an incredible number of rotary speaker models (8) all of which are extremely good. The tone wheels sound better than the C2 and the ability to modify said tone wheels is detailed, varied, and easy to access. One more thing: the action on the SK2 is infinitely better than the C2 which is total mush by comparison and does not feel like a real B-3 which I also own. Also, the SK2 (and SK1) have all those other voices ( good acoustic piano, rhodes, wurli, clav, and more) which the C2D will not have. The C2 does offer the ability to run directly from the organ to an 11 pin Leslie like the 3300 which is a great feature not present in the SK2 but, other than that, who needs the C2D which they'll make obsolete in 18 months with something else anyway.

A function that the C1 C2 and C2d has.Being a tweak freak I somehow like that you can´t tweak to much on the Nords - same as on the B3. I would be tweaking more than playing trying to get that elusive perfect B3 sound.And the perfect no compromises B3 sound comes with 4 legs weighs 400 or so pounds and a broken back if you want to tour with it. But I would love to have a couple of them.Just because they sound so good, play so well, has the old hammond smell.

The last couple of times I got bit on this wasKorg Polysix > Poly-61Roland Juno 6 > Juno-60After this, I usually wait until after NAMM to make purchases, besides, I believe there'll probably be some great deals on the C2 and NP products.In my opinion, there's not so much merit in running with the ""latest and greatest instrument"" crowd.The addition of drawbars to the C2 isn't so much about making you want to sell your instrument and buy the C2D, as it is about taking a larger bite out of the portable organ market in general.

In fact, I do believe the list price of a C2 is 3600 or so and they sell for aropund 3000.That is marketing death right there. It tells every Nord owner 'you could have had drawbars for the same price, but we simply decided not to give them to you!!'Well, I could get really mad about this, but I think I'll go down to the studio and toggle through the programs on my C2. Watching those LEDs dance around and switch form always calms me down, and after about a half hour, induces euphoria. And, unlike physical drawbars, it's non-addictive.

It's getting a 375 lb. Hammond tonewheel organoff the ground, or into a truck, or up the stairs, or through narrow doors into the club and back home again, that is the problem. And sticking your head in the sand won't make it go away, my friend. (B-3s and C-3s with 122s and PR-40s sell for about 2000-3000tops, living room or studio ready in my area, and find few takers at that price! Just check Craigslist)You sir, may have a crew of brawny, tattooed, SK2 beauties too move your rig, but I have to move my own.  My wife (love, honor and obey, my left foot) quit, and won't even move the A-100 out to vacuum behind it.  Well, I bet Gloria Appleton can move a Hammond, almost as well as she can fix a vacuum cleaner!http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0qoz4sZ8p8And See the Appleton Organ videos, very useful:http://www.youtube.com/user/keithappleton?feature=watch$4700.00 list, sounds about right for the  C2D. Organ only, no pedals, etc.  Hey, you want a darn useful, light two manual clone wheel, featuring Nord's absolutely brilliant draw-button-LED system, you shell out about 3G's for a C2. You gotta, just gotta have the two sets of drawbars to high-hat all your friends with Hammond XK's and SKs, you shell out another grand or more. Makes perfect sense.Now, maybe somebody can tell me what those draw-sliders do to reflect the current status of the organ and registration when the program is changed, or a pre-set accessed?  When you access another pre-set, how do you use the drawbars to further modify the registration? Do they ""snap-to"" wherever they are when you touch them? Or do you have to grab and slide the draw-slider and ""catch"" the present setting, and move from there?  The drawbutton system is a damn good one.  Besides, with the whole goddam top of the organ filled with redundant draw-sliders, and tilted, besides! WHERE DO YOU PUT YOUR DRINK AND ASH-TRAY?  Or a plate of food, for that matter?  Yeah, go ahead and buy a C2D, if you need to stop smoking, and lose weight.  Almost $5000, and there isn't even a cupholder?  Oh well, when the sliders snap off, maybe you can eat them. I must admit, those fiddly knobs from my C2 were tasty, and expeditious.Of course, since I stopped moving the tone-wheel Hammonds, I have added quite a few pounds....

The C2D will have improved key-on and key-off clicks, and a change in the way the percussion behaves if you play lines that are almost, but not quite, legato. There will also be some minor adjustments to the actual tonewheel modeling, which results in an increased bass-response. The lower keys will provide more bass, compared to identical drawbar settings on a previous unit.2. Nord are currently working on a new rotary model to be included in the C2D. This is modelled more closely on a 122 unit, than the other two rotary models in the C2. This new rotary model has not been previewed yet, it was not available in the NAMM units.At the moment, Nord are unsure if these changes will be available as an update for the current C2. They are investigating this possibility but this cannot be determined until the C2D is 100% complete and is in production. The Nord Stage 2, however, is not able to get these updates, the hardware in the Stage 2 cannot do this. And neither can the C1.3. The MIDI capabilities will be the same as the C2, so controlling a module from one manual, for example, should not be a problem.4. The C2D is likely to start shipping in the UK towards the end of Feb.

Very shortly after it had hit the market, Clavia launched the C2. C1 owners are still waiting in vain for an OS update that will probably never be available. It is always said that Clavia has such a customer-friendly update policy. In reality, Clavia has often enough used it's clients as OS beta testers (e.g. Electro 3, Stage 2). Also they have always left owners of their older products (Wave, C1) stand in the rain regarding any updates. Clavia's email responses referring to this usually sound a bit arrogant and meaningless. I really hope that they learn to listen better to their loyal ready-to-buy-again customers. Hey, Clavia is charging premium prices. Is it too much to ask for to expect a little more support for legacy products? At least for a little while after the launch of successors. That would be real premium customer service.

When I was a budding organist (about 12 years old) my parents went out to get me a full sized organ, to replace the spinet. I gave them specific instructions to return with a Hammond, and very graciously told them I would settle for an A-100, instead of a B-3 or C-3. (My parents had an unreasoning and overwhelming fear of external tone cabinets, and a rotating speaker would have terrified them into heeby-jeebies and instant syncope. I think they later joined a ligyrophobia support group and received, if not relief, at least the quiet fellowship of those similarly afflicted. The group would get together at our house for a silent sing-along once a month) Anyway, they came home with a freakin Baldwin! Had a built-in ""spinning dustpan"" speaker, but was other wise pretty much a loss. Multi-colored ""stops"" with instrument names on them, no mixture (fractional) stops. 16', 8', 4', and 2' only.  I asked my Mom, very politely of course (she had a mean and sudden left hook, and was not averse to grabbing the first household cudgel she saw and using it on me) why they bought the Baldwin. She told me: ""Those Hammond drawbars have no labels on them! How on earth do you know what the organ will sound like when you set it?""I left home the next day, and never looked back.

On the first occasion the whole organ locked up and would not produce any sound at all. On the second occasion notes hung and the sounds from the reverse preset keys had a delay of approx 4 seconds when switching presets rapidly.This is just stating my personal experience, there may be many Crumar/Hamichord users out there that are very happy with their instruments. Also the architecture of the Mojo may be different to the Hamichord, however my understanding is that both instruments utilise an internal windows based controller to host the VB3 software.Current production models may have improved,  the unit I played was approximately 18 months old.I have also tried the KeyB system and the leslie sim/build quality was not to my taste.So - my search for a clonewheel continues and is now narrowed down to the Nord C2D or the Hammond XK33 or XK3C pro system.If anyone has any unbiased recommendations I would welcome your feedback.

I have a Motion Pro 3x, which sounded great thru my earlier clonewheels, but is very NOISY. For recording purposes, the C2 leslie sim is great. I'm not much of a 'deep' editor, but programing on the c2 is easy, & FUN. The Hammond xk3c seems to be the choice for Jazz Organists who look for a more authentic straight Hammond sound as well as UI, but the Nord , in my opinion, delivers a great 'pure' sound. I , personally, got tired of the generic ""jazz organ' sound (which often avoids the heavy overdrive distortion that I love). after a while, a steady 888 sound becomes, for me , redundant . The drawbuttons are easy to learn, & the programing is outstanding. However, it's a matter of personal taste. You have less editing options than the Hammond, but the Nord sounds so good out of the box, that more me, deep editing is superfluous. The nord is great for Booker t, early Jon lord, Santana, Keith Emerson, as well as Jimmy Smith & others. Essentially, the Nord is created for sound & convenience. It stands out, though many feel that over clones have at least caught up with it & even surpassed it.

Yes, defective. I don't know about you, but I should have put mine right back in the box and sent it on back to wherever I ordered it (Guitar Center? Sweetwater? I forget) but I didn't. I was trying to hook my pro-3x to the balanced output of a vintage Hammond preamp, and assumed (I'm not smart, I admit it) the noise was from the Hammond.Anyway, it turns out that a number of Pro-3x's were defective- they have  bad FETs in the sim portion of the amp, and produce tremendous amounts of noise out the sim (and ""mix"") outlet, at all times, regardless of ""gain"" or ""volume"" setting.The cure, if you can get it back to Motion Sound, is a ""new board"". I am waiting for one now, as they are back-ordered at Motion Sound.  And I am not asking for anything from Motion Sound- I will pay any price they ask for the board, plus shipping, plus a fee to a local audio repair shop who is handling the repair.  But I cannot get my hands on one.So there you go- the Pro3x is not noisy by nature,  you (and I) got a defective unit.The only practical workaround is to put one channel from your C-2 into the Pro3x, and do not use the ""sim"" outlet. Plug the other channel into the ""bottom amp"" and turn the treble all the way down, or use a low-pass filter to feed the ""bottom"" amp.This is really a shame, because I was so impressed by the concept and execution of the Pro-3x I purchased one as soon as I heard about it, and it creates a lot of interest among other players. The tonal difference from Leslie Products I can live with, for the sake of real rotary-horn sound. The excessive noise, (a full spectrum noise, at that!), I can't.Motion Sound has been no real help, unfortunately. I have e-mailed, called, and get no useful response. I wish they would at least acknowledge that there are any number of defective Pro-3s out there.  You can even see this problem detailed in the early reviews at Harmony Central.  And if the Pro-3x goes out of production, is superseded or eliminated from the product line up, good luck ever getting it fixed.In fact, let me try and call MS and see where we are at with this.

""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" uses that effect in the opening bars, if my memory works.The Pro-3x can be used with any bass amp, keyboard amp or even powered speaker which can support the horn. About 85% of the organ sound does come out the ""bottom"", so at least a 15"" with 100 watts would be a good start.  Any frequencies abopve 800hz will go to the horn in the Motion Sound.  So you run the organ to the Motion sound and then to the bottom amp, which may also amplify the piano or synth. But the upper frequency speakers will just not be used when the Motion sound is feeding the lower frequencies only to the bottom amp.It works well, unless there's a ton of noise coming out of the Motion Sound. And there's no way for the PA to filter out the noise, it's full spectrum.My experience is that the Motion Sound horn does not sound quite as sweet as a Leslie, but people notice the difference bvetween the real thing and a sim, and react better to a real horn.

Track no.1 had a drawbar setting of just the 16 foot drawbar, track no.2 had the 5 and 1/3, track 3 had the 8 foot and so on.When selecting all 9 tracks simultaneously in Cubase, all drawbars sound (full organ).Next, I went through and inserted a ""Midi Control"" plug in on each track .In this plug in, under ""Range"", I selected a parameter called Velocity Filter which can be set to a minimum andmaximum value. From the highest drawbar track (1 foot) down to the lowest (16 foot) I introduced a gradual incremental increase to the minimum velocity setting of each track.This resulted in the following;16 foot - Min Vel 8 Max Vel 1275,1/3 foot - Min Vel 7 Max Vel 1278 foot - Min Vel 6 Max Vel 1274 foot - Min Vel 5 Max Vel 1272,2/3 foot - Min Vel 4 Max Vel 1272 foot - Min Vel 3 Max Vel 1271,3/5 foot - Min Vel 2 Max Vel 1271,1/3 foot - Min Vel 1 Max Vel 1271 foot - Min Vel 9 Max Vel 127Although a little crude in concept, the result was something not a million miles away from the real thing.The drawbars can be triggered independantly with differing amounts of velocity on key depressions. The problem of course being that on a B3, as you gradually depress a key the contacts, when made, successively add in each new drawbar.On my experiment, you are stuck with whatever velocity value is initially made when depressing a key and therefore with which of the drawbars you have accessed.As I set such a small minimum velocity value on each of the drawbar tracks, the playing of lines and chords (in a normal Hammond playing style) produces no real difference as all drawbars sound most of the time.On fast repetitions of chords or single notes, some subtle variations can be heard.A similar process could be applied to ""note offs.Where does this leave us?Emulating the buss bar system must involve a multi contact key triggering system of some kind. The Midi velocity system is inherently limited in this respect, but the above procedure (or something like it) doesproduce results that are in some way evocative of the behavior of the real thing.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=20667&sid=c4e55725aef784f08e2eb04ade3c2eb1#p20667

I have been an organ junkie for the last two years. At this point in life, I realized what fun instruments you can get for only 50 Euro, if you buy an organ. So far I have two: One Wersi Comet from ca -82 and one large Viscount combo organ from ca -75. Soon I realized I need some instrument with Hammond sound, and I've been investigating solutions for a while.Some weeks ago I was looking on a 2nd hand C1 for sale. But the guy had little technical knowledge about what he was selling. In particular he had an expression pedal (Boss FV-500) where you could route stereo sound through it. He had routed a mono line from the organ through the pedal. So I took the two cables and routed a stereo line to his PA, to at least here the Leslie sim throgh stereo. However, the expression pedal also had an expression-connector that should have been connected with a stereo-1/4"" plug to the organ expression outlet, in order to mimic the Hammond expression pedal characteristic. But this guy wasn't aware the expression pedal also change the timbre of the instrument and he didn't have the correct cord for this.The thing is the instrument didn't inspire me in particular. I may not be used to it, not knowing how to adjust it for an inspiring sound. But what was really puzzling was how thin the lower manual was. When I controlled the pedal voice from the lower manual, I could play left hand bass. But when I was only relying on the drawbars, the bass was very thin. Despite a registration maximizing the 16' and 8' drawbars.I was thinking that perhaps the organ was playing as if I was pressing the expression pedal fully, when there is no pedal connected. Perhaps the upper manual (and the treble) is playing quite loud, when there is no pedal connected. Is this the case? Do you get a thin response from the lower manual, when there is no pedal connected or what? Does that mean that an expression pedal is absolutely necessary to get a good balance over the keybed?",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=17884&sid=c4e55725aef784f08e2eb04ade3c2eb1#p17884

As the upper and lower manuals use the same sound engine and same drawbar system, there is no reason for the lower manual to sound different from the upper manual. Unless the organ is faulty, which is unlikely, I suspect the problem is more likely to be in the way it was being used due to lack of experience. It's unlikely to be the amplifier or cable connection as that would affect the sound of the whole organ rather than just one manual.In short, the organ should work just fine without an expression pedal, it should make no difference to anything. Of course, using an expression pedal for Swell is strongly recomended for musical reasons.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=17964&sid=c4e55725aef784f08e2eb04ade3c2eb1#p17964

This is oppose to an old Italian organ (Farfisa, GEM etc) which have a pedal with lamp and LDR resistor. This type of organ would play its loudest, if no pedal is connected.I also assume that the expression pedal doesn't affect the bass pedal voices at all, as I didn't find these voices to be thin in any way, when playing without expression pedal connected.The thing which I don't understand is that you (Fredrick) say I should expect a weak midrange without the expression pedal connected. But I found the lowest octave in the lower manual to be thin. I mean, this octave is producing bass (rather than mid) when the 16' drawbar is all the way out. When playing left hand bass on a Hammond, you don't control bass pedal voices, but still get a decent bass level with only the 16' and 8' of the lower manual. Right?I'm curious on this because of an injury in my left leg, I can hardly play bass and expression pedal at the same time. In order to get some kind of control, I have to play one of them, with my right foot. One of my old organs has pedals and I have put them to the right in order to play bass. But I'm thinking that perhaps I can't get an interesting sound without the expression pedal and perhaps I should practice left hand bass instead, in order to be able to use the expression pedal.Another option could be to build some kind of knee level (for my left leg) in order to control expression.What do you guys think: If you had to chose only one of bass pedals or expression pedal.

I would keep the Bass Pedals ! But I would MISS the expression pedal, & would make EVERY attempt to find an ergonomic solution to having to play BOTH.As far as left hand bass & pedals , many of us do BOTH. In a walking line, for up tempo pieces, the left hand is needed to play most of the line, while the foot taps an 'on the beat ' accompaniment when playing in FOUR. When playing in TWO, my left foot plays the root & 5th (usually) & the left hand the in-between grace note accents. The same goes (for me at least )for Latin (bossa, samba,beguine, rumbha,) & funk & rock-jazz. I would heavily advise practising root & 5th on songs, starting S-L-L-L-O-O-O-W-W-W--L-L-LY-Y-Y, THEN GRADUALLY INCREASING THE TEMPO. THEN....seperately....practise the left hand . : walking in 4, in 2, etc.   Later on, you can get innovative :  play DOUBLE-OCTVAVES on seperate or same manuals. use either a metronome   tapping on beats 2 & 4.  Years ago i got tired of the metronome & bought a Boss 660 drum machine  ( don't laugh, it comes in handy for SOLO GIGS !)",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=18030&sid=c4e55725aef784f08e2eb04ade3c2eb1#p18030

Then you will get at bassier soundThe Swell pedal affects the bass pedals as well.The C1 is weak in the last octave of the 16"" foot. This is a know issue of the C1.Now if you combine that problem with having no swell pedal connected you get a very weak sounding  838 000 000 sound (regardless of which manual).It is very common I think for C1 players to use the Pedals to Lower function.Or you have to turn up the bass a bit  / use a bass e1 and raise 50 hz quite a bit. The roll off happens around 125 hz.Turning on a bit more of the second drawbar also helps a bitThe C2D and the latest upgrade for the C2 fixes this problem with the 16`lowest octave.As for solving the problem of bass and volume with an injured leg.Can you move the left leg sidewas - a knee operated swell could perhaps work ?Play bass with right footLeft leg has a knee paddle for volume.Frederick",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=18035&sid=c4e55725aef784f08e2eb04ade3c2eb1#p18035

With a bass that is weak in general, and a somewhat boosted midrange, the result is the lowest octave produce a very thin sound, even when 16' and 8' are maximized.I have been concidering Nord Electro 3 too. But then I suspect this keyboard will also be thin when playing left hand bass, as the organ sound is the same as in C1. Right?The C2 was also thin in the bass, until the new C2D software appeared.I find this a bit surprising. I mean C1/C2 has been around for many years and has been thin in the lowest octave just until now. That is surprising concidering how they are used.Regarding my left leg. Yes, it's only the foot that is injured. It hangs down. In order to operate bass pedals, I have to raise the whole leg to change note which is clumsy. Precision sideways is poor and toe-heal is impossible in the case of long pedals. But I should be able to operate a knee paddle as found on some old organs. So that could be a possibilty for the expression control.robnuckels: I also find the bass pedals to contribute more to the total sound than the expression pedal. I was asking partly because Eddie Landsberg emhasis the importance of the expression pedal in some youtube videos. Thanks for the practice advices. I don't laugh at drum machines.

I anguished over two things, no drawbars and no 122.   Wouldn't you know it, the two major features in the C2D are drawbars and a 122.  Ahhhhhhhhggggg!!!!!I am convinced that I am the keyboard jinx.   Just when I have saved up enough money to buy the latest piece of gear, a newer version when the features that thought were missing are then included in the new version.  To get the C2 just right for me, I had to save up extra to get a Ventilator ($450) and some Ocean Beach Digital drawbars ($300).I missed being able to return the organ to my dealer by 4 days.

And, of course, 33 days later, Nord announces a new organ.   When I saw the website teasers around Jan 10, my jaw hit the floor.   You see, I saved up for over 18 months to afford the organ.   I anguished over two things, no drawbars and no 122.   Wouldn't you know it, the two major features in the C2D are drawbars and a 122.  Ahhhhhhhhggggg!!!!!I am convinced that I am the keyboard jinx.   Just when I have saved up enough money to buy the latest piece of gear, a newer version when the features that thought were missing are then included in the new version.  To get the C2 just right for me, I had to save up extra to get a Ventilator ($450) and some Ocean Beach Digital drawbars ($300).I missed being able to return the organ to my dealer by 4 days.  So, you'd think I'd be really pissed off...but I'm not.   I look at it this way,  First, I am extremely pleased with my C2 rig.  It sounds like a dream to me.   I have drawbars and a 122 so I'm good to go.  Second, it makes me happy that Nord is continuing to invest in the organ to make it the best it can be.  Keep on tweaking.   Third, I believe this product was to dig into the SK* series from Suzuki. That means Nord is competitive, which means it will be around for a long time.If you feel slighted because you recently purchased a C2, don't.   Not only did you buy the best B organ out there, you made an smart investment in a company that will continue to make the products the best they can be.

Some of us did indeed buy at anunfortunate time, however all the future C2D owners will eventually face the same situation. Continually jumping on the new gear bandwagon is great fun, if you can afford it!  I cannot.

This instrument was so ahead of its time it took until the 70´s for these sounds to reemerge.http://www.novachord.co.ukHave look at the pages and listen to the sounds. From a 1939 instrument.Back to drawbars.The Nord button system and leds replicate the function very well. The area where it is not as good, i.m.o , as the original system is the speed of finding the right sound.With physical drawbars you pul or push until your ears says fine. With time this becomes automatic so you compensate for the room with the drawbars.You can of course do it with the buttons as well but there is something about the speed and exactness of having nine real ones. You can also adjus multiple drawbars in opposing directions.I played my C1 for over a year before i took some old spinnet drawbars and bulit a midi version for the C1. And it got me a new instrument. I quickly found the sounds i was looking for.My recomendation for a C1/C2 owner is to upgrade with a ocean beach unit. Then you have a SK2 with the addition of the button drawbars for the other manual.There is a dual unit by Jazzfer.I would also like to point out that C1 and even more so the C2 are very nice instruments to play - they have soul.So I fully understand those of you who feel right at home with the C1/C2.

It could even look like a drawbar ""head"" (the brown, white or black plastic part you touch)2) the rocker or tab to operate the tone could be ""velocity sensitive"". Press it softly, move one position, press it harder, more movement. Several different curves could be a choice in the menu.3) Eliminate the buttons completely, widen the LEDs a bit, and have the LED follow the movement of a finger over its surface, drag fingers down for more, up for less.Those are just three of the many ways to retain the advantages of the LED system while making the feel of the drawbuttons more ergonomically intuitive, the drawbar's main advantage.Of course, if Nord-Clavia wanted to advance me $500,000 for further research, I would start by flying to Sweden, and then keep right on going.

It was generous and thoughtful of Nord.But since this is a funny story thread, I've got one. Well, it was a tragic time for me, and I don't mind telling you that Hell's foundations quivered for a bit, but now I'm back in the pink, on velvet, and ready to talk about it.  It happened end of June.  About three years ago, I purchased a Motion Sound Pro-3x rotary horn amplifier. I liked it, but I always felt the noise floor was much too high for what it cost.  I called the factory, and they promised to send me a new ""main amp board"" as soon as they got them in. Okay, I waited, I called, and after months and months, they finally sent me one, and charged a nominal fee. Very good.  I had waited so long for it, and hated the excess noise so much! But still, the sensible part of my brain said: ""Listen, Mooser, the thing works, even if it's a bit noisy, so put this board on the shelf, and use the old one until it fails, or you are entirely sure you understand how it goes in"".  The little devil on my shoulder said: ""Don't listen to Mr. Sensible! You've waited a year for this board, and after all, didn't you re-cap your A-100 sucessfully, in one overnight session? Go ahead put it in!""  So I did, and when I flipped the ""on"" switch there was a noise like the Last Trump and sparks! I blew up the board!  Oh crap!  ""Okay"" I told myself, ""Steady on, old son, you've still got the old board""  So I put that one back in, and blew it up, too.  ""For God's sake"" I said, whitelipped and trembling (or are they my accountants?) ""Don't panic, just call Motion Sound and order another one"" So I went to the web, and boing! No Motion Sound website! No one answered the phone, and e-mails bounced back.They had just gone out of business that day!!Well, I didn't take it too hard, I just stopped eating, and began wearing a hairshirt and flogging myself with a chain. I felt like a guy who went hunting and shot his own beloved dog, or the guy who bought a new motorcycle, parked it in the driveway, and then later hopped into his truck, flipped the autogarage door open, and backed out over his new bike!  I was pretty low down among the wines and spirits, neck deep in the soup, and wondered where on earth death's jolly old sting had got to.  In fact, going gently into that dark night looked like the best option about then....What was I supposed to do, use Leslie Sim? Nooooo!Anyway, I have a friend, Barry, who comes over every Saturday morning for a music lesson. Well, Barry works at the public TV station KCTS, and I had always thought his job was to go after recalcitrant contributers and remind them they can keep their kids or their public TV membership, and they better make up their minds which, or something like that. Or maybe he played the romantic heavy in Spanish-language educationalnovelasproduced at KCTS, I never really knew.  Well, Barry noticed my distress, and asked me what was wrong, and I told him, between sobs, and long pulls at the gin-bottle, and banging my head on the floor. (I was trying to show him I wasn't upset)""For God's sake, stop sniveling, Mooser, and wipe your nose"" Barry said, offering me his hankercheif. I took one look at it, and went to find a paper towel or something.

I brought them, and he said ""You callthisa soldering iron? Get me a file!""Anyway, in fifteen minutes he had analysed the problem: some of the SCRs controlling the rotary horn motor should be grounded to the heat sink, and some insulated electrically from it, and I didn't understand this when I tried to put it in, and I had burned out a ""trace"" which supplied them with voltage. He ""jumpered"" the circuit board, as he's been doing since he was a wee tot,(that was some deft soldering, I must say) bolted it down with the right insulators, and I began to live again as the horn rotated and sound above 800hz swelled forth.And life goes on, I've regained the four pounds I lost that week, and I've even stopped shaking.

I have owned several B-3s and wanted something to substitute so I dont have to haul one. Apparantley the nord C2 is suppose to sound like a B-3 and you know I am totally willing to make compromises really. problem is I only had 2 weeks to try it but by the time I got everything to hook it up to an actual 122 lesle 2 weeks had gone by. Now that I have the draw bars are not working like a B-3 at all, For softer voicings which I use all the time- you should be able to hear the high keys as much or more than the low keys for instance a setting of 113305436 you should be able to clearly hear the high keys over the bass keys on the same manual- not so on the nord. On a hammond if you play a triad on the lower keys of that manual and you play a melody on the higher keys of the same manual you will hear the high keys easily- on the nord you can only hear the triad, the higher tones are completely drowned out by 100% This severely limits the tones you can get to 2 or 3 useable settings period- might as well be using an M model hammond. Needless to say I am a little or more than a little pissed but not so suprised by all the youtube and forum comments on how the nord sounds just like a hammondis there something wrong with my nord or is there something I can do to make it function like a B-3??? As it is the drawbars do not function at all like a B-3- you must have heard this before if something is wrong or you hear it over and over from people that own real hammonds if nothing is wrongI own one of the most well known electric guitar pickup companies and deal with tone every day- check it out Jason LollarLollar Guitars Lollar Pickups I am not a dummy.I bought mine from seattle guitar center and they did a really good job finding me what I needed but they didn’t really know the keyboard or the difference between it and a B-3 or comparable Hammond.why cant you email nord direct about this stuff?

I tried all the tonewheel settings V1 V2 V3 and cl the the leslie model set on A but I tried the original emulation too. eq is set at flat- I tried boosting the treble- no difference.When I plug the C2 into a leslie I am using the corresponding 11 pin to 6 pin hammond adapter for a 122 and when you plug that in the keyboard appears to bypass its amp setting- it would be nice if you could run all of the organ models through the leslie- it appears the pipe organ wont route there but oh well. I also have a 1971 twin reverb with two EV classic speakers that I run for my rhodes and couple of vintage synths- results are the same running the C2 into the twin from the right or left output.heres the funny thing- no problem hearing the upper two octaves while playing with both hands on one manual when the organ is set to a vox or farfisa. I am hoping the problem isnt the way the fold back is set on the B-3 patch as when I jump over to my hammond- its a 57 B-3- my upper two octaves stomp all over the C 2 with the same drawbar settings. i can work around it, its just frustrating to run into a limit Its really on the softer settings the problem is occuring- its not acting the same with louder settings like 88880000 or 888023468, once you drop the lowest draw bars the last two highest octaves loose something- it sounds like its missing a lower tone than my B-3 has, The C2 is like squelchy sounding and the B is noticably louder and woodier on the top two octaves. If it turns out there are things I cant play on the nord- I guess I can deal with it for the portability factor but hopefully its something im doing wrong that nord will help me figure outcheck this out hanon if you have timeon the lower manual set the drawbars 000801248 with no chorus or vibratohold the lowest C down and then play the C on the next octave up- good volume match now hold down the 2nd octave C and play the C in the third octave up- good volume match again now hold the third octave C and play the c in the 4th ocatve- still ok you can hear both clearly after this it changes hold the 4th octave c and play the c in the 5th octave- its almost drowned out hold the 4th still and play the highest C and its drowned outon my hammond  my lowest C is a little softer than the nord- no big having some difference in fact I wish my b had a little louder low C but the highest two octaves played over the 4th octave C on my B stomp all over the nord volume wise, maybe I got lucky with the hammond I have and its extra fat.

I tried it once in rehearsal to see if it could be used for a pitch-bend at the end of a solo, but it just sounded stupid and was too difficult to control - you had to hit the (momentary) footswitch again quickly to turn the tonewheel ""motor"" back on. I've been thinking of getting a Behringer pitch-bend pedal for this kind of thing - it seems much more controllable.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=11591&sid=c4e55725aef784f08e2eb04ade3c2eb1#p11591

The Nord volume control on the C-2, if I understand this correctly, emulates the action of the Hammond variable-capacitor volume pedal.  So the tonal balance, as well as the overall volume changes as the knob is turned, or as the volume pedal is operated.  Try turning the Nord volume up, and the amp volume down and see if the balance doesn't change.If it's any comfort, I checked, and a Hammond does the same thing: the tonal balance changes a lot, along with the volume, as the pedal is depressed.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=11855&sid=c4e55725aef784f08e2eb04ade3c2eb1#p11855

The more I listen to the C2 through a 122 or a fender twin amp with EV classic 12's the more I can hear a big EQ difference- the nord is heavier in the midrange than my B3- I would describe it as honkier and a little wheezy compared to the B which has more clairity warmth and sparkle and the difference doesnt EQ out either. Using the onboard EQ doesnt create the correct frequency response.I know there is always a compromise - you wont get a rhodes to sound like a whurly or a fender amp to sound like a marshall etc and at best differences will be subtle.

Much like what you find in old radios where you change the capacity by moving the plates in and outThe B3 has two sets of fixed plates - one movable that moves between set A and set B.On one set you have direct organ sound full volume - on the other side you have a resistor network with a couple of capacitors.This network attenuates the mids much more than bass and highs.So Back of max on the Swell. Now you have a lower volume that has a very strong curvey. like a concave eq qurve.As you move the pedal the sound gets louder and the mids are lifted up to a strait Eq curve at pedal to the metal.So the Swell acts as a parametric filter and volume control.Brilliant solution and it can basically never wear out.The Nord Combo organ acts the same.So what you should do is - Always play with the volume pedal all the way back to 50% on - The range 50% 100% is when you want to make an FF accent.I use the distorsion button as a form of volume soft. If i need to go down in volume I turn the distorsion off (from its usual 11:00 to 12:00).To repeat - set the volume of your amplification so high that you will play with the swell pedal well backed of 80% of the time.This will give you a sound with nice highs and if you wanna bite the audicence press on the Swell pedal.Regards Frederick,https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=14382&sid=c4e55725aef784f08e2eb04ade3c2eb1#p14382

The thing was, that I was using an external ""drawbar"" module (DB-1 from Ocean Beach). This module is connected to the C2 via I/O midi cables. This module has 2 aux midi, to connect to other midi devices, so you don't lose the midi ports. So, the MIDI connection chain was: The Nord C2 was connected to the DB-1 and then, the DB-1 connected to my computer. So, it seems that the DB-1 (that was in between the C2 and my computer) was not understanding correctly the info sent by the computer software, and sending bad midi signals to the C2 Keyboard.How I solved it? I bought a MIDI 4x5 interface. I connected the C2 to one of the I/O ports of the MIDI interface and the DB-1 to another I/O port. Because this  MIDI inferface works like a midi ""matrix"" I gave the instructions of link this two I/O. After doing this, no strange midi symtoms that I was experiencing like ""eternal sustain"",  sudden  ""delay"", ""sudden change of drawbar settings"", etc,.Of course, all the C2D users, will never have this problem in their lives!Thank you to all the folks who read this article, and specially to the people who tried to find a solution.Regards,2xbasssist",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=18729&sid=c4e55725aef784f08e2eb04ade3c2eb1#p18729

And I don't like the overdrive knob on the up-right of the organ. I prefer find it on the down-left like Viscount.I have a question: on the Viscount I have a knob which changes the volume of the lower manual, keeping still the volume of the upper manual.I can't find this function on the C2D.

I was hoping that I could use the internal sim through the stereo pair whilst the hot output would be straight.If you could measure it that would be awesome as I might need to get some device to convert it to a signal the OD unit can use (it's pretty flexible but if it's too hot, well, I'll have to find a way of taming it a bit... di box or similar with a pad.. probably end up making some static solution suitable for my setup that hopefully can fit internally.

The c2d I am using on a z stand with the hammond xpk 200 pedals. It has the appearance similar to a vox continental.On comparison of B3 sound I would say that the KeyB through the neo ventilator is still the closest , and the Nord with its own simulations are a more reedy tone. I know if I put the Nord through the vent then it would be spot on, but the object of me buying the Nord was for A drawbar organ with light portability and quick to set up at my gigs. I,ll be using an Orla xm900 expander midied through the c2d for the extras like rhythm and other instrument sounds, but I don,t want to have to start adding extras like leslie sims at a gig because it means more cables and not enough time to set up.

Maybe try individual notes then add in simple chords to more complex chords across the spectrum and see where the problem begins? Just some thoughts but since no else had an opinion I figured I would try to help at least a little. Let us know what you find.

The Jack goes into the NORD Rotary socket and connects to a little black box, the box has a DIN socket which takes the plug from the B200 pedal (or any other Hammond Pedal such as the one you pictured)  the little box is also attached to a 12v power supply that has the variable voltage setting, we got it set at I think 4volts which gives the best swell range for volume. The Hammond Pedal has a light bulb 'thing' inside which controls the volume and that's why you need the power supply.

It follows that this sound put through something which rotates ""right"" should do a bloody good job. I am currently looking at Sharma Cabinets. They are bombproof, about 1/4 of the price of a ventilator and are very loud without adding their own ""tone"" to the Nord. If you put a tonewheel hammond through one, they sound very very bad, however, the Nord is a different animal.I think I had some very old 6L6G tubes which I used instead of 6550s in the leslie.

This signal can then go into the Vent in mono, then you can take the stereo, post leslie effect, out from the Vent to your amp or mixer. As I thought about it, this made sense as feeding a stereo signal into a leslie and having the two stereo parts swirling seperately would be likely to sound wierd; ceratinly not how a Hammond/ Leslue wold work.

I have took the gamble and ordered one as I usedto have a Nord C1 and liked it very much although I am one of those players who always prefers physical drawbars which is why I have been tempted by the C2D. I like the Nord sound and not to worried how close to a Hammond it will sound as I am more of a lounge lizard than a jazz player.Although my Cd2 is supposed to be arriving maybe the end of next week, I am really curious to know how the drawbars will affect the organ when in Farfisa mode as on the previous models the tabs are either on or off. The same goes for the pipe organ I suppose, so I am wondering if the drawbars will act as volume sliders instead of on off tabs, if so then this would give me quite a bit of scope for blending the different stops together.If no one here knows how the drawbars will operate in the Farf mode thenit maybe the case that I will be one of the first to find out , then I will have answered my own question but neverthless will report what I find out on this forum in case anyone else is wondering the same thing.There does not seem to be much info and the PDF user manual is not available as yet although some of the Naam videos on youtube are good, so I'll just have to wait I suppose.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=13588&sid=8e0126e2b4b28d7a32562263ec59cde3#p13588

Amazingly, Google seems to have little on the topic; all I could find was Nord fans railing about ""clean"" sounds, and portentous ignorant idiots warning us to be very very gentle with our keyboards....Which isn't such a bad idea, although I doubt the plastic'll suffer much from ammonia. But dripping the stuff into the electronics is obviously a little chancy, which is where the ""Spray Gel"" comes in; it tends to bead-up instead of dripping.

I own a Nord Electro 2 Rack I have been using with a Technics P50 keyboard. I have recently bought a Nord C2. In order to keep the playing kit simple and still get the Rhodes and Clavinet sounds from the Electro, I was thinking of connecting the Nord C2 to the Electro through MIDI to use the Rhodes sounds whenever I needed without having to use an additional external keyboard. This all works fine except the fact that the Nord C2 is not sending velocity information other than Note On/Off. In the manual it says it also sends (and receives) the speed at which the note was pressed, which as you know, is a must to play Rhodes. My too questions are:- Is it possible that the Nord C2 cannot actually send this information?- Could I use the Sound Manager to load Rhodes sounds into the Nord C2 and play directly on it instead of plugging it through the Nord Electro Rack?I am investigating from my side, or course, but any external help would be very much appreciated.Best regards!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=9671&sid=8e0126e2b4b28d7a32562263ec59cde3#p9671

With the digital buttons it is easy to miss the sweet spot when they count up/down past the reight spot.i know of guys who are very proficient with the digital one.If any of you read this - tell us how you work the buttons in the best way.When i play with the physical drawbars this seams to work better - for me.

Hi. I have a post (right next to yours!) ""More Pipe Swell Pedal?"" where I complain about a minor problem with the Nord pipe organ simulation -- the swell volume control actually only controls the swell manual! A surprise, but hardly a significant problem in your quest.Please go viewhttp://owenlabs.org/rant4.htm#nordfor my extensive and sometimes-disordered thoughts on the Nord pipe organ and, as it turned-out, the B3 simulation. Briefly, I think they're top drawer, and I don't think you can get anything near for the price -- which is about $5.3K, including Nord pedals, for me in the states -- at least in the pipe organ simulation area.As noted somewhere there I equipped my unit with two Behringer ""Truth"" B1030As amplified ""studio-style"" monitor speakers for less than $230. I doubt that would be appropriate for your church -- the cardboard's exposed, if nothing else -- but they *are* relatively cheap. The ""200W PA speakers"" or the keyboard amp sounds likely to me -- but I'm ignorant. ... The Nord emits a pair of line-level signals which should run any of those, with perhaps some kind of mixer to get both stereo channels into mono; my guess is a major reason for the stereo is to enhance the reverb -- of which I am quite fond. But I don't have access to ""a very reverberant 1841 church"". You can download the Nord manual in pdf form somewhere....-- good luckj.g. owen *http://owenlabs.org/rant4.htm#nord",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=11164&sid=8e0126e2b4b28d7a32562263ec59cde3#p11164

I thought I should also note that *any* decent clonewheel/hammond keyboard would probably make a plausible church organ -- with reverb, and if you turn-off the vibrato. Your church has the reverb already, and many modern keyboards have a reverb effect anyway. If one uses a few drawbars appropriately, it can sound quite ""churchy"". But not with the throbbing vibrato.It won't do a good full organ, although it's not *that* bad. Nothing of course compared to the Nord C2 pipe simulation. But presumably considerably cheaper. ... Of course you would also leave off the pedal keyboard, which is costly -- again, not essential for a ""churchy"" sound. And of course the second manual, likewise.It hurts me just to think about it, but if money is short....-- best wishes,j.g. owen *http://owenlabs.org/rant4.htm#nord",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=11201&sid=8e0126e2b4b28d7a32562263ec59cde3#p11201

In a good pipe organ installation very little direct sound reaches the listener, and it's considered better if most of the sound reflects from at least two surfaces before it reaches the ear. Yes, the output from the Nord will very easily drive two 200watt powered speakers. And powered speakers are not expensive. But when they are loud enough to fill the chapel, you may end up with a mess, too loud and harsh near the speakers, and possibly a muddle elsewhere, with standing waves and nodes.I'm with Hanon, you should consult a sound engineer who has experience in this type of thing.   The systems I have seen for electronic church organs use multiple speaker installations, and possibly active sound processing to achieve an even sound dispersion and frequency balance along with reverberation control.And don't disparage my suggestion for a Gospel-Gregorian synthesis.

The Nord is actually a much of a muchness. I have sold all my old kit and now run an EX88. I don't have a problem with the weighted action and organ, it's fine.Although I had several  6 pin leslies, for laziness or whatever, I used to run them through PR40 speakers and the sound of the EX88 without the leslie is very similar. I also bizarrely ran it through hifi speakers (I think through the reverb out on the amp) and it's very ""headphonesy"". People forget the Hammond is a raw signal generator with a certain amount of background noise, key click and hum. I don't think there is much difference between either of my main hammonds, the early 60's RT3 (C3 with 32 note pedalboard) whitecap had a softer sound and more crosstalk between notes, it was what they'd probably call battered. It was a nadge noisy and pretty imperfect. The later C3 I had which had the red caps was a lot cleaner, it was less noisy, but still was non-digitaly. It was similar, but brighter, brighter percussion and brighter chorus, the whole thing was cleaner. It was much of a muchness, more like recording quality.The Nord is in a similar ballpark, but without the crosstalk of the early one.The speakers were what made the difference, I used to swap tubes around and had a 61 PR40 which was more grunty and raw than the later ""quiet"" one. All of it was understressed and the only thing muffling the clarity (which was almost rude through headphones) was the 6k rolloff. The leslies didn't have this and were noisy. I had a 145 and a 147. Much of a muchness and the same amplifiers. I played around with the tubes in them and got a variety of different results, mainly with the harshness of the overdrive. The 145 was noticably more ""punchy"" soundwise, almost boxy.From listening to both organs (dirty whitecap and clean redcap) through headphones, they are a much of a muchness, what it boils down to is the boxyness, the quality of overdrive and the choppiness of the leslie miking.The short answer is to run the nord through a leslie and I doubt that a lot of people would be able to tell the difference. The EX88 has the boxiness of the 145 in the leslie simulator, you hit the button and it goes boxy and compact, the rotary is quite subtle and quite subtle, a real leslie is a lot more ""dynamic"".I can only assume that the C1 and C2 have EQ and noise to give you the difference between a clean late organ and a dirty noisy one, however, it's a small adjustment to a noisy, proper leslie. The Hammond PR40 speaker is a piece of HIFI, the leslie isn't and is pretty rude really. I recapped mine and fitted a set of bottle tubes and it was still noisy and rude.The key difference, if you opened the ""gate"" up full and gave it some beans, by the time you were getting a really sweet overdrive, it was really really really really loud. It's nice to have an overdrive without waking up the whole village.I think the crux of the matter is with the speaker simulation. The overdrive is pretty good, you need to turn it up loud and get that animation, that's what happens when you whack the nord output into a big transistor leslie. I wouldn't bother paying the extra and getting the ""it's making the neighbours windows vibrate"" levels of volume in order to get ""that"" overdrive sound from a valve leslie.However, with the leslie, I used to have about 3 preamp tubes ECC82A's or something and they made the most difference to the sound. I had a sweet one which used to give a lovely overdrive blur.It was all heavy and it was all a hassle. I think a nord organ with a real leslie is probably in the order of getting the job done.Plus, with the synth on the nord stage, you can put a sine wave in place which doesn't fold back on the bottom octave, to give you the old Model A, B, BC, D super bass sound, which rules through a big system.That's what I think about it.

In the dim and distant past, before I had an Electro, I had a chopped Hammond M102, Marshall valve preamp and Sharma rotating speaking cabinet, which was a realistic compromise between a) a tolerable sound b) something that was practical (just) to transport to pub gigs and c) not hacking off the neighbours by having to crank the amp to 11 to get a decent overdrive on it. I stopped all that the minute I got the Electro and have never regretted doing so, no matter how tempted I am to think it would nice to spin real air or pull proper drawbars for a change at some of the larger gigs.I do remember if I cranked the volume on the M102 through this rig, I could hear a faint trebly background tone, which was the sound of the tone generator just running on idle. I wonder if that's what the ""battered"" mode is trying to reproduce.Incidentally, I never got on with the more popular B3 / C3 / A100 Hammonds - I did have an A100 for a few years, and flogged it as I just found the M102 layout easier to handle when changing drawbar settings while keeping my hands level instead of having to lean over the swell manual.

The Canadian distributor said they would look into it but I never got any answer, either positive or negative, since then. They never answered my other emails neither.

I think you are right on both counts. The company is probably not inclined to release its Service Manuals for models which are still in production. But, like you said, I have nothing to loose to ask then directly.By the way, I fully agree with you about the awesome quality of the C2. I have worked with quite a few Hammond clones (the old Korg BX-3, the Roland VK8-M), and while these machines were very good, the C2 is superior to them in every aspect. The only thing I miss, since I use the C2 as my main keyboard to control other synthesizer modules, is some kind of  pitch bend wheel (like the Numa or the VK-88 have), which could come in handy some times. But it isn't a big deal compared to all the beautiful sounds my Nord gives me.Regards, and thanks again",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=10075&sid=8e0126e2b4b28d7a32562263ec59cde3#p10075

I can't get over the single set of drawbars for two manuals!  Whose idea was that? Talk about a marketing ploy!The Nord ""draw-buttons"" take some getting used to, but the U-P-L layout and pre-set function follow the original Hammond idea much better than a single set can.Having had some experience with Hammonds over the years (since about the mid 60's) I cannot believe the tizzy some people work themselves into over the slight differences in clone-wheel organs, or even the tizzy they work themselves into over the differences between the clone-wheels and tone-wheels. I sometimes wonder if all the different clonewheels vary as much as different Hammonds of the same model, or the different Hammond models and the many different amp set-ups.Look, when I play my Nord, it operates in a Hammond like way that I am used to, but more important, the audience reacts to the sound and the playing technique (smear, gliss, shimmer, howl, drone, chording, percussion, big, small, animation etc)  pretty much as they do to a Hammond.  Even, (yes, I know this sounds paradoxical, but it's not if you think about it) and more importantly, if they have never really listened to a Hammond before.  And it weighs 36 lbs.You know, I have my Nord (when it's home) in the same room with my Hammond and Leslie.  I have never A-B'ed them, and I probably never will.  What, exactly, would be the point? I've got much better ways to drive myself crazy.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=9983&sid=8e0126e2b4b28d7a32562263ec59cde3#p9983
139528,13,8e0126e2b4b28d7a32562263ec59cde3,p9179,C1 with subwoofer,1389,jamienewman,2011-11-15T02:05:12+00:00,False,,"Hate to be forum hog, but here's another question:I have both a C1 and the Nord Stage 88.  I've been trying to come up with a single amplifier/speaker configuration that will work well with both boards. I have a pair of JBL Eon 510's that make the piano sound really good,  but they just don't seem to handle the bass output from  the C1 very well.  At the volumes at which I usually run them -- which aren't screaming --  they seem to be working too hard and sound sort of honky and overdriven.  This is a problem since I'm using the C1 mostly on organ trio gigs where I'm playing bass (just keyboard, not pedals).I recently acquired a Motion Sound KP- 500SN, which makes the C1 sound fabulous, and delivers very substantial bass sound. But, despite much tweaking, it makes the acoustic  pianos sound  on the Stage sound crappy -- boxy, clangy, lifeless.  (The EPs and Clavs sound fine).So unless someone can tell me how to make the KP-500SN sound good with Stage, I'm thinking about getting rid of it, and buying a subwoofer to use with one of the JBL's.  (Electro-Voice has an interesting new sub with a 12 inch woofer that weighs only around 35 lbs).Has anyone used a C1 or C2 with this combination -- a single powered speaker  and a powered sub?  If I were to try this, how would I route the C1's output?  Mono out to the powered speaker, with the sub daisy chained to it?  Or could I run one stereo out to the speaker, and the other to the sub?Or, if I decided to run through both JBL's and a sub, what would be the best way to route the C1 output, and to connect the speakers?Sorry to be so long-winded, and to ask questions that are probably quite dumb.  I just play digital keyboards -- I really don't understand them.Thanks to your help.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=9179&sid=8e0126e2b4b28d7a32562263ec59cde3#p9179
