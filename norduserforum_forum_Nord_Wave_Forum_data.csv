I think the Wave 2 is a really logical and well-thought next step in the product line.Here are my thoughts on your comments:Master Clock-Have not tested it, but use it for a number of time-based arpeggiator patches and never noticed any drift.Please let us know the bugs you are experiencing, as I have spend 40-50 hours with the instrument and have not encountered them. I did have a couple of hung notes but not since 1.10.I agree that user presets are not fantastic and probably not meant to be. Getting a unit to market in a certain time frame shortens programming time. I kept about 80 of them and deleted the rest. Even in my Stage 3 I deleted all of them before I started programming patches.  So far I have not used a single factory preset in either instrument.I think the Layer detune settings are excellent.  In fact in my opinion they are the best of any of the six Nord instruments I have had. You have a different experience, though.I also agree that the drive and reverb could be better, but I have the opposite opinion, that the drive is too nuanced and does not affect the sound as much as it does in my NS3. I think the Cathedral reverb is something I would pretty much never use, would prefer two Stage reverbs like the NS 3.-dj",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=131602&sid=646b57feadeb3cede482447215098f13#p131602

Poly glide is nice for the big polysynth stab-type patches among other things.For me it is less about 1 LFO and more that it can only affect one destination at a time. For example on most synths I program a lead that has different amounts of filter and pitch mod on the LFO for a more natural vibrato.

But for those who hit the road most of the time that they turn on a power button, this is an ideal synth for that.My situation is unique because, while I fit into that niche, my current local job doesn't have room for two keyboards. If I were at my previous job, I'd have kept this synth. If I get another, I will probably buy another one. But in my current gig, the NS3 is all I have room for of performance keyboards, of which this is an excellent one.The one feature I would’ve liked is Waveform Mix (Dual Oscillator). I found I couldn’t achieve the results using layers to accurately mix oscillators as effectively as the NS3. Maybe the ratio using two layers instead of a percentage, maybe the Sonics of two layers playing in each other’s space instead of a percentage. Either way, it wouldn’t stop me from buying this board again if my context changes to one where I could use a second. And features like the chorale reverb that no other Nord has are perfect for my application (although some don’t use it), reinforcing that it really does depend on people’s individual uses.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=138992&sid=646b57feadeb3cede482447215098f13#p138992

I also found it to be excellent, very easy to control with a great feel. If they made a waterfall version of that it would probably be my perfect action, as I didn't learn on a piano anyway so not used to heavily weighted keys but can easily control dynamics with a keybed like the KeyLab's. The Nord Wave2, from memory, has a little deeper key travel in comparison but I don't remember having much if any problem adjusting to the key feel.

I thought that the Summit/Peak were the closest you could get to analog with still having the flexibility of digital. I’ve owned a System 8 in the past and could never get over the slight digital edge it had in its emulations. I actually preferred playing the Nord Lead A1 over it. It couldn’t get to the same level of accuracy regarding its emulation, but it just felt more alive almost like it was a produced sound out of the box. I always get that same feeling when I side by side Nord keyboards with Roland and Yamaha flagship workstation synths. The Nord always seems more full and present.I hate a harsh metallic reverb. The Wave 2 cathedral isn’t harsh like that is it? To put it in context, I find Roland reverbs to be metallic and Yamaha Montage/MODX reverb to be pleasant and not harsh.Thanks for the input!

If you are doing recordings into a DAW, you will have plenty of software reverbs which would be applied after tracking.  For live performance, I think the on-board reverb is fine and flexible enough.  If you have a sound man, then he will make the decision if there is to be reverb at all.  Most live rooms are live enough on their own where reverb is not only unnecessary, but can actually worsen the overall sound of the keyboards.-dj",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=140640&sid=646b57feadeb3cede482447215098f13#p140640

Should I just be happy with what the NW2 gives me or would a reverb peddle be worth it???This depends on how important reverb is to your sound. If all you need is a little subtle room ambience then the Nord is fine (I still prefer external gear, but the pedals you mention would be expensive just for that sound.) If you need a wide variety of reverb sounds from typical to crazy, or want more control over the tone than the Nord provides, then I'd certainly get a pedal. The Night Sky is by far the most unique of the ones you listed and while when it first came out  I was not impressed, I heard demos later which have sold me once I can find a decent deal on one. That pedal goes waaaaaayyyy beyond what the Nord will give you, if you want to get experimental, and it also appears to be able to produce some fairly standard reverb sounds when you want something classic. Also, no menus like on the other pedals you mentioned, just knobs, buttons and switches so it would fit well with the Nord's design philosophy.If you use software extensively and don't care about modifying the sounds in real time, you may be better off with VST plugins. I prefer hardware all the way personally but everyone has their own process.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=140657&sid=646b57feadeb3cede482447215098f13#p140657

I tested the Wave as a MIDI controller and found that the velocity response is a lot different than the various other keyboards I've played in that role. There is a wider range of the velocity response that is dedicated to softer velocities on the Nord, which could give the impression of feeling physically heavier as you have to play the keys a lot harder to get the maximum sounds. This is less noticeable on the Wave itself, I can play monosynth runs just fine on it, but with a wide velocity range (I.E. playing rhodes on an external sound module) it is very easy to notice. The Motif XF/Montage's action feels physically heavier to me but the velocity response can be adjusted for a lighter touch, so even though the keys themselves may be heavier with a longer travel they can feel lighter to play.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=140669&sid=646b57feadeb3cede482447215098f13#p140669

Cobalt has 8 voice polyphony, weaker filter, two osc, no samples, no morphing, etc.Morphing is simply a streamlined modulation matrix, which the Cobalt does have.Cobalt technically has more variation in its filter than the Nord due to its various modes. You may find it sonically not as nice; that's a matter of opinion.Cobalt has 3 envelopes, 3 LFO's, greater control over it's effects, more performance control sources to be assigned in the matrix, vintage oscillator drift emulation, a wider variety of analog waveshaping options, a 37-key and module equivalent for those who want a compact setup, etc. It's also far cheaper. I was going to buy one but I found the tone too modern for me, too plastic. But frankly I thought much the same with the Nord's VA side also though it is definitely warmer. I'm not in love with the Cobalt's interface, either. But if you need a synth and not a basic sample player for a low price that is on the modern side as the original poster had mentioned it's hard to beat, and if you don't want the more advanced features they are largely out of sight in shift functions.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=143335&sid=646b57feadeb3cede482447215098f13#p143335

Any thoughts there? If I could get the PX for $2K I’d consider it as an addition to my gear, but I’m probably just feeding my GAS over a real need.There is a video where some guy goes through every single sample on the PX. It is at least an hour long I believe...maybe 1.5 hours... In any case, the 8Dio library is, in my opinion, not very good despite it taking 150gb of space. Nord has some great single velocity samples and many of them sound more realistic than the 8Dio ones.One reason for this is that while many of the 8Dio samples have multiple velocity layers or alternate samples, they are not consistent from note to note and do not give a smooth velocity transition.Here's an example (albeit maybe a subtle one.) Listen to the guitar here, and notice that low F sample has a buzz in it. Almost every single time that key is hit, you can hear that buzz, it's the exact same sample over and over.If I load a similar-sounding Nord guitar, the samples are all clean and consistent across the keyboard.Now, if the 8Dio sample had more layers and RR's that buzz would actually be very realistic as it would only happen occasionally...but there is not enough variation. This carries throughout the PX soundset...the underlying samples in their bare bones form are fine in terms of audio quality...but there aren't enough of them per instrument to sound like anything other than, well, playing samples...if that makes sense.While I've not encountered this personally I've also read reports of loop points in some samples not being smooth (some strings, choirs...) This can be tweaked but one would think that from the factory this should be dialed in.In my opinion, the PX would be better off had the entire 200GB drive been open to customization, rather than just the (still admittedly large) 50GB provided for user data. However the overall workflow is much more like a conventional synth, things are essentially where you expect them to be whereas the Nord required a learning adjustment for me. I'd still take a standard synth layout over the Nord's streamlined one any day of the week as I can dial up the sounds I want much faster. You also have a lot more control over the samples on the PX, so if the goal is experimentation then that machine even with its factory library would give you more sonic opportunities. I also prefer the analog filter on the PX, and the mod matrix is more adjustable than Nord's morphing system (and is still quite easy to use; you really don't need to go deep into menus to set things up at all...just press some buttons and move the knobs/controls you want to assign.) You get extra performance controls (ribbons and a second expression pedal input,) and more options for how the synth responds to your playing (poly glide, glide types, key priority, single/multi triggering options, adjustable unison etc.) Now many of these options are available on the Nord in some way but they are linked to each other.I would say to sum up the Nord would probably cover more ground; the PX would allow you to dial in things more specifically within the areas that it does cover. Whether you would have a use for both depends on what your plans are for each unit. But I would absolutely not buy the PX for the 8Dio samples.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=153315&sid=646b57feadeb3cede482447215098f13#p153315

You could technically get more than 2 sounds at once on the PX if you layered samples, but they would not be splits and their settings would share the same signal path (although you can bypass the filters if needed.) It's all about application.I believe all of the Korg insturments I owned had all RAM spaces.-dj",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=153320&sid=646b57feadeb3cede482447215098f13#p153320

But it actually works in the same way as in the NW2, but only via a little menu and the soft knobs. So you can build ""classic"" 2- or 3-osc analog sounding patches without using the unison function (that automatically introduces a heavy stereo effect).

That's - as with the NW - my wrong approach to the Wave 2.I agree, it will disappointing if people think of the NW2 as a ROMpler type keyboard that contains a highly detailed library of every acoustic instrument under the sun. You can try to use it that way, but you'll find plenty of limitations, and other keyboards do that much better.The Wave 1 and 2 are better thought of as synths that can use sample content as oscillators. Just try colleting a bunch of random audio clips and load them in to see what sort of results you get. It takes some time and work, but it will pay off. For every sample I have tried and kept, there are usually 3 or 4 others that just didn't sound good. It's sort of like panning for gold. A lot of my favorites are very small samples that are stretched across the whole keyboard range. Those take up very little storage space, so 1 GB starts to look huge from that perspective.There are lots of people that revere the old Roland D-50 for its wide range of unique sounds. That synth used 4 partials (layers) that are either comprised of traditional synthesis or samples (with an extremely small amount of sample ROM).

For example I built a (surprisingly very playable!) piano on the NW2 the other day, with 2 sampled velocity layers. It was about 150MB of samples and Nord compressed them down to like 21 MB which is crazy! Yeah it would have been nice if they included at least 2 GB (I mean, the piano section in other boards has that much memory anyway) But you can get a lot out of the space it does have.Using the Wave as a D50 is a great idea and it would be really interesting to hear some patches made in that context.I've had an interesting experience with this synth over the course of its production, having owned it multiple times, and always ending up selling or trading for something else...but then always coming back to it. There are design choices that frustrate me, and yet it really does cover the majority of sounds you'd need live or in the studio. For deeper synthesis or huge multisampled instruments I have the Prophet X. The Wave will sit above it, covering a wide variety of sounds where the extra details in the PX are not relevant. Plus there are some things the Nord simply does better (FM, supersaw-type sounds, etc) and the layering options are more flexible on the W2 with greater polyphony.For situations that are primarily focused on organ, piano, rhodes etc I have another board for that.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=173758&sid=646b57feadeb3cede482447215098f13#p173758

This is I'm sure Clavia overly under-design philosophy.How are you even supposed to program interesting sounds? They should have at least made the single LFO push and hold button assignable to any parameter like when you are assigning the mod wheel, but even then, one LFO per slot is very limited.I guess they decided to reduce it to essentially, a .wav player, because synth sounds will sound very canned and predictable from one user to the next.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=127050&sid=646b57feadeb3cede482447215098f13#p127050

However, there are plenty of people out there that still buy hardware and see the benefit in convenience and the tactile nature of knobs for programming. The great thing is how completely integrated it is with my patches, which has modernized my P6. I've owned plenty of pieces of auxiliary hardware that work great, albeit within their own ecosystem that doesn't play well with others. I've also bought plenty of wonky software that weresupposedto work with specific hardware, yet failed at even that task. Steve has tailored the LFE to integrate perfectly with specific synths and it simply works as advertised.Now I'm not Steve's PR guy, I'm simply a paying customer. I've been complaining to anyone who would listen about how insane it is that DSI/Sequential still haven't learned the obvious importance that categories serve for sorting through the massive amounts of presets available on their machines. I fully realize that there are librarian programs for that, but I'm sick of dealing with them. At the end of the day, the less I interact with the computer while in music mode, the more enjoyable I personally find it. Fortunately Steve added categories for the LFE with an update. When I pointed out that there was no ""strings"" category in an email, he swiftly got back to me within the hour with an updated firmware that added said category, even more impressive considering he's in a drastically different timezone.Why I'm writing all this is purely for a selfish reason. I was one of the people that was initially harsh on the Wave 2 for the lack of modulation options. Problem is I started to really listen to some of the sounds coming from Nord synths and soon realized why many folks out there love them. I now have a Wave 2 on pre-order and I'm hoping there's enough interest for Steve to add support for it in the expectation that it will do as much for my Wave 2 as it has for my P6. Again, it's simple and it works, which was, at least from my outsider's view, a large reason why I thought certain users gravitate towards Nord.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=129274&sid=646b57feadeb3cede482447215098f13#p129274

Now that I have also invested in a NS4, no regrets so far.To summarize, here is how I saw both regarding their own strengths.I see the A1 as a real 4 part multitimbral synth, knowing that each layer can be routed to an individual output. The real strength of that synth (apart its tremendous simplicity to program) lies within its oscillators configurations (detune, mix, and so on...), and with the possibility to modulate the digital waveforms (and I also like the formants) which can allow for beautiful evolving digital pads, while keeping a sort of analog warmth that I did not find on the Wave 2. 1 layer can already offer a massive sound. The filter drive has a beautiful natural sound to my ears.The Wave 2 on the other hand, I see it more as a monotimbral synth, with 4 ""partials"" (that can use samples, which is the biggest difference with the A1) that are meant to be blended together to one output (no individual out on this synth anyway). It remind me a bit of a JD800 (yes, I'm that old). Of course, you can also see it as a bi-timbral dual oscillator synth. I often needed at least 2 layers to reach the sound I wanted.To my ears, the sound is more ""chirurgical"" than the A1 (same remark as when comparing the NS3 vs NS4 by the way), more ""precise"", you loose a bit of that ""analog warmth"" of the A1 and a bit of punch as well. The effects are superb (reverb is clearly a step above the A1) and the arpegiator is a bit more developed on this keyboard. Too bad the unison on samples (that can be found on the NS4) was not implemented.The loss of Digital Wavetable modulation (and the formant waves) was not really compensated by samples (you can't modulate them a lot anyway) or the FM, albeit being clearly more capable than the A1.I would say that a Wave 2 would be a great complement to a Nord Stage 3 (or even a 2/2EX), and if you have a Stage 4, the A1 is still a great keeper.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=183335&sid=646b57feadeb3cede482447215098f13#p183335

If there's a circuit error (e.g., a failed LED), it can disrupt normal behaviour for other LEDs connected to that line.I suspect that the LED that no longer functions failed short-circuit and shares a Line with your OSC CNTRL LED causing its misbehaviour.It likely needs repair.

We need more peace in this worldand I would like to say something to this issue that maybe could be interessting...In general, I´m afraid no firmware-update will solve this Oscilator issue, since the WAVE2 just don´t offer this possibility. But miracles happen again and again and the latest STAGE4-Firmware upgrade increases its WAVE2 48-polyphony to 56 without any hardware changes. So just let the guys at Clavia work on it - I trust in their Product-Care (otherwise i had' nt bought their product)...Well - I don´t have the WAVE2 - justthe stage4 with the little brother in.I found the SAW-Sounds in all a little thin and checked the Stage3 with its A1 Synth, that offers me the SAW-Sound I like. There IS surely a difference when using the WAVE2, so it offers its own specific sound, that leaks a bit with the Super- oder Detuned-SAW. But however - with its weaknesses it also has strengths. To me the digital touch is clearer (more useful), while the ""analog"" warmth is poorer (but Unisono and FX helps). I tried to reproduce ""may SAW-SOUNDS"" with 2 Parts and different Unisono-Settings plus some detuning via Vibe or Chorus FX. The Result was a new and special Saw-Sound that I really like today and that I won´t like to miss, but not the one I intended.What I like to say is, that the WAVE2 maybe does not all and maybe not what you´re looking for, but if you tweak around a bit, you come closeand in the end a good own Sample could solve the missing basic sound. Give it a chance...I had the Stage3, Stage4, Electro5 and Electro6 here for testing (for any reason...) and I have to say, that all these different Models / Generation have their own characteristics, even if we´re talking about a mass production PBX. It is surely not CLAVIAs intention, to build different models, that do the same. I would say, even the different generations have their own characteristics (what i appreciate...) As it comes down to own just one model, the final point is: like it or don’t like it. You will not make the toaster brew some coffee and if the WAVE does not offer YOUR SAW-Sound, just replace it against an A1 or something! Life is to short, to use the wrong Keyboard - maybe your challenge to find YOUR perfect key has not come to an end yet...With that, I found this video of Brother Marc interesting and helpful for this issue - maybe you find some help in too:",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=177039&sid=646b57feadeb3cede482447215098f13#p177039

Genuinely curious what you find lacking in the oscillator section. I've had several complaints regarding the design before (mostly regarding LFO's) but I'm interested in understanding what you cannot obtain with the Wave which you can from the other models.The only thing I can think of is that if you need to layer or split 4 different sounds, you can't if you need to use up more than one layer on just one of them. And, of course, the vibrato does not sync up across multiple layers. But if what you are describing is not relating to either of those scenarios I am quite confused.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=177058&sid=646b57feadeb3cede482447215098f13#p177058

We need more peace in this worldand I would like to say something to this issue that maybe could be interessting...In general, I´m afraid no firmware-update will solve this Oscilator issue, since the WAVE2 just don´t offer this possibility. But miracles happen again and again and the latest STAGE4-Firmware upgrade increases its WAVE2 48-polyphony to 56 without any hardware changes. So just let the guys at Clavia work on it - I trust in their Product-Care (otherwise i had' nt bought their product)...Well - I don´t have the WAVE2 - justthe stage4 with the little brother in.I found the SAW-Sounds in all a little thin and checked the Stage3 with its A1 Synth, that offers me the SAW-Sound I like. There IS surely a difference when using the WAVE2, so it offers its own specific sound, that leaks a bit with the Super- oder Detuned-SAW. But however - with its weaknesses it also has strengths. To me the digital touch is clearer (more useful), while the ""analog"" warmth is poorer (but Unisono and FX helps). I tried to reproduce ""may SAW-SOUNDS"" with 2 Parts and different Unisono-Settings plus some detuning via Vibe or Chorus FX. The Result was a new and special Saw-Sound that I really like today and that I won´t like to miss, but not the one I intended.What I like to say is, that the WAVE2 maybe does not all and maybe not what you´re looking for, but if you tweak around a bit, you come closeand in the end a good own Sample could solve the missing basic sound. Give it a chance...I had the Stage3, Stage4, Electro5 and Electro6 here for testing (for any reason...) and I have to say, that all these different Models / Generation have their own characteristics, even if we´re talking about a mass production PBX. It is surely not CLAVIAs intention, to build different models, that do the same. I would say, even the different generations have their own characteristics (what i appreciate...) As it comes down to own just one model, the final point is: like it or don’t like it. You will not make the toaster brew some coffee and if the WAVE does not offer YOUR SAW-Sound, just replace it against an A1 or something! Life is to short, to use the wrong Keyboard - maybe your challenge to find YOUR perfect key has not come to an end yet...With that, I found this video of Brother Marc interesting and helpful for this issue - maybe you find some help in too:Hi Mac,Thank you for your response.I appreciate the calm atmosphere in this forum, as we are all here to help each other and share our knowledge.To clarify, my previous response was intended to be constructive. I wanted to emphasize that we are here to share ideas rather than create divisions. I noticed that some responses focused more on personal experiences with the Nord Wave 2 rather than engaging with the idea I proposed, which was dismissed as not useful, when in fact it is an idea that would benefit everyone.As a professional sound designer, I chose the Nord Wave 2 for my work and thought it would be useful to have the ability to configure the slots similarly to the A1. This proposal comes from my experience with this synth, which I am excited about, and I obviously have many other synths as well. It is intended to enhance our collective understanding and use.I believe that having configurations for the oscillators in the Nord Wave 2 could be a valuable addition for everyone, as it is fundamental for any synth sound. Rather than focusing on the current setup or trying to give me a lesson on how to find a workaround (I find it quite amusing that someone try explaining to me how to configure two slots to achieve two oscillators), I think we could hope for additions that could benefit all users.The Nord Stage 4 demonstrates that two-oscillator configurations on the same octave are indeed possible, and I believe we could hope for a solution that incorporates this functionality in the Nord Wave 2 as well. It already exists; we would just need to add a semitone control to adjust the tuning of the second oscillator.Thank you for considering my thoughts. I hope for future discussions focused on how can improve our tools rather than ending up lecturing each other on unrequested topics",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=177082&sid=646b57feadeb3cede482447215098f13#p177082

Is this possible?For background, I'm a keys player and I'm on the lookout of a 61 key keyboard I can travel with (I'm frequently going back and forth between 2 countries) that I can play piano on and layer up some great sounds and possibly use in combination with synths. Piano and pads with some mono/polysynth goodness thrown in is my usual fair. This has led me to consider a handful of 61 key (can't be more cuz 61's can be taken into the flight cabin) kbds such as Electro 5/6, Wave 2, Hammond SK Pro, YC61, and Vox Continental 61. With the Rev2, controlling it with aftertouch is highly desirable, hence the Wave2 interest.

By means insufficient : I literally need to hammer the Wave 2 keys to barely reach the max velocity of the controlled module. I tried with several other modules (Volcas, other synths) and the same thin happens. This issue nevers happened to me with my previous boards (Motif ES) or MIDI controller (Keystep 37), velocity curves were always nicely gaged.I did a bit of searching, this seems to be a known problem across Nord keyboard. I was apparently solved on the NS3 with firmware 2.60, but noboby seems to find a solution for the Wave 2.Any experience to share on your respective setups ? How does velocity respond when triggering your OB3 for instance ?Besides, is there a way to assign any control knobs of the Wave 2 to control i.e. cut-off / resonance / anything else on the slave module ?Thanks a lot, looking forward !",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=180062&sid=646b57feadeb3cede482447215098f13#p180062

Indeed, the usual problem is, that the slave unit must be programmable CC- and PC-wise. I am still kind of a MIDI noob in general and this forces me to get out of my confort zone ah ah.Even the octave +/- button on the Wave 2 won't control the slave unit accordingly, without changing 3 parameters in the MIDI menu of the Wave 2, I don't get why Nord made it so complicated with this synth - which is awesome in many other ways.I miss the easy Yamaha MIDI implementation from my ES7 sometimes, but well.Quick update back to velocity issue of the Wave 2 I mentioned above : Mark from My Keys To Music gave me the way and recommended to use a Midihub box (in this instance from blokas.io) as middle man between the Wave 2 and the slave unit. This little MIDI box has - among others - a velocity filter allowing you to lower of increase by percentage, like an amplifier of sort. This is quite an inexpensive fix, and this box can do a lot more and bend MIDI messages in a ton of ways.I ended up doing the same via a RK-008 from Retrokits, which can do the same velocity-wise. This is the way if you don't want to use a DAW to patch this issue.I hope this can help someone else !",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=180267&sid=646b57feadeb3cede482447215098f13#p180267

Thanks a lot for sharing. I would say that out of all of the Nord demonstrators he's my favourite for sure - and I'd guess many players would be in agreeance with me here.So, from what you're sayin' on the Wave 2 you can have two samples loaded at once? Or do you mean it's a synth sound combined with a sampled sound, please?With the utmost greatest respect, I wanted you ask you, please: is Matthew blind?

In this case it is at least one of the brass samples mentioned above and at least one analog synth brass (probably a preset analog patch.)

These were always updated more or less every 3 years, at least until covid, wars, inflation etc disrupted everything in the last few years. Considering that the Electro 6 is now way behind schedule, it's an easy guess that we'll see an Electro 7 rather soon.The other lines have much longer product cycles, and it doesn't look like there is a regular upgrade plan: they simply stay in production as long as they sell, and then they are replaced by a new version or just discontinued.So I agree that a new Wave is probably not coming for a good while, if ever. After all, the Wave 2 arrived 13 years after the original...and in between there were 8 years without any Wave at all in Nord's portfolio.If you think the Wave 2 suits your needs, you better get one now.

For refence waveform i mostly used wavetable 1 EPiano 1 which is identical to wavetable E1 in Nord Lead A1 and P1 in Nord Lead 4.Nord Lead A1 and Nord Lead 4 both got that little extra in fundemental tone.Is it a problem, nah probably not but if you struggle to create a patch from your A1 or NL4 on your Nord Wave 2 then maybe compensate with a little low end EQ.The quick fix on Nord Wave 2 is to group all 4 layers use the EQ at around 222 Hz and a 4-6dB gain.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=140063&sid=646b57feadeb3cede482447215098f13#p140063

So this instead points to the phase of the Wave 2 saw being flipped (to shark fin). The NL1 has a regular sawtooth, after that, they flipped the wave phase and the effect of this is for there to be less audible bass, even when the spectra look identical. This is a psychoacoustic effect due to physical push-pull of speaker cones. In the DAW it makes no difference, but to your ears, it does. I have confirmed this with the NL1 vs Wave 1. The spectra on the two do not look the same (NL1 has more high frequency content) but in terms of bass the NL1 sounds slightly ""bassier"" until you flip the phase on the Wave 1 signal, then they sound equally bassy.From the above observations it sounds like they flipped the wave back to normal on the A1/NL4.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=178807&sid=646b57feadeb3cede482447215098f13#p178807

This way I don't need to reorganize my patches saved on the Prophet, as long as the program change numbers are correctly set on my Fantom I can use the setlist function on that synth and get the right sounds from Prophet every time.But who wants to tell me what Program Change value will make my Nord Wave 2 switch to Bank D, program 42? The answer is most obviously not LSB 3, PC 41, like it would be on more MIDI-friendly devices. The correct answer is actually LSB 0, PC 91. How very nice.Sooo I spent a little while pondering this with GPT 4o and after a while there was a mathemathical formula for calculating the right number.After getting the formula, I used Grimoire to produce a simple browser based calculator.Now if I wish to have the correct LSB and PC numbers for my master controller, I input the Bank and patch number to this calculator and it will give me the correct PC number to use. In Wave 2, banks A–E are accessed via LSB 0, banks F-J LSB 1 and K-P LSB 2.So for example, for program 51 on bank N, this calculator will output LSB 2, PC 95. I input these on my Fantom-07, and the sounds will switch correctly on both devices. Same applies when using forScore, MobileSheets, Gig Performer or any controller.This tool has sped up my workflow quite a bit today. Feel free to try it out. (Unfortunately, bank P values start going above the MIDI PC maximum, so this will only work between banks A–O, but that's plenty enough of banks for me)https://wave2-pc-calculator.netlify.app/Näyttökuva 2024-10-07 kello 18.27.02.png (54.88 KiB) Viewed 4993 times",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=178344&sid=646b57feadeb3cede482447215098f13#p178344

Nice presentation of the problem, so there's one point that can be seen directly: Global MIDI channel is set to off - but it's probably that channel that will send PC messages. But it's not as easy as switching that to on.You may need to understand that MIDI is something really basic. Only small portion of the standard is plug&play. The rest is a type of communication standard that only provides possibilities, not solutions.What the Wave2 sends is only a message about the new Wave2 program selected on the panel. Not its name, just a numeric value consisting of three variables: 1x program change, 2x bank select. I have no idea how you can get Omnisphere to interpret this in the right manner - somehow, you'll need to translate this into the corresponding Omnisphere preset address, if it's not absolutely the same. But banks on Omnisphere aren't necessarily organised the same way program banks are in the Nord.The solution may be what maxpiano advised.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=176993&sid=646b57feadeb3cede482447215098f13#p176993

This will only work for the main LFO, not the vibrato one. Just sync the LFO to master clock and adjust the tempo accordingly. You may need to experiment with tapping different tempos in to fine tune the speed, but once this is done, the LFO never drifts out of sync if the layers are grouped. Since each patch can have its own tempo, this essentially takes care of the problem, unless you have a patch where you want to adjust the LFO speed smoothly with a morph source.

When you turn on the instrument and play it works as it should, however I've found after making some new patches and coming back to a saved one, the main LFO is out of sync. As you can hear, the layers are grouped and move together as the speed is changed, however their cycles in the LFO are clearly not in the same place, so that even with a normal vibrato rate the sound is not correct.The good news is this is fixable by power cycling but it's annoying if it were ever to happen in a live performance...EDIT: I figured out a solution. This will only work for the main LFO, not the vibrato one. Just sync the LFO to master clock and adjust the tempo accordingly. You may need to experiment with tapping different tempos in to fine tune the speed, but once this is done, the LFO never drifts out of sync if the layers are grouped. Since each patch can have its own tempo, this essentially takes care of the problem, unless you have a patch where you want to adjust the LFO speed smoothly with a morph source. Aside from that, this will work.I think the problem lies precisely in the use of vibrato.Certainly, you can sync the main LFO, but since it's the only one, does it make sense to ""waste"" it to use it as vibrato when there's an LFO specifically designed for that function?Nord should address this issue and not just this one.The Nord Wave 2 needs to become a truly competitive synth by ensuring that what's already in the instrument works at 100%",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=174667&sid=646b57feadeb3cede482447215098f13#p174667

But the dedicated vibrato LFO not working across layers is frustrating and I cannot imagine why Nord thought the current situation was logical, surely they have tested a patch with more than one layer that has vibrato on it...For me personally, because I am pairing this with a Prophet X, I have my deeper bases covered. However if someone only wanted to use one synth this has some strange limitations for sure...

But as mentioned, you already have a very powerful synthesizer so you probably won't use much the synth section of the Stage. In this case, the Electro series would be the best pairing and even an old Electro 4 would complement the Wave2 perfectly.Or you could look for cheaper stage pianos from other brands: for piano sounds and actions, even a used Yamaha P-45 or Kawai ES-110 can be great (those won't give you organ, though).Anyway, before buying additional keyboards or returning your NW2, I'd suggest to do a deep dive in the available sounds, as DJkeys suggested.You will find the samples very ""static"" which is normal because they are mono-layer samples (that is, non velocity sensitive). But you can add dynamics by linking the filter and amp envelope to velocity: that single action will make the samples much more alive and usable.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=176585&sid=57e67d3f54bc9095f80cb59a9ac3434f#p176585

In order to do that, I would normally use the octave shift buttons of a keyboard.In the Nord Wave 2, I have set the octave shift to global, but it still doesnt work! The only way I got it to work is when I set the global channel to 0  in the midi/systems menu and define a channel for each layer separatly (which seems to be stored in the patch), and then set the octave shift to global. But this only works as long as I don't change a patch... Changing the patch means losing the setting of the global octave shift and also the channel definitions for the layer, but the setting of the 'global channel 0' stays. So the synth doesn't send any octave shifted notes to the DAW.Thank you for any help!Cheers!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=130880&sid=57e67d3f54bc9095f80cb59a9ac3434f#p130880

The presets were 50/50 and I was disappointed with some of the ways the programming of the synth was simplified.I get it now. The simplification w/regards to modulation and oscillator setup opens my creativity up to exploring other ways of adding texture and dynamics to my patches. The workflow on the Wave 2 also encourages me to use the FX section as an integral part of the patch as opposed to a bit of color you throw on after the meat of the patch is done. Velocity morphs along with the 4 part mixer, I think, are the real killer apps on this synth. Making each patch feel organic and alive.Finally, the samples started to make more sense. I now treat them as pseudo-oscillators that set the initial timbre of the patch and then work with drive, filter fm and resonance to bring out otherworldy characteristics from the original sample.Overall, the brilliance of this synth is hard to grasp at first blush.

With OSC CTRL assigned to morph wheel for 1 layer and morph pedal for another layer I was then able to assign Ribn sliders to those CC #s for mod wheel and expression pedal.

You can easily create dual oscillator sounds by either using the various multi saws or by stacking multiple slots and detuning them.My setup is slightly different; it will be an NS4 Compact on the bottom when I buy one, and then a Sequential Prophet X on top which I already have. This gives me way more flexibility than 2 Nords with the same engine and samples. However, the Prophet is a deeper machine, and unless you take the time to create custom samples (the factory library is garbage,) it wouldn't be a strong recommendation. That keyboard requires a lot of work to get its best...but once the work is done I've been able to set up instruments that play like a high-end VST with many articulations etc. And the VA synth side is very powerful, it's an awesome performance instrument too with the wheels, aftertouch, pedals and 2 ribbons that you can assign to anything.

The backup file is simply an (uncompressed) zip file of theSamp LibandProgrampartitions, with an additional file storing the settings of the Wave. Nothing exciting there.Figuring out how to extract specific types of data from thenwpfiles is the time consuming part. For now I've figured out how the settings regarding the oscillators in slot A and B are stored. I now have a simple utility that prints information about the oscillators in a program.

Some kind of spreadsheet? Maybe some HTML document with clickable links?Apart from presenting the data I'm currently extracting in a more user-friendly format, I'm also interested in the following:- for each sample, list which programs make use of it- specifically highlight unused samples- generate textual versions of programs, that could be used to implement (some of) these programs on an NS2 (this would bea lotof additional work)- figure out what Wave programs can be implemented on the NS2 and have the program provide feedback on what can and cannot be done on the NS2 (there may be ways to approximate specific Wave settings on the NS2)It would also be interesting to make a controller plugin (VST/AU) for the Wave, like Johannes has done with the NS (or was that NS2?). It would be even cooler if that plugin could load sounds fromnwbornwpfiles and send those via MIDI to the Wave (excluding samples, those would already need to be present).This little endeavor has already taken up more hours than intended and I may just release it as it is once the thing generates some usable output. It is currently written in C; a rewrite to Java might make sense.Btw. my reason for doing this is that I've been thinking about replacing my Roland Fantom G6 and my Wave with an NS2. However, if I were to do that, I would first want to know what I would be loosing in the process.

However, using the tempo knob (and maybe also the tap tempo button, I haven't tried that) does allow you to set intermediate steps even though the display will not show them. It looks like you can even go slower than 2.26 sec. Maybe tempo can be controlled via 14-bit MIDI messages, I haven't tried that either (the MIDI implementation chart in the manual does not show it as an option).Code:Select allName: ""Forst MW      SJ""

However, for a VST/AU/RTAS plugin something like JUCE (as used by Ctrlr for example) would be more appropriate, which would mean developing in C++. Of course, developing (and supporting!) a plugin like that (from scratch) easily takes upwards of 300 man-hours.

                int tempo = tempos[tempoval >> 9];

                // it. Using MIDI only the 7 MSB bits can be modified. However, using the the knob on
                // the synth intermediate values can be dialed in, but it is doubtful it can make much
                // use of the 512 (9-bit) steps between 'MIDI' values. Additionally, the display shows
                // the tempo based on the 7 MSB bits. The question is: do the 9 LSB bits actually do
                // something? Is 0x2750 faster than 0x2700 or does it result in the same tempo? Also,
                // Are values higher than the highest MIDI value (127, which is shown as 64ms) faster
                // than 64ms or not?!
                if (tempo >= 1000)
                {
                        printf(""    Tempo: %.2f s\n"", tempo / 1000.0f);

For some parameters it doesn't behave as expected. For instance: If I set semi tones to +12, and the wheel morph on semi tones to +24, full wheel position will add a octave as expected. But if I then turn the semi tones knob (not in morph mode) to +24, I would expect to cancel the morph. This isn't happening, the +12 semintones morph is kept, so full wheel still gives one octave. OK, but repeating the same procedure, but with -12 semitones initially, -24 semitones for the wheel morph and finally setting the semintones to -24, the morph if effectively canceledIn the implementation, I assume not to go out of scale with morphing, but this is at least in one case (add one octave) an incorrect assumption.The mapping from parameter value (mostly a 7 bit value) has to be mapped to the values shown in the display. This is done with tables. However I haven't been able to map all values for all parameters, so for some values the display will show something like ""? (-7.0 .. -6.7)"", because I don't know which of the two values the display will show. I will try to improve this further, but some values seems to be very difficult (impossible?) to dial inThe last last two bytes in the nwp file contains a checksum. Initially, I decided not to care for this (though it should be included if the file verification should it be perfect). But now I will try to find out what is is, so I can make some reverse enginering for the missing parameter mappings (previous pin).

Is yours?,2478,MonoPoly307,2023-10-08T08:57:56+00:00,False,,"Hi guysI've received my new Nord Wave 2 this week - loving it so far, it's a versatile synth and I'm enjoying having a Nord synth with 5 octaves (I previously had a Wave 1).I've noticed a bit of a manufacturing defect and was wondering if this is normal.On my Wave 2, the gap at the front of the keys, before the black panel at the front, is smaller on the left side than the right side. It makes the whole keyboard look a little out of alignment. The difference isn't huge, but it's enough to see clearly while playing the instrument.These photos don't do the difference justice, but may give you an idea of what I'm referring to.I went to another music store and their demo unit was even more out of alignment, so I'm wondering if this is the norm for the Wave 2? If you have a Wave 2, I'd love to know if your keyboard has this problem.Cheers and thanks!MikeIMG_4407.jpeg (442.79 KiB) Viewed 2313 timesIMG_4406.jpeg (317.03 KiB) Viewed 2313 times",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=169396&sid=57e67d3f54bc9095f80cb59a9ac3434f#p169396

In fact the tension on pianostrings has a great impact on their partial tones. The higher the tension, the more brilliant it sounds an the the higher the inharmonicity.

While you may get lucky and not damage anything with a too-large fuse, it's never a good idea to go higher than rated - the circuit may already be at the edge of tolerance there, so you run the risk of damaging something expensive in the unfortunate case of an internal short, a power surge, or other low-probability-but-high-damage-potential cases.

I've found some related topics on this forum (here,hereandhere), but none of them seems to have been solved... I have sent a message to the Nord Technical Support, hoping to get an answer.In case some of you might have a solution or ideafor me, I copied below the message that I sent to the Technical Support.Many thanks anyways !The message sent to technical support:Hello,I have contacted you earlier for a problem of factory restore stuck in progress. It seems that my problem was bigger than that. I have stopped the program while running (there was no other choice). Then I have made other tests that I describe below. My conclusion is that my Nord Wave is having software issues that are far beyond my abilities, and that the only way to have it working again would be to send it to a professional repair center. Here are the tests I made, anyway:- When I turn on the Nord Wave keyboard, it seems to have lost the OS update that I did before turning it off.- When turned on, the Nord Wave digital screen shows successively these three messages:1. ""Nord WaveHwRev 1.0-2.0""2. ""Nord WaveInvalid CAB hdr""3. ""Update modeready""- Then, when I connect the Nord Wave to my MacBook Air through usb, and open the file ""Update Nord Wave OS v2.14.dmg"", I get this message: ""Connected, but unable to get TP version and build."". I can however continue and press ""Update"", which runs successfully.- I can then open Nord Sound Manager. There, I see that ""Samp Lib"", ""Program"", and ""SWave"" are empty, except for two samples that I was able to download to the keyboard earlier.- With my first early try to do a full restore, I got stuck in the process, with estimated time going up with no limitation (it got up to more than 5000 minutes, after 4 or 5 hours running the restore…). Therefore, I tried to add factory samples one by one. I was able to add ""FndJazzPlectrum_Direct_CLv4.nsmp"", ""FndJazz Finger_Dir _STv4.nsmp"", ""PersianSantur__ste PSv4.nsmp"", ""CathedralOrgan5__ste SRv4.nsmp"", one by one, and then when I tried adding another sample ""CathedralOrgan3__ste SRv4.nsmp"", I got stuck again in the process. The estimated time showed on the Nord Sound Manager kept increasing starting at 2 minutes and then going to 3, 4, 5... 9, 10 minutes without stopping. Both the Nord Sound Manager and the Nord Wave digital panel were showing the message ""Cleaning..."" when this happened. When the estimated time reached 15 minutes and I was still stuck in progress, I decided to close Nord Sound Manager. When reopening, I found only two samples, one Fender Jazz Dir and one Persian Santur, and two other samples that were corrupted. I decided to erase them, but the Nord Sound Manager closed unexpectedly. When I reopened it, I had three valid samples and not two, plus one invalid sample that I could erase...- I decided to stop there with the Nord Sound Manager and disconnect the usb port. I could then see that my Nord Wave seemed to be working, although there were no program, no waves, AND no samples (while I thought I successfully added at least two). All the buttons and knobs seem to be functionning. I could play a little bit with some simple triangular or square oscillators + effects. However that is all my Nord Wave could do.- I tried to store a program on my Nord Wave, and the digital screen said:""Failed to store!Errore code: 12""- I turned my Nord Wave off. When turned on back again, it showed these messages:1. ""Nord WaveHwRev 1.0-2.0""2. ""Nord WaveInvalid OS""3. ""Update modeready""I have now decided to stop my experiments. I hope that you can help me finding a skillful person who could restore my Nord Wave keyboard to the way it was, and that I'll have a wonderful time playing it again.Many thanks in advance for your help.Have a wonderful day,",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=154304&sid=57e67d3f54bc9095f80cb59a9ac3434f#p154304

Is it preferable to use the L/R output jacks vs. the stereo headphone jack (would be broken out to L/R into the interface)?

I'm considering running an external synth but not sure if routing through the Wave 2's external in would result in perceivable poorer audio quality vs. routing directly to the audio interface.Again - my studio is small and I'm not running long cables.

I don't have a Wave 2, but maybe you can get better answers from someone more knowledgeable than me if you give a specific sound(s) on a particular song you're trying to cover.JMJ is a synth guru and pretty much dedicated his entire life making his own patches on probably at least a hundred different synths.

There are dedicated LEDs for this on the Stage 4 but it seems this could conceivably be added to the Wave 2 as a SHIFT function as it's the same synth engine (even if the only visual feedback might be on an OLED display).I know this can be roughly accomplished by carefully playing chord tones in the right order, but to make things easier I'd love to see this on the NW2.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=161848&sid=e5a7d857bf61362c24a290976679db22#p161848

What I ideally wanted was to be able to use the Stage 3 keyboard to control some Wave 2 layers via MIDI, and the Wave 2's own keyboard to control others, but it doesn't look like that's currently possible.If the Global Channel is set to OFF, then each layer can receive on its own MIDI channel, and the channel for each layer is stored per program. Unfortunately, there are 2 huge shortcomings with this mode:1.  Each layer must have a different MIDI channel - you can't have multiple layers respond to the same MIDI channel. If 2 or more layers have the same MIDI channel, then only the lowest layer sounds. For example, if I set Layer A and Layer B to MIDI channel 8, then only Layer A responds to MIDI data on channel 8. There is a hint on the display, because the MIDI channel for Layer B appears in brackets as (8).2. Program Change messages are only received on the Global Channel, so you can't change the Wave 2 program from the Stage 3 in this mode.If the Global Channel is set to a value, then each layer can still receive its own MIDI channel, but the channels for each layer are now global (i.e. they can't be changed with different programs). The Wave 2 also responds to Program Change and MIDI data on the Global Channel, and this plays all the layers which are active (i.e. the same as if you were playing the Wave 2's own keyboard).This means if you want to play some layers on the Wave 2 from an external keyboard especially the Stage 3, the options are very limited.  You can basically either play only the active layers on the Wave 2 global channel, or play only one layer from the Stage 3 and the other 3 layers from the Wave 2's keyboard.It would be great if either:- Multiple layers on the Wave 2 could receive MIDI data on the same layer channel, and / or- The Wave 2 could respond to program changes on one of the layer MIDI channels.  Then you could at least use both Stage 3 external sections to control 2 layers on the Wave 2 from the Stage 3.- The MIDI channel for each layer was always stored per program regardless of Global Channel setting.There's maybe a bit more flexibility if you use splits on either the Wave 2 or Stage 3 external section to divide up the keyboard. Anything more complex than this is going to need some kind of MIDI processor (rechannelizer?) to turn one channel output from the Stage 3 external section to 4 channels in parallel to operate different layers of the Wave 2.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=134576&sid=e5a7d857bf61362c24a290976679db22#p134576

So nothing should change for the filter if you put a computer interface or another keyboard on the MIDI-in side.Yes that Miditech devicehttps://miditech.de/en/portfolio/midi-thru-4-filter/is powered by MIDI IN and as you say (and as I also replied to the OP) NW2 has a voltage lower than nominal, otoh it can be that the computer interface MIDI IN is more ""sensitive"" (i.e. works with 3.3V or lower) than the MIDI IN of the Roland VT4 and this explains why it works in one case but not the other.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=159707&sid=e5a7d857bf61362c24a290976679db22#p159707

MIDI that enters the Nord Wave 2 on the Global MIDI channel will play all the Layers that are active.LAYER MIDI CHANNELSUse the individual Layer MIDI channels on the Nord Wave 2 for individual control of each Layer, both for notes and for panel parameters. Thiscan for example be used in a multitimbral setup, controlling 4 individual sound sources from a sequencer.(A Layer does not have to be active in a Program to receive MIDI, it will always respond to incoming MIDI on its MIDI Channel. This makes it possible to control selected Layers from the keyboard, and other Layers from other external sources.)The Layer channels can also be used for sending MIDI, when the Global MIDI channel is set to Off. See page 32 for information on how tomake these settings.On my Nord Stage 2 I can select if I send/receive on the MIDI DIN ports or on the MIDI USB port. Not sure if that is applicable for the NW2 as well.So I guess you can use the Global MIDI for receiving the midi file information from your DAW.Do you see the midi led blinking on your NW2 when your DAW is playing/sending the midi file?",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=156210&sid=e5a7d857bf61362c24a290976679db22#p156210

But after being overshadowed by the A1, I strongly suspect something could have been done to improve the Lead 4 (shapeable/better wavetables, replace some FX effects, etc...). But I guess they predicted the costs of development wouldn't convert to more sales, so they didn't do it and discontinued it down the road.The Nord Wave 2 has probably been a failure in sales (according to Thomann website) with a very timid launch. Aside from 1 or 2 pieces, their flagship synth is used as a sidekick to Stage 3/Electro on basically all the Nord sessions released in the past years (when it is present). I always tune in hoping to see the Nord Wave 2 being used to its full potential, just to see it being used 20 seconds out of a 5 minute video for a forgettable pad or lead sound.Several minor things bother me a lot (like the lack of a mix wave section in the MULTI category, only saws mix per layer, really?) but I can live with that, as it does sounds beautiful in the end and a joy to program.However, given the shy sales and presence, I foresee that the Nord Wave 2 will be discontinued before getting an update, even if it take years (like the Nord Lead 4).",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=153098&sid=e5a7d857bf61362c24a290976679db22#p153098

I need to know where should i sent my program change? on the the global channel or on the first layer? If its on the global channel, i need 5 channels (one global for PC, and 4 for each layer).The big downside of this system is that you need to know in advance what sound to use on each layer since you are not able to ""scroll"" patch on each layer, layer not being a patch (hope i 'm clear enough), i know you can copy layer but it's not ideal in this case .

Thiscan for example be used in a multitimbral setup, controlling 4 individualsound sources from a sequencer.E A Layer does not have to be active in a Program to receive MIDI,it will always respond to incoming MIDI on its MIDI Channel. Thismakes it possible to control selected Layers from the keyboard,and other Layers from other external sources.The Layer channels can also be used for sending MIDI, when the GlobalMIDI channel is set to Off.

If I was designing this I would have put the reverb and overdrive as global effects. I can see uses for delay and the modulation effect to stay per layer, and the eq (minus drive) is useful to set individually as well, but drive and verb really do need to interact with the sound as a whole and when you set up a patch which uses multiple layers the sound can feel detached from each of its parts with the current design.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=151757&sid=e5a7d857bf61362c24a290976679db22#p151757

The lubricant component is there to help unlocking rusty or otherwise blocked mechanisms), and I would recommend you absolutely AVOID using it on anything electronic. It does leave a greasy film over the surface which will collect dust.As for contact cleaners, I have no experience with the WD-40 branded one, but I do have experience with other brands, and you have to be careful there too, because some of them are actually more similar in formulation to WD-40 (the ""lubricant"") in that they contain an oily component. No contact cleaner should contain oil of any sort.So you either choose a non oily contact cleaner, or you go with alcohol, which in my experience is the best cleaner ever for electronics. The only thing to be careful with is making sure that near surfaces aren't affected (discolored etc) by it.

A synth action of any kind has springs (metal, plastic, or just the plastic of the key bending - which sounds horrific but is very common in cheap actions), so after being pressed it pushes back with some force, making it somewhat hard to press repeatedly the key at extremely fast speeds. Actually, a semi-weighted action can easily be faster to play than an unweighted one, because the weights help press down the key again and relieve some of the spring pushback.Anyway this largely depends on the tension of the springs, even the same action (like the ubiquitous FATARs) can feel totally different if equipped with different springs, which is the most common customization done by the different manufacturers.For example, the same TP-8o used in the Wave is also used in the Electros (pretty stiff keys) and the Crumar Mojo (very light keys), and most likely the only difference is in spring tension.So we don't really know what to expect from the Wave 2, the only choice is wait until we can try it in person.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=126330&sid=e5a7d857bf61362c24a290976679db22#p126330

The bad choices are mounting up - oversized keyboard, weird Stage look rather than the beloved synth style; the strange single-oscillator decision, the loss of the comb filter, the apparent (not 100% sure) loss of the phase and frequency modulation options for samples which are the absolute core of the Wave's capabilities (it is meant to be a machine to mess with samples), the joke of a single LFO (you just HAVE to have 2x LFOs on Nord synths to get interesting movement in sounds), limited storage...Of course there are some good things - OLED screen, arpeggiator and gates, clock control, 4 layers not 2. But struggling to see much more. Impulse morph has always seemed just a gimmick to me. And really, a Nord Wave 2 worthy of the name could and should have built on the original and added things, not taken them away. On other forums some have commented that this is more of a follow up to the Nord A1, which seems plausible. Finding it very hard not to see this as a missed opportunity. When I first saw the announcement I was really excited and assuming that I would just have to buy one. As more of the details have become clear I think this is more likely to be another debacle like the NL4, which made the same kind of mistakes in terms of capability and is being end-of-lifed prematurely. I've never understood who would buy such a limited instrument as the A1.Clavia Nord have such a great heritage in synths that I hate to see them becoming mostly a maker of cheesy keyboards for cover bands (and I say this as someone who also loves his Nord Piano 2 so has appreciation of the wonderful Piano lines even if organs make my toes curl). The sound quality, the interfaces, the pitch stick, the great sample libraries - these are all such a valuable heritage.

I suspect this not-quite-a-Wave 2 will struggle in that context.I do agree with you on this and of course I think my wording on this is wrong, it's rather late and my mind isn't functioning due to lack of sleep as I'm caring for mum.The Wave 2 from my understanding shouldn't be compared to the original wave as it's a new ground focus, yes there's functions missing I could really do with  but  that's what happens with Nord. I think they need to stop smoking the nord wead and concentrate on customers and professionald who need certain equipment design from them, after all, we're paying customers here.From the description, and also from other feedback here, I'm given the impression that this mimics the stage series in build rather than the original lead chassis, that in itself is a little disappointing, but that said, there are things I do love about this new system that meet what I need. Considering Nord shot themselves in the foot by ending rack based nord leads, that to me is professional suicide. I'd go for the Wave 2 and hunt down an A1 and lead 4 as rack versions, maybe a lead 3 rack also, but that's pretty much it. I guess we can only see what comes forward and when it hits the stores.

Meanwhile several synths are coming out in module/rack /small form factors with a much more appealing  approach.Sorry to disagree here.It is not a case of me being loyal to nord. I'll give my reasons as to why I'd buy the Wave 2 over anything else at the moment.1: I rely on sampling as part of my sound design workflow, when the Grand is taken up with orchestral samples and the stage 3 has pipe organ data on for projects, I don't want to be constantly backing up and replacing data to do other work with when I'm right in the middle of sound programming.2: The Wave 2 offers me functions that workstations from Roland, Korg and Yamaha no longer offer. Accessibility and tactility, when blind, touch screens are useless.3: I grew up with nord leads, stages, etc so do trust their gear.4: A lot of the instruments now being discussed won't be here in the UK such as the. ""udo super 6"" and as they're companies I don't know, I need to road test equipment, I don't rely on youtube videos to listen to, I need to spend time with the instrument personally to review it and then make a decision. Been burnt before buying hardware to find it just doesn't work for me as I need it to.5: I've worked with god knows how many synths, samplers, workstations, etc over the years, the synths of yesteryear have either gone, become ridiculously expensive to buy used in the UK or have been abused to the point where sellers think it's their god given right to sell crap at a high price.The Wave 2 covers what I need. The Stage 3 synthesis does provide some support but not enough. If nord released rack versions of their gear again, I would be perfectly fine, that way a stage 3 could go on the road with a couple of rack nords for further support. But nord have shot themselves in the foot with me on this. so I will have to look at buying used Rack A1 and Lead 4 units for synthesis to work with the stage 3 and also the Wave 2. my mind is made up.Korg released the Wavestate, what a turn off. it's a toy not a professional synth / workstation. Korg have lost the plot. Look at the Kronos, no updates on it, no changes other than paint work and an italian grand, no processor or hardware changes since 2011. it's ridiculous. Korg are just pandering to their share holders and not taking pros like us seriously.Roland announced the new Jupiter, yet other than some marketing on their website, the only version out is the XM which I wouldn't nudge with a wet flannel. let alone anything else, bring out the full keyboard edition and I might consider it.just researched the UDO super 6. WOW! and UK made, even more interesting. Thank you for that mind blowing piece of info. whilst at it. Waldorf have introduced the Kyra (Kyro?) module synth, 128 voice for a good price by the sound of it. hmmmmm food for thought.lew",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=126370&sid=e5a7d857bf61362c24a290976679db22#p126370

The place where the stage lags a bit is in handling fast articulated horn parts. It doesn't help that samples are only single-layer, but that is a different issue. So for me adding a 3rd tier to my keyboard rig has to bring something I don't already have.Spring tension will affect speed to some degree, but there is much more involved than just tension. Both mass, center of mass (pivot point), and trigger location all play a part in how much time it takes for a key to return to resting position and how quickly it can be triggered in succession.

And it also makes no sense if you then enjoy the very same keybed in other top synths.Not saying that there are no differences between different models and brands, but they are largely due to different spring tension and different velocity curves, and most likely have nothing to do with the physical weight of the keys themselves.So, until we can try in person how strong are the springs in the Wave 2 keybed and how velocity curves are implemented, this whole discussion is pointless and I find it quite a bit surreal.Can we please settle this non-existing issue and move on?",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=126441&sid=e5a7d857bf61362c24a290976679db22#p126441

Their stage is a success. But I will probably cease buying nords. I love their sound. But they forgot about us.I could go on and on about recent synth releases with 49 keys, module and rack versions, and no weighted action.Simply, disappointingProof again that there's no pleasing everyone.  A great many people have long decried the plasticky touch and light weight of the NL1/NL2/NL2X/NL4/NLA1 actions, the absence of aftertouch, and the 49-note limitation.  These people will now be very happy indeed with these very positive developments.As for rack/module version, the front panel would need to be split in half and tiered one over the other to fit into a 19"" rack.  Such a thing would probably consume 8U.  No one wants a rack synth which needs 8U all to itself.  Plus, the buying public has repeatedly demonstrated to Nord that they are not interested in rack units.  It only stands to reason that if folks were ever actually purchasing them in numbers, they would not have been discontinued.Unfortunately, because most of my NAMM time was spent engineering 18 live performances in three days, among other things, I did not have a complete opportunity to delve into the detailed guts of the new Wave 2.  What I can say is that everyone who spent any amount of time at NAMM 2020 with a pair of headphones plugged into one of these walked away with a smile of their face and lust in their heart.

Really this should be an expanded wave with the features of the lead 4 and A1, but it's not., it's like the argos of synths (uk joke)lewFYI, I have been in contact with someone at Sequential regarding the accessibility of the new Pro3, which seems to have a very similar layout to the Prophet X. The Pro3, excluding possibly some parts of the sequencer (which I don't need anyway) and a couple very particular mod matrix mappings, seems very useable once the hidden functions are understood. For example, take the mod matrix. If you wish to map a parameter to the expression pedal, you simply press source, move the pedal, press destination, adjust the knob you wish to control, then dial in the amount with the amount knob. Very easy. This even works with aftertouch and velocity!Now, that is all about the Pro3, but as I said the overall interface appears to be very similar on the X. I suggest contacting Sequential with questions; the person I've been communicating with has been very helpful and straightforward. Yes, you can actually talk to people at Sequential direct, unlike Nord it seems.As for the sampling aspect, a multisample can have up to 20 velocity layers. That is a huge advantage over the Wave. I am not sure how well the sample editor works for us blind users, but you can download to test. It's a 3rd party one, Lady Gaia's PX Toolkit. There's another one made by 8Dio but it is apparently not so good.And the build quality of Sequential synths is very nice too... I had a Prophet6 and the keyboard felt fantastic. It also had the best feeling pitch wheel I've used, in that it was somehow easier for me to have precise control even with a larger bend range. I will have the Pro3 sometime in Febuary hopefully, so can give you some pointers on the overall interface; it obviously won't be exactly the same as they're different synths but hopefully it will give a good idea.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=127334&sid=e5a7d857bf61362c24a290976679db22#p127334

Really this should be an expanded wave with the features of the lead 4 and A1, but it's not., it's like the argos of synths (uk joke)lewFYI, I have been in contact with someone at Sequential regarding the accessibility of the new Pro3, which seems to have a very similar layout to the Prophet X. The Pro3, excluding possibly some parts of the sequencer (which I don't need anyway) and a couple very particular mod matrix mappings, seems very useable once the hidden functions are understood. For example, take the mod matrix. If you wish to map a parameter to the expression pedal, you simply press source, move the pedal, press destination, adjust the knob you wish to control, then dial in the amount with the amount knob. Very easy. This even works with aftertouch and velocity!Now, that is all about the Pro3, but as I said the overall interface appears to be very similar on the X. I suggest contacting Sequential with questions; the person I've been communicating with has been very helpful and straightforward. Yes, you can actually talk to people at Sequential direct, unlike Nord it seems.As for the sampling aspect, a multisample can have up to 20 velocity layers. That is a huge advantage over the Wave. I am not sure how well the sample editor works for us blind users, but you can download to test. It's a 3rd party one, Lady Gaia's PX Toolkit. There's another one made by 8Dio but it is apparently not so good.And the build quality of Sequential synths is very nice too... I had a Prophet6 and the keyboard felt fantastic. It also had the best feeling pitch wheel I've used, in that it was somehow easier for me to have precise control even with a larger bend range. I will have the Pro3 sometime in Febuary hopefully, so can give you some pointers on the overall interface; it obviously won't be exactly the same as they're different synths but hopefully it will give a good idea.I look forward to that very much. So, 20 layers to a multisample? ooh. beat that nord.That's the thing with nord, people don't seem to realise that and they won't agree with me, Nords when it comes to sampling are basically modern mellotrons with a little extra thrown in, there's no sample morphing or synthesis like you'd find on Waldorf, Sequential, etc, it's more a sample player than serious synthesis.yep, you and I both know how hard it is to get answers from Nord, they don't like talking. shame really.The pro3 sounds nice, but I'm more a 61 key guy, I like working scope lol.lew",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=127337&sid=e5a7d857bf61362c24a290976679db22#p127337

The TP/8 runs deep below the front panel, making the key-travel more even and more comfortable to play.No FM with Samples: It was interesting on the original Wave. But to be frank, I didn't find use for it.

There's only one destination and by design, since the two LEDs indicate the Filter destination, there is not even possibility of a firmware update to do that (unless you include a weird, albeit cool, blinking LED code).

But remember, this is per layer. So if you do not group the LFO's, but you group the filter section, then you can have multiple LFO's on one filter. Or one LFO to each grouped section representing the destinations of the LFO. So if you have sections of layer A and B grouped together, but the LFO from Layer A and B isn't grouped together, then you have two LFO's at your disposal.it seems a bit similar to how the algorithms in Roland synths work, where you can change the arrangement of each synth section, but on the Nord Wave 2 it seems to be freely assignable.In regards to vibrato, there is already a dedicated vibrato LFO. (bottom of Page 17. in the manual).It's a shame the LFO can't modulate amplitude.Your best bet on the Wave 2 is to use the tremolo effect.Polyphonic Glide might be one of the compromises. It's a cool effect. Could be it's not that popular among performance synthesists.In general, this instrument is a performance synthesizer. It's probably not the right toy for the synth enthuisasts and noise makers, it's for players in mind. There will allways be compromises, but in return you get a very tactile, hands on, time efficient instrument you can just grab and be creative with a steep learning curve.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=130166&sid=e5a7d857bf61362c24a290976679db22#p130166

Particularly as a performance instrument it baffles me because there is so little control over it and, while I think the Wave2 may have changed this, previously it was global. So if you wanted a fast deep minimoog-style vibrato on one patch and a slow gentle one on another, you had to use the full LFO anyway or go into a menu to change it mid performance. That's not performance-friendly. And if you want to do what I mentioned earlier (pitch and filter mod at the same time for a more organic vibrato) you can't use it anyway.Right, this is intended for keyboardists more than synthesists specifically, which is why I am amazed at some of the missing features. Nord has been marketing heavily to a lot of gospel, jazz fusion and funk players lately. It is very common to hear a synth lead with an LFO that modulates 2 things at once in these styles. It is also very common to hear poly glide in those styles for the big chord stacks etc. And the layout overall is not what most players are used to; if you want osc sync you press the sync button, not search for the correct factory configuration. Or what if you want to shape the pulse width and also detune the second oscillator by a little bit for that chorused sound? There is unison but that is not the same thing, as nice as it can sound. etc...a lot of players don't want to spend time learning a new architecture, they want to get their sounds set up and jam.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=130168&sid=e5a7d857bf61362c24a290976679db22#p130168

I needed to program about 80 patches to supplement the ones in my NS3 where I was using the A1 before. It is a great instrument, in my opinion, the only thing I have not figured out is when I use the NS3 Extern section to play sounds on the W2, even if both keyboards have identical split points, the NS 3 doesn't seem to recognize the points in the W2 and plays sounds outside of the splits.  The Drive feature in the EQ section is not as strong as I would like, but the filter drive is better than the A1.No big problem with the reverbs, I just find that for live playing, super long reverbs like Cathedral are mostly unnecessary.

I'm not sure if my experiment is completely valid, but when I'm playing a sine wave at A3 (220 Hz) and put the EQ as a parametric filter at 222 Hz and attenuate it at -15dB and vary it to +15 dB and with drive at +10, I hear the tone going from mildly driven to full overdrive, i.e. the overtones are strongly affected. This should NOT be the case if the filter is post-EQ and hence seem to indicate that the EQ is placed before the drive (as also indicated by the order of the knobs top-down). I'm curious what @DJKeys bases his conclusion on; I could be wrong of course2. No, the morph only affects the volume. But if you want the amount of drive to be morphed, you can just add a morph on the drive button too and then you get exactly what you're after.3.

I used a saw wave, as it has more frequencies and it definitely seemed to me that the EQ (both bass and treble, or parametric) affected the tone of the drive.  There is also an issue (which I discussed in my original first impressions thread) that the drive effect seems to target some frequencies much more than others, so getting the right drive effect for me is still difficult  (unlike the NS3).

In most situations you would want EQ first and other effects later.  However, because of the flexibility of the design, you can pretty much get any tones you like out of this instrument.

The scenario that you created is essentially Live being 4 midi controllers sending notes. My scenario was the Wave2 acting as 4 midi controllers sending information to Live which in turn would record this information and send it back to the 4 sound engines inside the Wave2. The thing that could potentially happen with certain external sequencers is a slight doubling or echo artifacts that come from the internal note message triggering sound and the external sequencer triggering the same notes again a few milliseconds later. This artifact is fixed by setting the midi to “local off” breaking the internal connection. So my work around is going to be hauling 3 extra midi controllers to my upcoming shows. This problem does not exist in other Nords. Midi implementation was amazing in the first Stage Classic and has gotten increasingly crippled or “simplified” in the NS2 and NS3.,https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=148472&sid=01c8f9773435d1d57d761075ca7fdd02#p148472

Hold a chord and listen while you go through the decimals.  When in Gate mode, it controls the envelope settings.  From page 18 of the Manual:RANGE / ENVThe range which an arpeggio spans is determined by the RANGE knob.At the 0 setting the arpeggio only uses the actual notes played on thekeyboard. In Poly mode this translates to the played note or chordbeing retriggered and repeated as is. Apart from the the values of evenoctaves, ranging from 1-4, values between each octave can be used aswell for arpeggios ranging for example 2 octaves and a fifth.When the GATE is active this knob controls the envelope (ENV) of theGate. At the zero position the envelope is very soft, producing a smoothamplitude modulation. At the maximum position the envelope is very“hard”, in effect turning the sound on and off in accordance with theGate tempo and pattern.Hope this helps--dj",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=147023&sid=01c8f9773435d1d57d761075ca7fdd02#p147023

First turn global program change (MIDI menu) on the NS3 off, then in one of the Extern sections (EXTERN menu), set the midi channel to the NW2 global channel and the program change number as desired. Then for that Extern section you can switch off all zones, so that it only sends the Program Change messages but no note data. To switch off all the zones, hold shift, and press the Extern section on/off until no green zone LEDs are lit.  I use this approach to change programs on the NW2 from the NS3.You can also use Dual KB mode to play the NS3 panel B organ from the NW2.I find the MIDI implementation of the NW2 a bit limited and frustrating so I resorted to using an iPad running MidiFlow to duplicate MIDI channels so that I can for example play 2 NW2 layers from the NS3 and 2 layers from the NW2 keyboard.

Yes, that would be an alternative but unfortunately I do not own an Electro.

This has generally worked well allowing me to make lush soundscapes. The only real issue has been the disproportionately high levels of hiss from the Pigtronix.However, there are a number of other pedals I’ve recently acquired including a Red Panda Particle and a Montreal Assembly Count To Five both of which are mono in and mono out. I’ve also bought a Hologram Microcosm which is mono in and stereo out.I want to work out how to cull a few items (maybe use them through a patchbay or Ableton’s External Effecfs devices) and combine a bunch of the other devices some of which are stereo and others mono. Has anyone any suggestions how best to do this? Would ABY switches be one way of doing it? Am I correct in thinking that the Wave 1 is true stereo not dual mono?  I initially thought of starting the chain with a single output from the Particle then the CT5 and then the mono input into the Microcosm. The stereo outputs from that ham go into the Strymons although I can’t figure where to place the compressor.Or, should I make two racks, one stereo one mono and a separate one for the Pigtronix and use the them in my patchbay?

It turns out that it was as simple as clicking the 'restore' button.  That made not sense to be before.  But it obviously made a lot of sense to Don Solaris who made the backup file to be loaded via clicking 'restore' and is still a Wave owner according to his profile on this site.  He actually wrote me three emails telling me to come to this forum and to read the manual (which I had done but obviously didn't understand).

I tried modulating many of the patches with ""WHL"" in the patch name, and also set up just a basic patch with filter cutoff modulation with the mod wheel, no response, it seems to do absolutely nothing.Is their any settings I am overlooking here ? (I looked through all the system settings and didn't see anything related to the mod wheel), is their any explanation to this type of behaviour ?Hard to believe its just fully broken and disconnected from the circuit board etc...Any advice appreciated, thank you- DanPS. is their a tech support forum I should post this message in ?Also, does the OLED display show anything numerically when the mod wheel is being moved ?",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=140098&sid=01c8f9773435d1d57d761075ca7fdd02#p140098

Did you get any kind of guarrantee that could cover the repair cost? If you contact clavia they will probably prompt you to your local dealer.Another solution is to find an experienced technician in your town and let him check it. Removing the top cover is an easy task (you can also do it yourself with a screwdriver) and the MW mechanism is very easy to access and check connections. I did the same with my original wave sometime ago when the MW didn't stay in place. I bet there is not much difference between all nord keyboards in the way the chasis is assmblied.,https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=140106&sid=01c8f9773435d1d57d761075ca7fdd02#p140106

And there are a huge variety of these sorts of Ring Mod sounds that the A1 can do. But of course the Wave does not have amplitude modulation but maybe there is a way to fake this?You could possibly achieve something similar with Frequency Modulation on the OSC MOD section instead (see page 24 in the manual.) The shape and amount levels can be assigned to a morph source (e.g pedal so you have your hands free for playing) and control them from there, but they can also be controled by an LFO.However, you can control just the amplitude with an LFO (or 2), but the OSc Mod will give you more sonic possibilities, even better than just amplitude modulation I believe.If you mess around a little bit with this I'm sure you can get prety close.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=139215&sid=b224f7fbd15fe0c53ba55c208352a8f3#p139215

I also cannot load a folder just a file even though there is load a folder functionality.  I have latest firmware.The process seems to be that I need to download each individual sample to capacity each time and that is tedious.  Alternatively it seems that maybe if I load each set manually I could then do a backup and give that load a specific name to reflect the samples used.

The sounds are tied to programs and the bundle options helps with that issue. It shouldn't be too tedious. I will try and give some specific instructions and hope I'm not being tedious.To upload a selection of sounds to your computer:In Sound Manager make sure that Samp Lib (rather than program) is selected.Select the beginning of the group of sounds you want to upload to your computer by clicking on that sound.Scroll down to the bottom of the group of sounds, hit shift on your computer keyboard and then mouse click on that bottom sound.The group should now be highlighted in blue.Select Sound Up at the top of the Sound Manager. This will launch a box to confirm that you really do want to upload your group of sounds. Clicking Upload will launch another window allowing you to specify where you want those sounds to go.This is how it works on my Mac. I don't know about Windows anymore.Alternately you could just delete the sounds on your Wave2 and get more samples from the Nord web site.I would like to raise the question of why any of this being necessary at all. 1 GB is small these days and more memory in a Wave2 seems very realistic. There is something to be said for keeping the sample size small enough to be manageable and not just endlessly adding more and more, and we can get loads of sounds into 1 GB. Perhaps Nord will sell a Wave3 in the future with more memory and this is some marketing strategy, but I'd rather not think that way.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=138597&sid=b224f7fbd15fe0c53ba55c208352a8f3#p138597

I could not get it to consistently sync across multiple layers once a patch was saved and re-selected later. This made synth-style vibrato, at best, a guessing game as to whether it would behave correctly or not.I had posted about this on another forum, and DJ Keys had actually tested some stuff on this for me and could not replicate it. My hope is that it was only a bug with my unit somehow...An easy way to test, for those interested:1. Use 2 layers. Set both to the same sound, but for clarity I would put them an octave apart.2. Add both to the group for LFO editing, or use multi edit mode. Set the LFO however you like. For now, it should be in sync.3. Save patch, reload it later and see if it's still in sync. You can move to other patches and back again multiple times to confirm it is working.If unsure, slow the LFO rate down a lot and it will be very obvious if it is working or not because if out of sync the LFO's may  travel in opposite directions!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=137449&sid=b224f7fbd15fe0c53ba55c208352a8f3#p137449

One day...!Every synth has their limitations, that's for sure. Sometimes those limitations can be sources for creativity. Don't get me wrong, I still love breaking out the trusty moog and cranking the filter overdrive, but the W2 is also so inspiring to jam on it, it can get so deep so quick and back again. It's nice when a synth can go from tight snaps to massive reverb land with the turn of the wheel, with 4 simultaneous arps with different time divisions going around in crazy clockwork counter-rhythms! The tension on the mod stick reminds me of playing a guitar when bending, I like that you really have to dig into it a bit.I also love the Nord pitch bender. As wheels go, I think the Prophet6's pitch wheel is one of the easiest to precisely control, which is funny because when you play it there is not a lot of tension on the spring and you'd think it'd be harder to be super accurate with it, but it works really well in practice at least for my fingers! Anyway, there really is nothing like the Nord bender, especially for vibrato it is unmatched. And in many ways the Nord is a far deeper synth than the Prophet. Both have advantages and disadvantages. If the bug in the Nord wasn't there (see above post for that info) I would pick the Nord over the P6 without needing to think much at all. I don't personally have the budget to own a whole room full of synths and the Nord becomes even more useful with that information.I really do hope that the issue I described above gets fixed, because for the short time I did own the Nord, I could really have seen myself keeping it and pairing it with something like an Electro for keyboard sounds. That would make a great little keys rig for me.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=137450&sid=b224f7fbd15fe0c53ba55c208352a8f3#p137450

The leads do not support samples though...When it comes to organ and piano then you have to compromize with samples or wavetables as there are no dedicated piano and organ engines. You can have some acceptable tones with those samples but not as realistic as the piano and organ of your electro. There is no leslie simulation for organ, the only way is to fake it with an LFO.The best solution for you is to sell the electro and get a stage if you can afford it, if not then keep the electro and add a cheap synth on top, there are lots of good synths from other manufacturers in much lower price than the wave.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=134565&sid=b224f7fbd15fe0c53ba55c208352a8f3#p134565

Hope it helps.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLiaEF4Jhw0I look forward to studying the video you gave for help. I spent a lot of time fine tuning the start and end points of each note's loop, but I think my problem was the original tone had a couple oscillators which were slightly detuned, and they added some natural beating between oscillators. This became faster in duration the higher the pitch. This wouldn't be a noticeable problem playing on the Voyager itself, but when translated to a sample it made it problematic finding a loop point that didn't seem like an unnatural lfo cycling back, if that makes sense. And maybe I should have used the whole duration minus the cutoff.So, I think recording much longer samples might help, or eliminating the detune or even adjusting the detune up the scale to keep the pitch beating more manageable as pitch increases. In some ways, the end result worked out okay and provided some variation that almost mimics envelope or lfo variation that might occur in a vintage instrument.And thanks!

The A4 is sending date from Track 1 / Channel 1 and is going into the NW2 set to receive it on Midi Channel 1. The data includes note, note length, note velocity as well as the incoming midi clock. If I sequence notes on their own it's not an issue, but once I start involving the NW2s time-based features (ARP, LFO, FX) its a literal disaster. I can get the ARP to sync when it's just receiving incoming MIDI clock data and Im playing the notes manually by hand. But if I try to send those notes via MIDI all bets are off. I've never had an issue like this with any of my other devices, including Nord Leads. I have a Cirklon Sequencer and that can't get it to stick either.

The only things I know, I have been discovering them since when I got a reface DX (which I love!), and reading stuff online. And what I have noticed so far is that there seems to be a fair amount of confusion and vagueness, on the internet, around how FM works. I am not sure if that's because it is too complex for the layman to grasp, or because there simply is a lot of confusion around something that could be explained more clearly but for some reason isn't. Or it could be a mix of both.It seems that the very basic, yet theoretical, thing that's unclear is the very two variables FM works with.According to the way I have understood it so far, and nothing else, those variables are:- FM frequency, which is thespeedyou basically apply vibrato to a pitch with,- FM amount, which is actually therangeof that vibrato, up and down by the same amount (for linear FM at least).This is no different than pitch bending a note with the pitch bend stick within a given range, except that our arms can only move as fast as ""a few"" oscillations per second, which will result in just... well, vibrato. When that bending speed becomes way higher and approaches similar frequencies of the ones of the very note you are pitch-bending, though, ""interesting"" (or perhaps ""unpredictable"") results start to appear. You cease to hear, say, Ab-A-A#-A-Ab-A-..., or G-A-B-A-G-A-...; instead you'll hear just A but with a lot of harmonics.Now, it seems to me that most FM synthesizers do two things:- They tell you FM ""frequency"" in various ways, but generally as aratiobetween the modulator and the pitch you are FM-ising, for example ""twice the frequency"", ""a quarter the frequency"", and the like;- They DON'T explicitly tell you therangeof this super fast vibrato you're applying. Instead, they have sliders (physical or virtual) that let you set the FM ""amount"". Whether that's going to be in the range of microtones, semitones, tones, octaves, or the universe knows, I have no idea.The Synth on the NS3 does the first of those things in a way that in my opinion is even more convenient of the traditional ""ratio"" way, that is, it tells you how many semitones away that frequency will turn out to be from the pitch being FM-ised, which is more handy. But regarding the second thing, you simply have a knob which, once again, doesn't tell you how many semitones you are making that vibrato range expanding to and from.Now, I don't know the Wave 2, but if we want to use the language I've employed in this post, so far, you are saying that the Wave 2 doesn't have a control for vibrato speed, but only for vibrato range -- albeit we don't still have a clue about how big that would be in semitones.Is all the above fair? Aren't you sure the ""speed"" parameter isn't hidden somewhere else under another menu, possibly called in a different way?EDIT: I am aware that knowing that value, in semitones, wouldn't be useful since the only thing we care of is the final sound. But still, it would be nice to at least know for a fact that that's the parameter being modified, and by how much.EDIT 2: The fact that the same effect of FM is achievable via Phase shifting, and therefore that this is what's really going on under the hood of a ""FM"" synthesizer, doesn't in my view change a thing about the need to know exactly how the parameters are being affected.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=135115&sid=b224f7fbd15fe0c53ba55c208352a8f3#p135115

I did run into them but didn't look very thoroughly. Seemed too complex for my level, but I guess it's time to dive in.This is not the appropriate place to talk FM, I guess, but my main beef with FM so far would be that it isn't so much about it being difficult, but rather it being *unpredictable*, and therefore, of lesser use than something less capable in theory but much more straightforward in practice.Even the very basic principle FM works by, namely the fact that once the vibrato oscillation speed approaches audible frequencies, we cease to hear vibrato but instead we hear the same note with a higher harmonics content, isn't THAT predictable to me. I mean it took FM to find that out, it wasn't predictable before. Now we kind of accept it for granted. Conversely, if I apply a low pass filter to a wave, I can pretty much anticipate what's going to happen, and I can thus build my sound the way I want it.With FM, when more complex setups are employed (a chain of modulators), then it seems to me the level of unpredictability goes so high that it becomes a sort of trial and error until you get, almost by chance, the sound you need. And all of this only when using modulators frequencies which are equal to the pitch of the carrier, or an octave or a fifth away. If the frequency ratio is some non round number such as 1,354, then the only results I have been getting are akin to pure noise...Of course I am exaggerating, but this was to give a layman impression.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=135201&sid=b224f7fbd15fe0c53ba55c208352a8f3#p135201

I enabled two layers, dialled one with 0.2 osc mod pitch amount (and I also tried other amounts), and the other with none. I get a little expected pitch movement on the modulated layer, as per the envelope settings, and then it settles back to being perfectly in tune with the 0.0 layer.But... the Osc Mod Env has the AR (Attack/Release) mode as well, and that works a different way. For the default AD (Attack/Decay) mode, modulated pitch deviates from 0 (in tune) during the attack phase, and goes back to it in the decay phase. Notes start and finish bang in tune, as long as the osc mod envelope has enough time to complete its whole cycle. However, if you have it in AR mode then the attack phase brings the noteintotune - where it sits for the sustain portion (it really should be called an 'ASR') - and then pulls it back out again when the key is released and the envelope release phase triggers. So notes essentially begin and end out of tune. I wonder if it's that you're hearing. It certainly can make for some super-wonky tuning if you have amp release time set quite long. It would obviously do it with any envelope amount though, not just 0.2.This is on the latest 1.14 OS, btw.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=135150&sid=b224f7fbd15fe0c53ba55c208352a8f3#p135150

Stuff such as a regular waveform plus a bell or a noise etc - where you can tune the additional sound and use the osc control to determine the amount of mix between the two. This also works for samples so you can do some cool mixtures of acoustic sounds and noise or acoustic sounds and saw/sqr/tri etc.  All of this is gone from the Wave 2 algorithms, me thinks (unless i'm missing something).Also, fm and waveshape could be applied on the NS3 on all the first 3 categories (analog, waves, formant). Not so on the Wave 2.And finally, ""ring modulation"" (not as an fx) could be applied on the NS3 on all the waves from 'analog', 'waves', 'formant' - and also the samples.Both ringmod and shape modulation are missing from the Wave 2 when it comes to the digital waves which on the NS3 can change their tone but on the Wave 2 remain static and you can't change their shape, sync or fm them.What, to my understanding, you gain on the Wave 2 engine - is a dedicated tune and fine tune knobs, multiwaves, a more complex FM engine.Did i miss anything?If i'm mistaken or completely missed how the osc section on the Wave 2 works then please correct me.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=134694&sid=b224f7fbd15fe0c53ba55c208352a8f3#p134694

I'm most appreciative of how good it is and it is a huge upgrade over both the A1 and the Stage Compact for my purposes.The patches are mostly there to get you started. They are instructional more than anything. With the A1 there were some outstanding libraries added later. Some of that has already happened with the Wave 2, and here's hoping there will be more.Nord patches are never flashy as much as instructional and a means to get you started. Indeed, on the NW2 there are at least 50 (of the 400) that are outstanding. The rest are just basic structures. But even those are useful. The acoustic guitar patch, for example, has a lovely delay when you turn the wheel. Layer 2 has some FM to give it body and ballast. On Layer three I added a cello to provide a drone. That's enough.The NW2 has taken some critical hits from advanced synthesists and I'm sure some of their criticisms are justified.

Subtle changes to several parameters to achieve pleasing results.So it's mostly a question of information. If you could test that, i'd appreciate it very much.I'm trying to make up my mind between the NW2 and the Novation Summit. The Summit has a mod matrix (and an additional mod matrix dedicated just for the fx section). That's deep. Not to mention the analog filters.But setting up modulation invloves menu diving, there are less options in the osc section (except it has real wavetables and not just single cycle waves).But to me, in lot of cases it makes more sense to have a morph type of modulation than a constant type of modulation. Although the Summit allows modulating parameters via velocity, aftertouch, wheel and expression pedal just like the NW2 as well as having two ""annimate"" buttons (which work like the impulse morph). But each mod assign like this occupies one mod slot of the 16. Which brings me back to the reason i'm trying to understand if there's a limit to how many parameters can be assigned via the morph system.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=134484&sid=b224f7fbd15fe0c53ba55c208352a8f3#p134484

You can decide you route all four lfo to the filter, each with a different rate to create complex movement or rhythmic movement which is the result of one filter being modulated by 4 independent lfos.On the wave 2, it seems (correct me if i'm wrong), what you describe is that if you choose a 24db lowpass filter and group all layers, when you modulate the filter with each lfo what you hear is the sound of the filter on layer 1, plus the sound of the filter on layer 2, plus the sound of the filter on layer 3 plus the sound of the filter on layer 4. They all happen to be the same filter type - but it's not the same sonic result as having one filter being modulated by 4 lfos.But perhaps i misunderstood.

I assumed that the Nord Wave 2 would be somewhat redundant but I figured I would eventually replace the A1. You have many more synths than I do, so I don't intend this as advice as much as an opportunity to discuss how I'm using the Wave 2 in my early days with it. I hope other users also discuss how they are exploring the instrument. I've been exploring the Wave 2 for a few weeks now. At first I was underwhelmed by the presets, but then I made a conceptual switch and began to look at the presets as instructional rather than a great library for personal use. However, there are some great presets, and some with interesting hidden features. One way I'm understanding how the Wave 2 works is by studying my favorite presets. Another approach is finding programs I most like on the Nord Stage 3 and the A1 and then reproducing them on the Wave 2. Obviously you can't do that with the pianos, organs, and clavs on the Compact 3, but you can for pretty much everything else. On the A1, the only thing (I believe) that you can't reproduce are the formant waves, but they are less important as there are so many great vocal samples on the Wave 2. Having said all of that, I have not yet begun to do what I suggest, leaving it, I suppose as a winter activity. What I have done is modify many of the presets, and then experiment with the samples. For me, the best feature of the Wave 2 is the ability to seamlessly layer four different samples, or to mix them with FM (something you can't really do with the other instruments). The two best features of the wave are (1) the fantastic layering-oriented interface (2) the rich mix of virtual analog, FM. Wavetable, and samples. I've been taking an experimental approach to sound design, flipping the knobs, seeing what happens, and learning from that. I think the most challenging learning curve is understanding how to integrate the arpeggiator with the delays, syncing them so as to create dynamic movement possibilities.

As many of you will know the good old Prophet 5 and indeed the DSI Prophet 6 have a section called Poly Mod. This differs from ordinary modulation in that both its modulation sources and destinations are associated with one specific voice/note. e.g. modulating a voice’s oscillator with its own filter envelope, or a voice’s filter cutoff with the velocity associated with its assigned note. These are examples of poly modulation because they only effect one voice.  Whereas for example, channel aftertouch and mod wheel modulations are expected to effect all the voices of that layer according to the morph and hardwired assignments of the program – sometimes called channel mod.Morph mod sources on the NW2 include velocity, wheel, pedal and aftertouch. Of these only velocity is a polymod source.So my questions: -1. If I apply velocity through a morph to filter frequency is this a polymod modulation ie effecting only the voice to which the velocity is assigned, or does it effect all voices playing?2. It's possible to use a layer’s morph velocity assignment to turn down (or off!) the layer’s output for higher velocities BUT, does this effect all voices playing on that layer or only the one to which the velocity is assigned.

I'm not sure if I understand either of you correctly, but:0) All morphs are applied to notes in the particular layer only. So you can seamlessly transition from a layer A sound to layer B by setting up two morphs from 0 to 10 and from 10 to 0 respectively on velocity )or any other morphs).1) If I apply velocity morph to a filter frequency, each note played will sound with the morph value derived from its own velocity. Hence, if I play two notes at different velocity on a layer where I velocity morph from 220 Hz to 32 kHz, the lowest velocity note (MIDI 1) will sound with filter frequency 220 Hz and the higher velocity note (MIDI 127) with the filter fully open.2) I'm not sure if I understand the question correctly, but any note played with a velocity morphed output (modulated from 10 to 0, e.g.) will play at the output level corresponding to its velocity. So again, playing two notes in that layer at low and high velocities will mean that the low velocity layer will sound loud (or at full output) and the high velocity layer at lowest amplitude (or not at all).So I think it works as it should -- and each note plays at its own velocity.And that is maybe different to what DJKeys says that ""it affects all notes played""?",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=132307&sid=1011956d8606812c50325e5c86863f67#p132307

I retested this with a single layer, default patch.  I set the morph so more velocity makes the sound softer as before, and was pleased to discover that each note will behave according to its Midi velocity (1-127). I was just hitting a chord before.  So it appears that the Velocity morph feature is indeed applied on a voice/note basis within a single layer! It works the same way for filter cutoff.

Even with morph the effect is limited by the overall sensitivity of the source.The NW2 engine is clearly capable of some very subtle, beautiful, musical creativity, it deserves a musician's interface that truly allows their skills to be articulated. After all why did Nord choose the keybed they did? It is capable of much more precise velocity and AT control than the previous NL A1/4.

This is because an instrument of this quality deserves the subtlety And nuance that can be added by after touch and velocity.It is disappointing that Nord have only provided a velocity on off control for the filter and a crude three step control for amplitude control. This places a huge emphasis on the velocity calibration on the instrument being right in the sweet spot for both these important modulation features. Otherwise velocity control is of limited use.On most of the NW2 competitors both velocity scaling and after touch scaling (sensitivity adjust) are available from a system menu (e.g. Kronos, Kurzweil Forte and DSI Prophet X) Nord has chosen not to provide this. Why? Are their in-house calibrations so much better than their competitors ? Or do they think that velocity and after touch control is unimportant?Perhaps the latter is the truth. After all Nord have yet to provide their standard sample libraries with the facility to hold velocity switched sample layers. This is something that all their competitors have done for years. It was one of the reasons I dumped the NS2 back in 2014 and 6 years later they still haven’t caught up.Maybe they don’t think velocity is important enough and that the beautiful subtly of the harmonic change made possible with switched velocity sample layers is something their customers need. To me it seems Nord are forever backward looking in their aim to produce products that replicate the sounds of at least 35 years ago.If the NW2 can have vibrato depth and rate adjustment in a system menu then why can’t there be velocity depth and scale for filter and VCA? And why can’t there be after touch sensitivity? These are obvious system menus.Pity because the NW2 could have been a lot more than another wall of sound producing slab.

I would love to think that using velocity as a morph modulation source would provide enough subtle control over its effect. I’m sure we all know that mod wheel morph is good but just how much control is possible using velocity?Maybe someone can feedback as to how effective it is.Here’s a scenario:Let’s suppose we want to produce a velocity layered bass guitar sound. We can creat two sample maps (one for each velocity layer) and load them into the NW2. We can assign these to two of the NW2’s parts (one to each). We can then use velocity morph to control the vca level on each. The lower velocity part being morphed negativity so that for soft playing it will be loud and for hard playing it will be quiet. The second, high velocity, sample map part would be morphed positively so that it only sounds when played harder.So this (although crude) could be a way of providing velocity  switched (x faded!) sample playback.My guess is this should work but it may not be that effective without the ability to adjust the keybed velocity curve and sensitivity. It has certainly been my experience that this is necessary on other keyboards. Take the DSI prophet 6, a great synth but we fought long and hard to get Dave’s guys to add some usable velocity curves to it!! LolWith Kurzweil we actually persuaded them to add a per note velocity calibration facility for the Forte, this really improved the Fatar TP40 performance a lot.My view is morphs are a great feature but you have to get the modulation sources in the right range to provide usable control. That’s why there’s calibration for the external swell pedal..... Different people play with different strengths and all keybeds have tolerances. This means user calibration for velocity and after touch is important.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=132038&sid=1011956d8606812c50325e5c86863f67#p132038

Specifically for the layer volume, you can use that in combination with the amp vel settings off, 1, 2 and 3, so in essence you can combine the 4 different scalings provided with your own scaling -- for instance, you could velocity morph layer volume from 5 to 10 AND use amp vel setting 2 if you want it to be a little softer at lower amplitudes, or the other way round, e.g. morphing from 10 to 5 using amp vel 3, which gives you just a slight scaling a bit like amp vel 1 (but probably with a slightly different curve).In addition, you can in many cases also morph the filter settings to open up the higher frequency content at higher velocities, making the tone brighter and louder and/or you can morph not only the filter frequency but also the envelope amount, so you effectively also have full control of how velocity sensitive it should be.I thought from your first post that you had a NW2 yourself, but if not, you should definitely try playing with the velocity morphing. I think it can do more creatively than what may be apparent from a quick read of the manual. At least I find that combining the different parameters e.g. the way I listed above gives you at least some of what you're asking for.My personal guess is that, as Nord is about well-designed and musical controls and less about offering abilities to tweak settings like the curves, that it is not likely that a velocity curve editor is added to the game. But I could very well be wrong, of courseThe swell pedal calibration is needed to make the instrument work with multiple pedals; I have several of different types and if the wrong curve is picked, it's not working well. So it's not so much about personal preferences, but more objectively that the useable range of one pedal may be only 20% of the entire range if the wrong curve is used.Hope this helps?",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=132044&sid=1011956d8606812c50325e5c86863f67#p132044

When I create my own sample with the version 3 Sample Editor, it gets uploaded to the User bank.  If I have a choir sample from the NS3, I can only load it into the Misc bank, not into the existing choir bank, which seems odd to me.My question is, why so many dedicated and exclusive banks?  There are enough slots (100) in each and plenty of room, but are the factory samples specific to the NW2 for some reason?  It seems that an nsmp3 sample should be able to be loaded in any of the banks. It would make sample organization easier if I could load a sample in any bank, or at least change the order of the banks.-dj",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=131960&sid=1011956d8606812c50325e5c86863f67#p131960

125083,11,1011956d8606812c50325e5c86863f67,p130740,Wave 2 First Impressions,800,DJKeys,2020-05-13T00:17:56+00:00,False,,"Updated after more experience.I have been working wih this machine for a few days now just programming sounds for my Top 40 and classic rock stuff.  The instrument is a joy to use, has a great keybed and a rich sound. It is also much larger and heavier than any previous Lead (or the Wave).  It it is nearly the same size and weight as my NS3C.  There is a lot of guts to this thing. In my opinion (as misssoundscape's), this is not a new version of the Wave, but a completely new instrument in its own class with premier DNA from the entire Clavia/Nord family.Getting around is pretty easy, as it has a similar structure to the A1.  Tha Analog waveforms are incredibly useful and you can easily dial in a starting point when programming.  The Shape waveforms are especially notable, as the Osc Control can give you a wide range of sounds on a single waveform.  The unison feature adds real fatness and polyphony is more that I will ever need.The ADSR Envelopes for both the Amp and Filter have the same interaction as a classic subtractive synth.  All oscillators can be detuned up or down and the mod envelope can be set to negative values! The Filter envelope can be inverted as well, which makes for some cool possibilities.Using the A1 as my guide, I was creating sounds quickly and found myself saying, ""wow, that was easy"". I love that the shift and copy/paste buttons are right next to each other. The filters sound great, and being able to adjust the filter envelope amount is a cool bonus. Pretty much every needed parameter can be morphed. Also, the independent Wheel assign section is a great addition. The chorus, phaser, and ensemble sound great, but I have not yet been able to get the sounds I want out of the reverbs (that will take some more experience).  I would rather have two more adjustable Hall reverbs than a Cathedral which I really wouldn't use.I worked with the arpeggiator briefly. It is more advanced than the A1, and gives you the ability to store your own rhythmic patterns (but not your own notes). The solo feature in the Layer section is awesome and saves a lot of time, as you can just push one button to solo any layer when editing.The filter and the amp can both be over driven, but the quality of the sound of the distortion is really dependent on the filter settings and oscillator selection, so I need to experiment with that more. It seems the Drive in the EQ section is weaker than the filter drive.  The EQ drive doesn't seem to increase as you turn the dial, it behaves parametrically in my experience which is much different than my NS3.  I hope Nord can make the EQ drive more powerful going forward.If you load a sample, it has its own pre-programmed filter, so you will need to enable the filter to mangle the sample. The EQ is defaulted to logical frequencies, and the parametric mode allows nice sound tailoring.I also found that if I want to trigger sounds from my NS3 on different sides of a split and the NW2 is split as well, the split points must be the same notes.  Makes sense, but it had me confused for a while (that is not hard to do LOL).The 0.84 manual is still a little behind the curve, as the utility section opens the Arp pattern instead of Layer swap in version 1.02.  I believe things will catch up as the synth is used more and these small discrepancies are resolved. I apologize if my thoughts are a little scattered, as I pieced them together as I worked with the instrument.All in all, this keyboard is very flexible and above all sounds fantastic.-dj",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=130740&sid=1011956d8606812c50325e5c86863f67#p130740

It cannot load the Nord Piano Library samples like the Electro. It can load piano sounds from the Sample library, but, those are very limited compared to the Piano Library, fewer and not nearly as detailed.  The keybed is 61 note semi-weighted waterfall, so it not close to an actually piano action. If money is no issue, keep the A1 and buy the Stage 3 76 or 88, which are both Stage Pianos which are much closer to what you describe.

There were never a lot of synths able to use samples as oscillators, and the Wave is still actually very powerful.The current alternatives are only the Blofeld/Sledge (they share the same engine) which have less than 1/3 the sample memory of the Wave, and much less polyphony.Or the Prophet X/XL which is huge and prohibitively expensive.All in all, the Wave is still a very good option.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=116167&sid=1011956d8606812c50325e5c86863f67#p116167

You have fine tune on OSC2.  Also, in the f/x section you have chorus and can set delay to super fast rate to fatten things up, too.  You should be able to dial something up without samples pretty quickly which will sound good, especially if you load the identical program into both slots A and B, and then bump a few of the aforementioned settings just slightly to create your own custom unison mode.And then to top that off, there are hundreds of synth samples in the Nord Sample Library.  Chances are good that there's a saw or two in there which will speed you along that task.Bless,Pablo",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=44166&sid=1011956d8606812c50325e5c86863f67#p44166

Poll) !!,19256,ResonantMind,2017-03-07T10:52:58+00:00,False,,"I thought I would create a new Nord Wave OS update request (Comon.. Land on V3 please!) and parse post v2.14 requests in here from the original thread. I know this is unlikely since the Wave is discontinued and last update was 2015... But I think doing this would benefit Clavia. It benefits them to keep their synths alive - it's their Synths being used more in YouTube videos, instagram clips, in studios with their clients (potential Nord customers), on stage, in instagram clips, etc, etc. It would also make some users super happy and want to buy more Nord, especially users who only own a Wave like myself.Try to keep features requests realistic based off what has previously been achieved with updates, although admittedly, I'm going to adventure outside that realm a bit likely. These are my personal feature requests of which it seems some others have also requested. I will parse their requests into here as well. I've also created a poll - willing to pay for this update or no?-Feature compatibility with the latest editor/manager features - Samples and programs linked by name instead of location #. Sample missing prompt with search/locate.(This is actually my #1 request because Im doing sample intense projects and this is pretty annoying and is resolved in other synths)-Polyphony limit via 'System' (I have a problem sometimes re-triggering duplications of the same note, eg, if playing a C-Chord, and playing the c note repeatedly, will result in stacked C voices phasing with each other)-Programmable MIDI thru on the output-programmable AfterTouch (this would be done by holding shift + the first C on the keyboard, pressing through to engage aftertouch, and then turning a setting... doing the same but on the first 'D', and turning knob will remove the link)-More expression pedal destinations +PLUS+ Multiple destinations: 'Destination 1', 'Destination 2', 'Destination 3'. That way it can be separate from the morph.-Ability to use sustain pedal as a gate/trigger instead.-allowing the wooden pitch stick to control other things, give it multiple destinations - ie could control filter while pitch shifting, or set pitch amount to '0' so that it just becomes another control.-tap tempo LFO rates by holding shift, and hitting the delay tap tempo - this essentially is a global 1/4 note clock.----^holding shift AND holding tap tempo enters you into a selection mode, where touching any rate or envelope parameter will engage into a division sync mode to the global tap tempo clock. ie, 1/1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8/, 1/16th, etc. So for example, you hold shift and tap tempo. it enters you into the parameter clock division selection mode, you go to LFO1 rate, nudge the knob, now it is engaged into division and on the parameter screen when you move the knob you will see it switch between 1/1, 1/4, etc, etc. If you leave LFO2 alone, it remains free-time/hz.-More vibrato options and programability in the system menu:---Depth level---Aftertouch pressure to depth amount ratio control---Adtertouch pressure to rate option and amount/ratio control---vibrato attack and release envelope with multiple destination options: 'rate', 'depth', 'rate+depth', 'sync to filter-env', 'sync to amp-env'.---Additional ""vibrato modes"", including to use it as an additional LFO (LFO3) source with multiple selectable destinations via 'System Menu':-----^VIBRATO MODES: 'Vibrato', 'TREMOLO', 'LFO3', 'Vib+Trem', 'Vib+LFO3', 'Trem+LFO3', 'Vib+Trem+LFO3'-------^Ability to invert phase of LFO3 from vib/trem.-------^Depth of trem/vib is LFO3 amount - could have a LFO3 amount to depth ratio (1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 5:1, 10:1), as well as '-', '+', and '-/+' amount options.-------^Could potentially have same option for LFO3 rate, a ratio doubler (2:1, 3:1, 5:1, 10:1)------- (((Maybe LFO3 by default is linked to vibrato, but maybe LFO3 is an internal system LFO on it's own, could have independent rate, link to LFO1 or LFO2)))---Sustain pedal turns on vibrato.---Ability to lock current vibrato type to current program, so that it can be turned on/off(bypassed) without cycling the different vibrato types.-Option in 'System' to have empty programs be selectable as default square wave oscillators, ie, completely zero'd but with square waves selected, volume at half, only 'A' on.. I've created a blank-backup of this empty preset for this purpose. It's much quicker workflow when designing multiple ideas.-Naming programs using the keys, when in process of naming a program, holding shift and pressing a key will select a letter. The very first 'A' key-note on the keyboard is almost the perfect distance to the last key-note on the keyboard which would be a 'z' just utilize last two black keys to make it happenso, starting from first A could correspond to the letter A, through to G (A-A, B-B, C-C, D-D, E-E, F-F, G-G | A-H, B-I...and so on)screenshot_20170307_020935.jpg (185.12 KiB) Viewed 8113 times-ability to add our own wavetables through the editor/manager?-ability to expand memory for samples, with some instructions for us DIY'ers. or maybe utilizing the USB slot somehow.I would personally pay $200 to get all this added ^ it's nearly creating an entire new synth.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=82357&sid=c58832068113ca4965d39b62d041454e#p82357

I would like a few other things as well, in order of preference...Please add some SYSTEM settings, that will not break patch compatibility, when the OS gets updated again, since that window has been opened recently.1.  Please add Vibrato Depth to the SYSTEM settings.  I would like the Max depth to be at least double what the current default depth is, the Min could go down to none, so we can add subtle modulation if desired.2.  Please add a SYSTEM setting for Chorus Mix, so we can control how much of the Chorus effect to add to the original signal.  It's a little heavy handed right now, for my tastes.3.  Please expand the SYSTEM Vibrato Rate, I'm not sure why it's currently so limited, open this rate for more creative purposes, maybe 0.2 to 20 Hz?4.  Please add a SYSTEM setting for Reverb Time Multiplier, so we can control the size of the rooms more.  x0.2 to x2.0 should be good, where x1.0 is the default, where the algorithms are currently at.  I'd like to use a bigger selection of smaller rooms, where the reverb adds more space than classic reverb.5.  Please add a SYSTEM setting for Delay Feedback Multiplier, so we have more control over feedback.  x0.5 to 3.0 should be good, where we can get really long feedback if desired.On my crazy wish list, add more filter types and use SYSTEM settings to exchange them out as needed.  I'm trying to think of ways of using the SYSTEM settings so that patch compatibility is not impacted, because after all these years, it's pretty hard to change anything that impacts that.Thanks!alcools wrote:1.

This is important if you are into doing performance patches on the fly, and you want to start from ""zero"" each time.-Skip selection for Osc1/2. Another important feature request for ""performance patching"", being able to select any individual Osc source without having to cycle them all. ie, jumping from Triangle, to FM. This could be achieved by holding down the Osc selection button, causing it to blink, and then you ghost-cycle through to your selection (which doesn't actually cycle through them in the sense of changing Osc sounds/source), once you land on the Osc source you want, you then press and hold again, and it goes straight to that source.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=82364&sid=c58832068113ca4965d39b62d041454e#p82364

Obviously it's highly unlikely, but 10 years is not outside of a products support life cycle for firmware updates. And there potentially could be measurable return - you don't actually know that. It renews interest in a product, makes it relevant today, and potentially gets people interested in the Clavia brand. I've been - less interested - since Clavia stopped producing/supporting the Nord Wave and Modular - so there's measured loss for you.Maybe a public thread such as this one won't lead Clavia to Wave V3 - but maybe it will lead to something else like Nord Eurorack, a Modular G3 with CV in/out.

It is much more likely that this problem is coming from the pitch stick.  Assuming that this is what's happening, it will be necessary to replace the pitch stick.

If/when in doubt or unsure about an operation, DON'T DO IT!  Leave it to a pro.Of course, on Stage it is possible to disable from the front panel, but that would involve editing every program to remove pstick and then re-editing after repair to restore same.

The sampler función is basic for me now (and because i want to load a long wav files as textures i need that the synth sampler have a good cuality sound of the sampler that i preloaded).

The Wave it cost tree times moore as i can see now it only have moore sampler memory and intutive controlls and you can split the keyboard which is great, but i think is too much to cost tree times no?

The wave simply sounds a lot better for samples than the harsher Blofeld.Ease of use: The Wave has a much better sample editor to edit keymaps and transfer samples to the synt.Knobs: The wave has knobs for everything, easy to tweak the samples live.Effects: The effects in the wave, although much more limited than the Blofeld, has knobs for each function and sound A LOT better.Memory: The wave has an insane 180MB of flash RAM... and also uses lossless compression, so in reality you get 540MB of RAM.Sounds: You can use the samples to modulate FM sounds, this sounds amazing and unique, more like a Synclavier/Fairlight or similar.So what are the drawbacks, because there are some.For live it has one MAJOR drawback.It has no splitpoint, yes you read it right, you cannot put two sounds on different parts of the keyboard of the Nord wave....You can however put how many sounds you want on the keyboard as individual samples, by using the sample editor, not exactly the same thing though...For having an ""analog"" synt live, the Nord lead A1 is a lot easier to use in this regard.The keyboard is better in the Blofeld.It has no arpeggiatorIt has no Unison mode, somewhat made up for with an excellent chorus.But for me the samples win, and its possible to use it as for instance Depeche Mode did with their EMAX samplers live,to bring studio sounds live, by assigning them to different parts of the keyboard.Hope this was somewhat helpfull!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=93229&sid=c58832068113ca4965d39b62d041454e#p93229

Truth is, what I had originally typed after ""programming yourself"" was ""instead of whining...""  but that sounded too harsh and would have made me a whiner, too.  Now I'm glad that I didn't shove my whole foot completely down my throat and make a complete ass of myself.  Always better to be half-assed than a complete ass.I think what really happened there is that Nord wrote two factory banks plus perhaps a dozen or so programs into the 3rd bank.  Early Waves were delivered this way.  Then they reached out to some seriously capable programmers around the planet and invited them to write additional programs and that's what those folks came up with.  It's probably true that the programming could be pushed further, but by the time the final factory load was settled...well...then it was time to move on to the next project.My hats totally off to anyone versed in FM programming vagaries.  When the DX7 came out I tried to comprehend programming and quickly failed.  Looked at the D-50 and went the Roland way and never seriously looked back at those FM vagaries.

Excuse my vague formulation. My sample sounds (that you can upload or delete with the Nord Sound Manager on your computer, as you know) are all collected under ""MellotronLayerXT"", Acoustic, 1:82. You switch between the samples with the OSC2 lever, and it has 53 available slots. The thing is, the samples must have the mod wheel (the granite lever) turned all the way up to be heard; as you turn it down, a cello sound increasingly takes over, and it's heard in the background even as the mod wheel is turned all the way up, so there's a dual-sound going on and apparently no way of getting rid of the cello, which is pretty annoying.

It is about MOD ENV destination. A request is: to have one additional destination -> to both OSC1 and OSC2 at the same time.Why this feature:Because it would befinallypossible to do proper FM synthesis with both oscillators!! As we all know, Nord Wave has modulation envelope routed to SHAPE2 only.  This cripples the synth to only one useful FM oscillator per slot. I talk about classic FM patches of which 95% require an envelope, instead of an LFO (which is what Wave unfortunately gave us).Second benefit, it would be finally possible to use AD/AR envelope to do classic Sync Osc sweeps. Although it is possible to use LFO2 saw waveform in SINGLE mode to achieve the sync down effect, it is not possible to have different attack and decay rate (if you use triangle LFO) for different kind of Osc Sync effects.Third benefit, it would be finally possible to have PWM and all other effects related to SHAPE knob to be controlled by AD envelope on both OSCs at the same time.All this is achieved by one single additional Mod Envelope slot that is routed routed to OSC1 and 2. Not to mention how much the machine gains soundwise!I am aware of the technical problem - the lack of label on the front panel showing OSC1 and OSC2 in the MOD ENV slot destination. However there are a few options available to overcome this. For example, a new ""slot"" can be indicated to user by either making SHAPE2 triangle led blink (indicating destination is now to both SHAPE1 and SHAPE2) or, if that is not possible, simply by turning all triangle LEDs off in MOD ENV destination list. That would then indicate to the user that SHAPE1 and SHAPE2 are now set at destinations.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=39037&sid=c58832068113ca4965d39b62d041454e#p39037

I just got one a couple of days ago.  These are a few of the things I would like:1. Add Vibrato Level to the SYSTEM menu, I keep wanting to hear a much deeper vibrato on some patches, especially bass, and funkier sounds also need it to go deeper.  I'd rather use the existing vibrato than make use of an LFO for this.2. Add Unison mode to MONO MODE section, clicking the button a third time will light both LEDs and will stack the voices.  If you could add all three modes from the Lead 4, that would be awesome!  Unison 1 - both LEDs on, Unison 2 - both on / MONO LED flashing, Unison 3 - both on / LEGATO LED flashing.  I'm tapping into my experience with adding extensive hacks and features to a Mutable Shruthi and what I had to do to indicate new modes of operation.3. Add velocity curve setting to the SYSTEM menu.  I really want to use this as my new master MIDI controller (because this will also be my primary source of new sounds when I want to quickly whip something up).  The existing curve is nice.  But, I generally play with a lighter touch and would also like something called ""Easy"" where I can use a lighter touch, and then several fixed velocity settings that I generally use to assist me with MIDI sequencing, sound programming and playing velocity-sensitive sounds at their sweet spots.  I don't see a need for a less responsive ""Hard"" curve.  So I would maybe like settings in this order:Velocity Curve:  Normal, Easy, Fixed 64, Fixed 72, Fixed 80, Fixed 88, Fixed 96, Fixed 104, Fixed 112, Fixed 120, Fixed 127.4.  Would it be possible to add a more subtle chorus setting, one that adds a little sense of stereo and depth to a sound, but not so much that the sound suddenly explodes into stereo?  Maybe put that at the end of the CHORUS button push cycle, indicated by a flashing LED 1.I couldn't find much else that I'd want, other than the things that have already been suggested.  A list might help inspire them, to make it more worth their time.  Based on my experience with hacking the code of a Mutable Shruthi, it shouldn't be a big deal to add minor features to a modern digital hardware synth.  Some of the new things might be more ""hidden"" and not reflected by the text on the panel, BUT, there's an entire LCD display to show what's happening, so it's hardly hidden, it's a minor inconvenience at best.  Since this synth really is more of a cult thing at this point, and they probably won't release a Nord Wave 2 (it's not that hard to locate a used Nord Wave), I can't see any reason to not give us an OS upgrade.

And when you consider that the A1 came out 7 years after the Wave, that makes sense.  So while Phillips comments may be true from amodulationstandpoint (which it really isn't because the A1 has four slots, and the Wave only has two -- and yes, I realize that you cannot cross modulate between slots, but similar effects can still be achieved in some cases), from the standpoint ofsound quality, one might say: ""the Wave cannot do anything that A1 can do"".Don't get me wrong, I still love the wave for the ability to add sampled sounds into the mix with  subtractive synthesis....

Please add a SYSTEM setting for Chorus Mix, so we can control how much of the Chorus effect to add to the original signal.  It's a little heavy handed right now, for my tastes.3.  Please expand the SYSTEM Vibrato Rate, I'm not sure why it's currently so limited, open this rate for more creative purposes, maybe 0.2 to 20 Hz?4.  Please add a SYSTEM setting for Reverb Time Multiplier, so we can control the size of the rooms more.  x0.2 to x2.0 should be good, where x1.0 is the default, where the algorithms are currently at.  I'd like to use a bigger selection of smaller rooms, where the reverb adds more space than classic reverb.5.  Please add a SYSTEM setting for Delay Feedback Multiplier, so we have more control over feedback.  x0.5 to 3.0 should be good, where we can get really long feedback if desired.On my crazy wish list, add more filter types and use SYSTEM settings to exchange them out as needed.

I don't have a Wave anymore so I can't check, but it forgot whether you selected sounds (programs) per slot or selected both at the same time. You can certainly copy slots from other sounds, so you could modify program 1:1 and copy slot A from program 1:2 and slot B from program 1:3.You'll need to check the manual for the details.bootch wrote:And another question..

""For example, you could create something that takes a MIDI note message (generated when you press a key) and that sends it to either slot A or B based on where on the keyboard that note was.""This is pretty much a variation on the first of the three options Diego lists.Instead of using an external keyboard, you'd use the keyboard of the Wave but you'd turn Local Control (see the MIDI setting menu) off. You'd then run a cable from MIDI OUT to the input of some smart MIDI device and a cable from the output of that MIDI device back to the MIDI IN port on the Wave.That 'smart' MIDI device would most likely be a computer, so probably not that convenient for live gigs. Technically it could also be some stand-alone MIDI device, but I know of none that can do that.Edit: I forgot about this thing -http://mutable-instruments.net/midipal. It would also provide an arpeggiator and some other neat things for your Wave. You could for instance use the simple step sequencer to play accompaniment on slot B while you're playing on slot A.If using a computer, you'd for example use a DAW like Cubase to receive the MIDI from the Wave, modify it and send it back to the Wave. Alternative utilities could also be used. For example, I think MIDI-OX (a free utility for Windows) could also do this.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=27588&sid=c58832068113ca4965d39b62d041454e#p27588

I bought a second hand Wave a couple of years back (worked fine when I got it and after examination seemed pretty well looked after), played around with it for a bit and used it for a couple of studio related things, but haven't made much use of it for about a year or two, mostly because I just didn't have the time to really dig into synthesis and tap into it, with a host of life issues to deal with. I've recently pulled it out again, and it seems to have developed a fairly specific pitch bend problem.My suspicion is that the strain gauge has gone in one direction (that is, when bending lower). I haven't tested extensively (only for one and two semitones), but the keyboard detunes based on how many semitones I have set for pitch bending (i.e if I have the pitch bend set to 1 semitone, the whole keyboard will be one semitone lower than concert pitch when the pitch bend is in the middle position). It mostly is actually detuned by a perfect semitone, but occasionally (particularly after moving the stick) will seem to be slightly out of tune. The pitch bend responds, albeit sluggishly, when sharpened, but there is no effect when flattened.I've also opened it up just to have a look inside - the actual bend apparatus looks ok, nothing is loose, all the wires are still in place as far as I can see with looking and some very very gentle pulling, and there's no muck or anything inside around the wires or on the gauge itself that would indicate obvious interference. The modulation wheel works fine.So, I figure that what needs to happen is the gauge needs to be replaced. Is it possible to do this as a home job relatively easy (I'm not confident tinkering around that much), is this something I should get a Clavia-authorised dealer to fiddle with (I bought this second hand), or can I safely get a third party to do a job? I could maybe live with the bend, but I would like it working, plus there is occasionally some interference that makes me less than confident the unit can reliably hold concert pitch (even if I adjust the system wide pitch to account for the pitch bend fault offset).Thank you for any input, and if you need more info just ask!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=77106&sid=c58832068113ca4965d39b62d041454e#p77106

( Kick, Snare, and HiHat )I mapped them to 3 individual keys and checked unpitch.Everything sounded perfect in the sample editor.  I imported into the Nord Wave and the samples played back perfectly.  I used three fingers of course to trigger the samples.NOW, I decided to open Cubase 8.5 and combine the three samples into one.  I did this so I could simply use one finger on the Nord Wave to trigger the sample.I repeated the import process in the Sample editor and everything worked and sounded great.However, after importing into the Nord Wave, the sound is now pitched up a couple of octaves in sound.  The sample still resides on a single key, but the pitch and tempo are faster.  All parameters appear to be solid in the Sample editor and the playback is just fine with the software.  It's just the Nord Wave that is not playing it back correctly.  I also haven't tweaked anything at all, rather I've just been playing the OSC Samp as is.  ( If I go back and import the 3 individual samples, they play fine in the Nord Wave.)This is very strange to me and makes me wonder if there is something embedded in the file that is tripping up the Nord Wave.  Cubase must have tampered with the file when I exported it or something.  I can't figure this out.  This sample is still in the original stereo, 44.1, 16 bit format.  Maybe the Sample editor is detecting the wrong root key and even though it plays fine in the editor, the Nord Wave plays it differently according to the detected Root Key.  Some old samplers do this.  Not sure if that makes sense.Has anyone experience pitch/tempo issues with files after editing in 3rd party software?  If I find the problem I'll update my post.

Originally when merging the audio tracks I didn't realize the setting was on Elastique Pro.  The loops I have are premade and set to a BPM of 125, so I didn't really need the Elastique Pro settings.  I then switched all the tracks to Standard-Drums.  I then merged the tracks and exported the audio in stereo out to the desktop.  I also noticed that the previous file I tried was exported to mono, but all the other files in the Nord Wave program were stereo.  Not sure if I can mix mono with stereo files.  That might have been the cause as well.  Not sure.Now when transferring the sample it plays back at the right pitch and tempo.  Note that I did not change any settings on the Nord Wave itself.Anyways, I'm starting to sense the Nord Wave is a bit sensitive to how the samples are process and saved.  I think I need to keep samples as identical as possible per program.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=77052&sid=c58832068113ca4965d39b62d041454e#p77052

It's almost there.  A +1.6dB bump on the Treble control gets it very close after this upgrade, so it's still a little on the dark side (compared to the ULN-8), but nothing that matters much, since it's a synth and not an audio interface.  It was noticeably darker before.  There is no before and after recording, sorry, to document this upgrade is only as useful as the A/D being used during recording, sample rate, good clocking, keeping the audio uncompressed, the D/A used during playback, the accuracy of the monitors, and having your head in the monitor sweet spot, it's hard to prove something squishy.  I made recordings of a similar upgrade to a Yamaha FS1R in the past, posted on gearslutz, and it didn't end up being very helpful for anyone.  It's personal preference in the end, and kind of fun to customize stuff to see what happens.Edit:  With further listening, the +1.6 bump was too high, it's actually only +0.7, so it's just a tiny bit dark really, nothing significant, after the upgrade.Update:  Really loving this upgrade.  You know, I was very close to selling the Wave, thought I'd give an upgrade a try, now I won't sell it, it makes such a difference, being able to hear the sounds with clarity, unmasked, how they should be.

Partially because no one knows if Nord is going to refresh the Wave line (and they don't make new ones anymore), and partially because there may be synths out there that do what the Wave does, only better.Don't get me wrong... I love my bright red synths, but Nord stopped making the Wave a few years ago, so any Wave you buy off eBay / Reverb is almost certainly out of warranty.  That's an added level of risk that needs to be considered when looking to purchase a synth (or anything really)...SO -- what would alternatives to the Nord Wave look like?  Essentially a synth with good Sample Playback, great VA, multi-timbrality and effects.My first thought was the Kurzweil PC3-k6/7/8.   Why?   Sample library with a wide variety of sounds, a VA engine that (while different) seems as capable as the Wave, 16 part multitimbral (128 voice polyphony), and the effects section blows the doors off of the Wave (don't start bitching, I love my Nords too).  Other ""pluses"" for the Kurzweil -- 16 arpeggiators, 16 Riff generators, Computer based patch editor, and the Effects (yes, I mentioned that, but hey, the Kurzweil effects are good enough to list twice).  And their VAST synthesis architecture -- talk about a modulation matrix.OK guys, Go.

I actually have the XF7, but the XF6 is the same of course.  I think the John Melas software makes working with the samples very easy.  I also think the Motif XF has some additional functionality like sample velocity layers, keyboard splits, better ADSR/Effects per sample instead of Global parameters on the Wave.  I also think the price is about the same with the XF6 (nowadays) which gives you much more for your money than the Wave.  Of course the Wave has all those knobs, but you can also map sliders, buttons, and knobs on the XF to alter the sounds of the samples as well.  You can also sample into the XF which you can't on the Wave.  Plus the XF has an multiple arps, a sequencer,an  onboard synth, and a few other bells and whistles.  I'd definitely couple the Nord Lead 2x/3/4/A1 with a Motif ES/XS/XF over the Wave.I also think the Wave was and perhaps still is a very expensive instrument.  I think there are still a lot of people who paid full price still trying to justify their purchase.  This is understandable but still a problem when asking about advice or recommendations.  If someone forks over two grand for a synth, there's no doubt they'll somehow justify that it's an awesome synth.  The Wave really is missing a ton of functionality and every time I check the specs, I find it very difficult to climb aboard the Wave wagon.  I am hoping a Wave 2 comes out because only then will we see a nice drop in price.  We'll see.The Nord Wave is indeed nice, but there are actually a lot of great alternative sample boards out there for similar prices.  In Japan the Wave is hovering around $1500 used which is an amazing resell value.  I think that's more due to the rarity than the value of the Wave quite frankly.  That's definitely in Motif XF, older Kronos, and other synth price territory.Still, the Wave is quite a beautiful sampler for sure.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=64607&sid=e14a1248124fb82b47ca3e5d7edaa915#p64607

Thank Ricoche.I've never really used Yamaha boards, but a quick look at the Motif XF reveals a quality board.  I would likely go with the Kurzweil over the Motif XF.  Not because I think the Kurzweil is that much better sounding or better quality, but because I already know how VAST works -- i.e. zero learning curve for me.  But your right, the Motif warrants serious consideration for anyone looking for an alternative to a Wave.I think I have about decided though... One other consideration I didn't mention earlier -- this is for studio use only.  I don't gig as a keyboard player.  I currently have an NL3, NLA1, and a couple DSI boards.  Hence the look for something that does sample based sounds...  Anyway, I'm probably going to use Omnisphere 2 until Nord or Kurzweil introduce something new that blows my socks off.  I know someone is about to shoot me for mentioning a soft synth, but when your talking sample playback and calculated filters, and soft synth is essentially a keyboard without the metal case and keys.Thanks again for the great suggestions guys.Cheers!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=64620&sid=e14a1248124fb82b47ca3e5d7edaa915#p64620

But remember that you can't alter the organ samples like on the Electro or Stage - no drawbars real or virtual, no way to switch percussion on and off, and the Wave has no Leslie simulator.Single layer just means the same sample every time you play the same note, no matter how hard or soft you play it. Not so important for organ sounds, but your pianos would sound very samey and simplistic. Velocity control of the filter or filter envelope can help a little, but it would be a pale imitation of what the Electro and Stage pianos sound like.Honestly, a Stage 2 is a far better bet for your needs than a Wave.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=52075&sid=e14a1248124fb82b47ca3e5d7edaa915#p52075

Maybe I misunderstood.Either way, as a NS2 owner I recommend it wholeheartedly, but I would agree with you RedLeo about a more fully featured synth in addition. That bumps up the price, but maybe the OP has deep pockets?Worth adding, with the NS2 you have an 'external' section along with Organ, Piano and Synth which means you can plug in a little desktop synth via midi (or a rack unit, or another board, or even a laptop running VSTs if you trust software more than I do!)  and control it from the NS2 with patches changes, volume, params etc. It's a really useful feature IMHO.

You could of course use a USB MIDI cable for easy MIDI access to the Wave. I found the MIDI-over-USB capability of my Stage 2 convenient, but during some testing the Stage 2 was able to sync better to a MIDI clock over MIDI directly than via MIDI-over-USB (maybe due to latency and overhead in USB?). I sent it a 300 BPM MIDI clock (the fastest it could sync too) and even with different MIDI interfaces I got different results; note that these MIDI interfaces themselves were connected via USB too.As for a rack version of the Wave: it would surely make a kick-ass addition to a Stage 1, in combination with the extern section. Include a small mixer and you'd hardly miss the synth section of the Stage 2. If someone really wanted to, they could make a custom case for the Wave and house the contents of a regular Wave minus the pitch stick, modwheel and keyboard in it. You might still need to jury-rig some stuff though, like maybe connect some variable resistors to the pitch stick and modwheel inputs (in case the Wave doesn't boot without those). Might be an interesting project if you happen to find a broken Wave that still works properly via MIDI.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=20506&sid=e14a1248124fb82b47ca3e5d7edaa915#p20506

The reason I'd want one is so I can bring flash ram samples in a synth engine anywhere on a plane. Although the Wave is small enough to put in the overhead bin. But a rack would be even smaller and could fit in a suitcase. A rack Electro 3 with the sample flash ram would also be great for this.

This is contrary to my 5+ years experience handling these things in Canada and the USA.  Firstly, Nord mod wheel failure (it will be the pot when it fails) is extremely rare.  I've only seen 3-4 cases of this across all Nord models in this period of time.  Pitch sticks can and will fail over time, but the Wave has no increased incidence of this behavior over any other Nord model.

I do not wish to delete the factory presets at the moment.I'm having a difficult time doing it with the first Nord Wave synth patch. The first time I turned what seems to be everything off, reset each knob (turned it up then zero'd), set OSC's to just a single wave, LFO's and MOD ENV to zero's, I ended up with a sound that was very clearly still modulated by an oscillator and not a pure signal. The second time I did the same thing I lost most of the volume, and was only able to bring it back by turning up the FREQ knob under FILTER. It almost seems like when I turn the OSC all the way down while playing the instrument and the signal is hitting the bottom of the curve, it will stay there. This is becoming very counterintuitive to me.Is there an easier way to do this? And on a second note, is my Wave malfunctioning or is there a bug?

I understood that the Lead 3 and the A1 might not bring to me a lot compared to my 2X, even if I know that your set up is made with A1+2X....And then, according again to the answers and posts I got on this forum, I will add on top of my C2 a Prophet 08 that could bring me the more pure ""analoguish"" sound that one guy was referring as the main valuable characteristic of the A1....So, that's why I was thinking about this synth but I will always stay in my usual range of music, Jazz, jazz rock, fusion, rock, rhythm and blues, vangelis/Jarre kind of music and that""s it....For example the last song I worked on is Run For Cover, David Sandborn/Marcus Miller....using the Stage for E.Piano. Organ, Strings and Harp arpeggio, matrix 1000 for bass, Proteus 2000 and XV5080 for brass, and DE50 for another layer of strings....And also, even If I think that 990$ now for a White Moog Little Phatty seems to be a good deal I still have issue with monophonic synth when I could have a polyphonic one for 200 $ more with the Wave....So, you have it now, thanks for your reply...",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=49328&sid=e14a1248124fb82b47ca3e5d7edaa915#p49328

Not sure how others do it but this works for me:Set your external instrument to Midi channel : All in logic.On the wave in midi settings :Local : offMidi channel: Bi timbMidi control A : 2Midi control B : 3( I seem to remember that if these Midi control channels are set to channel 1 it wouldn't work for some reason.)MIdi control mode : send and receive.Midi prog change mode : send and receive.Now if you go into logic. you should be able to record your part, and all controls will be included for the slot which is selected.To record further automation, you can go ahead and record over the same region again if you have ""merge with selected regions"" selected. (don't try to control the wave using the automation view in logic, it doesn't work).I recommend recording the notes and opening a ""new track with same channelstrip / instrument"". Then you can record all your control changes neatly in this one track. Open hyper editor to see the events.  To do this go to Hyper - create multiple event definitions. This is the best place to edit your automation.Again, you cannot automate the wave automation from the automation view in logic. (in my experience).This took me a heap of trial and error, but it works.Finally i find that by hitting record, and then hitting the program button on the wave to bring up my sond can get logic to set the correct program on the wave at the start of the track. This is handy. Also you can hit record and dump the control settings. I think this works too. I think you can also tap in the delay time and it will send a control signal out which is the next best thing to being able to sync to midi.  Haven't had time to experiment too much on this tho.Basically if you are recording, anything you do on the wave will be recorded. Remember to save a back up of your sounds into your logic project folder.cheers",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=49442&sid=e14a1248124fb82b47ca3e5d7edaa915#p49442

Do you have any solutions then?Well, if you could use a utility to show the MIDI data coming from your Nord, you could see what's being generated for the pitch bender. When in rest it should always return to roughly the same value; it might move around a bit, but probably not much. Pitch bend is a 14-bit MIDI value, so has a range from 0 to 16383 - in rest it should be roughly in the middle, so  just under 8200.On Windows you could useMIDI-OXand on a Mac you could useMIDI Monitor. If you have both, you might want to do it on the Mac; MIDI Monitor is a bit simpler than MIDI-OX.If you see the pitch bender do strange stuff, like initially settle around 8200 in rest, but go up (or down) to quite different values in rest after a while (9000-10000 for example) you definitely have issues with the pitch stick. I'm pretty sure there's no way to fix it, but it can be replaced. The 'sensor' in there consists if a metal strip that gets bend; when it does so, it changes (I think) resistance and that's what gets transformed into the pitch bend values. If you really hammer the pitch stick, it might get damaged a bit; do this enough times and it might go bad. In any case, they do wear out after quite a bit of use, but I have no idea how quickly they'd do that. I would guess that on most Nords the pitch stick never gets replaced during their lifetime.Btw. I think Darren meant that when the Wave starts up, it measures the current (electrical) value of the pitch stick and assigns the 'middle pitch bend' value to it (8192). If it does that (and it does sound like a smart thing to do), that would mean it gets initialized at startup.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=26920&sid=e14a1248124fb82b47ca3e5d7edaa915#p26920

Apparently your strain resistors have failed in different ways (or one failed and the other not -- isn't four quarter tones roughly equivalent to one tone? )There are four pitch stick leads each of which need to be soldered to the panelboard, after desoldering and removing the four leads of the existing pstick of course.  It ain't rocket science, but then again you'll want someone with soldering skills to handle this for you.  Don't want to endanger your panelboard PCB by having an amateur perform surgery on it.

It seems that using the two slots is my only option? On that point, I'm really battling to figure out how to programme those slots. I have turned the factory memory block off, but am still struggling.

All I can see is, that it is not specifically excluded. The morph function is explained in general, followed by a table of morph destinations. This table also mentions delay amount as a possible destination.Also, the Wave does behave like it should be possible and valid: I hold down the velocity morph button and move the delay amount knob up. The green light next to it lights up and the display shows the morph range. When the velocity morph button is released the green led stays lit.I just do not hear any delay - no matter how strong I play. It just seems to have no effect at all.The same thing happens with keyboard morph. I can set a morph range on the delay amount, but it does not have any noticeable effect over any range of the keyboard.I understand that delay, tube amp and reverb are global effects and not per note. But that is why I was curious about it even more. I just fear that morphing the delay amount via velocity is something Clavia did not assume anyone would want to do.

If you want to prevent the Blofeld from switching programs, you need to have it in multi mode. Press shift + 'Sound / Multi' and then press Play (below the section knob) to switch between selecting a multi program and editing one (you'll see it change in the display). You can then scroll to the right using the selection knob until you see a setting called 'Prg Change' on the bottom-right.

And did the amp short-circuit and die, or is it still (partially) working?The only connection between the Wave and the amp was the output cables from the Wave, right? They may have been connected to the same power, but the power supply in the Wave has some filtering and that fuse, so I don't think the Wave was damaged via the power cable. Still possible of course.Do you know what input the Wave was connected to? Was it a mic input that can provide phantom power? I can imagine the thing put phantom power on the jacks the Wave was connected to; I don't think the Wave would like that. It would like it even less if the voltage was even much higher than the 48 volts provided by phantom power.The Nords have EMI filters (with surge protection) on the outputs. You can clearly see them in this image of my Nord Rack 3.I've put a yellow box around one; there are 17 in the image. The thing directly to the right of the one singled out is a capacitor - it has Cxx next to it, while the EMI filters are shown as Fxx.If you still had it (and had a multimeter), you could check if those EMI filters were still okay (= they conduct with very low resistance). Of course, if the Wave doesn't even start up anymore, there's little use.If the Wave somehow got damaged via the outputs, a DI box might have prevented this. On the other hand, so should the EMI filters I think.As Mr_-G- mentions, visual inspection of fuses doesn't alway work that well. The best way to check them would be with a multimeter; a 12V lightbulb, a 9V battery and 1-2 bits of electrical wire would also work.I hope you get it fixed soon",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=26764&sid=2459477edf67394aed0d517376ba59f8#p26764

I dont want to use soft synths, just the sounds from the wave.You need to record both a MIDI and audio track at the same time; setting that up might just turn out to be the most complex part.If you just want Nuendo to record an audio and MIDI registration of your playing, you don't really need to set up anything special on your Wave. The audio and MIDI might be slightly out of sync (probably not very audible, but the audio is probably going to lag behind the MIDI slightly) but that's likely not a big issue. You could turn Local Control off on your Wave and configure Nuendo to receive MIDI from your Wave and send that back to the Wave to generate the audio. The advantage of this would be that Nuendo could largely correct for the sync issues and you could use your Wave as a MIDI keyboard for Nuendo.I would keep it simple to start with though.Nawave wrote:at least i'd like to know if what im asking is possible.I would think so, yes.

With this setting, the mod wheel controls the amount of vibrato. I think you need to set the maximum amount in the system menu - I think it is set to 5.6 Hz by default.A more flexible way would be to set up LFO1 to modify the pitch of OSC1 or LFO2 to modify the pitch of either OSC1 or OSC2. Ideally you'd use a sine waveform for the LFO, but since that is not available the triangle wave will have to do. You can then assign a wheel morph for the amount knob, so you can control the amount of vibrato added. Unfortunately the Wave doesn't have two mod wheels (and an expression pedal is considered the same as the wheel, I think), but you could use velocity or aftertouch to control the rate of the LFO.There's a potential problem with the second way of doing this: I forgot whether the LFOs are unipolar (0 up to N), or bipolar (-N up to N).(Image is from this Wikipedia page:Sound Synthesis Theory: Modulation Synthesis)Imagine the correct pitch for the sound is at 0. For correct vibrato, I think the pitch would oscillate (ha!) around the original pitch, which would happen with a bipolar LFO (the one on the right). However, if the LFO would be unipolar, the sound would go up a bit, and then go back down the the original pitch (the one on the left). If you lower the amount to 0, both sounds would settle on the original pitch though (the line at 0).I suppose the one on the left would sound slightly different from the one on the right, if you have good ears. I haven't tried it though. Even worse: I don't have a Wave anymore, so can't try any of the advice I'm dishing out.Edit:Now that I think about it, I think the LFOs are probably bipolar. I know my Virus TI has both uni- and bipolar LFOs, but having unipolar LFOs is probably fairly rare on a synth. Envelopes however are normally unipolar (they only increase the value they're controlling, not both increasing and lowering it like an LFO).",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=35384&sid=2459477edf67394aed0d517376ba59f8#p35384

The fact it crashed during the update may have made matters worse, but I can't say that for sure.I think the instability issue must be caused by some issue with analog electronics, such as perhaps some components in the power supply. What you describe with the display might be explained by the main processor not starting up properly anymore; this may have been caused by the crash during the firmware update. When a display like that starts up, it displays those bars and initializing the display (which gets rid of those bars) is normally one of the first things the processor would do (which is why I think it isn't starting up properly).Since you're in the US, I suggest contacting the people doing Nord tech support for the US and Canada directly.

From your earlier message I understood it didn't do a thing anymore.Maybe you can test something: turn on your Wave and plug in a vacuum cleaner very close to the Wave (ideally in the same power socket, maybe via an extension cord). Then start turning the vacuum cleaner on and off a few times and see if the Wave resets.If it does reset, it is caused by a power issue, which could either be the power supply in the Wave or more generally the power in your house; specifically, I suspect shortbrownouts. If it has no impact I think it is not the power supply that is causing this.My Nord Lead 3 resets with the test I describe above; you can find quite a number of posts of people having similar issues, especially in the US (maybe the 110 volt is a factor in this?). Anyway, in practice I've never had my NL3 reset on my, but I can cause it to. If I plug the vacuum cleaner into another wall socket 1-2 meters away from the NL3, I can still measure the effect of turning the vacuum cleaner but it no longer is big enough to cause the NL3 to reset.I really think you need to get your Wave serviced; posting here it crashed won't get anything fixed, but of course you're free to do so",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=33216&sid=2459477edf67394aed0d517376ba59f8#p33216

I had one in the past and I seem to recall it did send aftertouch data. Of course, I might just be wrongAccording to the MIDI implementation chart on page 62 of the manual, it should send aftertouch data:You could also verify this by plugging a MIDI cable from the MIDI out to the MIDI in port and then turning Local Controlloff. You should then still be able to play the Wave (including the use of aftertouch) and if you remove the MIDI cable (or disconnect one end), it should immediately stop responding (unless you didn't turn Local Control off).As for the 'keys' versus 'channel' in the chart; the Wave (like most keyboards with aftertouch) implements aftertouch (pressure) per 'channel', not per key. That means that there's only one pressure (aftertouch) sensor (strip) for the entire keyboard. I have an old Roland A-80 88-note MIDI controller and that one actually implements aftertouchper key, not per channel, but that's rare.If your Wave really isn't sending aftertouch data, are you sure that the aftertouch strip still works on your Wave? That might be an explanation. For example, maybe the sensor broke, the sensor cable itself got damaged or the connector connecting it to the mainboard disconnected?Edit: I don't think these settings matter in this case, but you might want to set these setting to the default setting and try again (page 60 of the manual):MIDI Ctrl A ChannelMIDI Ctrl B ChannelMIDI Control Change Mode",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=34076&sid=2459477edf67394aed0d517376ba59f8#p34076

The Nords will repitch samples if you press a key for which a sample isn't present and normally you won't really be able to hear this, especially if you're not playing it as a solo instrument.I've used Ableton Live for sampling multiple notes in a repeatable way. I just draw a single note in the 'piano roll' and then copy and transpose that note, with say one note per 1-2 bars (depending on how much release it has, etc). I do this so I can easily seperate the notes later on since every sample will start at the start of a bar and will have a fixed length; silence at the end of a sample compresses very well and is not a big issue. If you're clever, you can create samples with have an attack portion, a sustain (which can be repeated by the Nord) and a release. By scaling the velocities, you can easily create sets of samples recorded at multiple velocities.I'm sure you could do something like this with most DAW software. You could investigate SampleRobot, which is an application which is pretty much meant for doing stuff like this in an automated fashion. I thought doing it in a DAW was efficient enough though.Edit: I just noticed this is in the Wave section, not Stage or Electro. Given the fact that the Wave can do so much more with samples than the Stage 2/Electro, I think a clean set of samples of the oscillators of different synths is a great thing to have. For example, you could sample the oscillators of vintage synths (if you have access to those). Using those, the Wave can sound a bit like those synths of old. The similarity is limited though, since the specific sound of the filter is a big part of the sound of a synth (even digital ones) and you won't get that with oscillator samples. You can of course sample notes including filter sound (i.e. sounds with an filter envelope applied to them), but applying the Wave's own filters to samples like that (which already were affected by a filter) can sound weird and 'wrong'.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=32578&sid=2459477edf67394aed0d517376ba59f8#p32578

It probably has the latest version though.You would indeed use the factory sound backup from the CD, though you could also download it from the Nord site (Wave download section) in case you can't find your CD or something like that.Assuming you've already got the Nord Sound Manager installed, you can just fire that up and choose to restore a backup; I think it's one of the buttons in the top-right of the window. Before restoring the factory sounds you could create a backup of what you currently have on there, if you wanted to, but that's not required.If I remember correctly restoring a complete backup takes about 15 minutes. After it's done you can restart your Wave, but you don't have to but you do want to switch to a different program since the one the display will be showing after the restore operation might not exist anymore on the Wave.This is a pretty simple and a risk-free thing to do, provided you don't have any sounds on there you want to keep. As mentioned it does take a while though.Edit: you could install the newest version of the Sound Manager (currently v6.26) if you have an older version, but if you have version 5.x I wouldn't bother. The newer versions have quite a bit of new functionality that isn't implemented on the Wave (bit of a shame, really) that makes managing programs and samples easier. While the new 6.x version works just fine with the Wave, since it doesn't support the new functions the 5.x version are just as good for the Wave.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=26649&sid=2459477edf67394aed0d517376ba59f8#p26649

The Evolver can sound very analog like the Prophet, but also very digital (more like a Waldorf, I think). The Evolver also has a lot of options for distorting sounds in a number of ways, including with multiple delays, a high-pass filter and a bit crusher. It does wavetables too. The prophet does have double the polyphony though (8 v.s. 4 voices).The Mopho/Tetra/Mopho x4 have two advantages over the original Prophet '08: a more convenient feedback mechanism and (more important) each voice has a sub-oscillator. The gives them a bit beefier sound than the Prophet '08. In general though, I think the Moog synths (Minimoog Voyager/Little Phatty/Slim Phatty) sound more 'solid' though; there's something really pleasing about their ladder filter.For the Sledge Studiologic designed the case and the keybed and Waldorf supplied the synth engine. I would probably prefer the Waldorf Blofeld myself (will likely have more features), but the Sledge has a better control surface and is much more hands-on. The Blofeld has quite a bit of menu diving. I'd expect the Sledge to do a few things the Blofeld can't; vice versa, the Blofeld will probably do a lot of stuff the Sledge can't (it seems to have less features than the Blofeld).The Jupiter 50/80 are the most expensive of the bunch (maybe with the exception of the Poly Evolver). They seem pretty interesting, but more geared towards 'natural' sounds, even though they can make nice sounding (virtual) analog-type sounds. I have no experience with these. Scott Tibbs make them sound very nice in his demos, but his demos also convince me this is not the synth for me.I like complex synths (lots of programming options) that can sound sharp/harsh. The Poly Evolver and the Blofeld fit the bill well here.I've owned a Blofeld module, DSI Poly Evolver (both rack and keyboard, don't ask), Moog Little Phatty, Roland Fantom G and a Nord Wave. I would rank the quality of the hardware (how sturdy, etc.) like this:Nord WaveRoland Fantom GDSI Poly Evolver (even though I had the encoder-issue)Moog Little Phatty (the keys felt really, really cheap and the interface worked really well)Waldorf Blofeld module (very solid case, but the knobs wobble a bit and I've had crashes)Quality-wise (sturdiness, how the knobs and buttons felt) I'd say the Nord and the Roland were pretty close.Looking at sound and (programming) features, this would be my ranking:DSI Poly EvolverWalford BlofeldNord WaveMoog Little PhattyRoland Fantom G(Not really fair for the Fantom G - it is a workstation and not a virtual-analog, but the pianos sounded o so plastic to me compared the Stage 2.)For me there was quite a bit of distance between the Blofeld and the Wave. Note I like messing with sequencers, etc. Something like the Wave is really a player's board; my playing skills weren't nearly enough to make it shine. The Nord and the DSI definitely had the best user-interface (knobs, knobs, knobs).If I were to include the Access Virus TI, it'd score slightly higher than the Nord on quality. Sound-wise, I'd probably score it between the Evolver and the Blofeld; the Virus and the Blofeld can sound pretty similar.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=23624&sid=2459477edf67394aed0d517376ba59f8#p23624

It also has effects like reverbs, delay, etc.The Wave has a much broader sonic pallet than the Wave, but if you're looking for a classic virtual-analog the Lead 2X might be a better choice (the Wave can make the same sounds, but the Lead 2X has 4 slots instead of two).

Especially if you're new to synth programming, it might be extremely helpful in order to understand the different functions, like how to effective use the oscillator's shapes do or how to modulate and cross-modulate.If you're reluctant to clear your entire synth, then there is a scaled-down alternative that might fit your needs:On my Wave, I saw no point in keeping all those Mellotrons in my Library. The sound just doesn't fit my style, and the corresponding samples took a lot of space on the Wave.So if you don't need those Mellotrons, start by deleting the presets along with the corresponding samples. They are easy to find and won't break your other presets. After that, you've got a lot of sample memory free to fill!But honestly, the Wave's ability to use samples isn't what makes it really great. I find the combination of synth methods, like VA and FM, to produce marvellous results that are much more difficult to achieve in other synths.EDIT: I had overread you actually liked the Mellotron sounds, apologies!

Thanx!I think users (including myself) have been predicting a Nord Wave 2 for a while but many existing Wave users will ask you why do we need a Wave 2 when the Wave can do so many things really well. It's a tough call for Nord as the world seems to be moving towards software based synths using touch screen operating systems such as the Ipad. However, Apple's decision to make a fundamental change from 30-pin to 'lightining' connector emphasises how fragile the market can be when two essential components are run by different companies and could render such equipment obsolete too early and damage reputations.The NAMM show is coming up on 24-27 Jan 2013 and this is usually the place to release new gear. I am not convinced we will ever see a Nord Wave 2 and that is why I have started looking at other 'synth' hardware equipment including the Access Virus Ti2 and more recently at the Waldorf Blofeld keyboard. When you start looking at other equipment you also begin to realise that the grass isn't always greener and each hardware will have its own flaws and users requesting improvements - in fact people are requesting a Virus Ti3 so this might be one to keep an eye on at NAMM. I recently had my eyes opened to the Waldorf Blofeld keyboard and although now relatively old seems to be a pretty decent synth available for about a third of the price of a Ti2 and a Wave.Ultimately it depends what you want the synth to do. I was very interested in the Wave before I bought my Stage 2 and the synth section on the Stage is very impressive despite the obvious limitations. Nord should be congratulated for extracting so much for users to play with. Ultimately though, despite the very nice filters and some exquisite sounds designed to cater for stage use, it's not the sort of synth if you want complex modualtion routings.In reality we would never buy anything if we constantly waited for the next upgrade and at some point you just have to make a decision and decide what is best for you from equipment available at that time. I am certainly going to wait until after the January 2013 NAMM show and then make a decision shortly thereafter. They key thing is to try and test the equipment you intend to buy beforehand.Geoff",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=25434&sid=2459477edf67394aed0d517376ba59f8#p25434

If slot B makes sound, that's because the Wave received MIDI on it's global channel; B is making sound because it is enabled and is getting notes via the global channel (ch 1) even though B itself is on ch 3 and isn't getting any MIDI notes directly.

What I suggest is that you connect the cable you had in the Wave's MIDI IN port to the MIDI IN port on that interface. You then run a free utility (MIDI-OX on Windows and MIDI Monitor on Mac) that will show you what's being sent to that MIDI port. You'll likely see note on/off messages on either channel 1 or 2 that happen when you press a key on the Wave. The next step would be to plug the cable connected to the MIDI OUT port on your external equipment (that might very well be the one you pulled out of the Wave's MIDI IN port) and test if you also see those messages coming out of that MIDI OUT port.What kind of synth is that other piece of external equipment?

I just had a look at the iConnectMIDI interface and that can doa lotof stuff it seems. Also, I'm convinced now that it's that interface that is causing this. It isn't merely a simple MIDI interface, it can do all kinds of fancy stuff with MIDI (filtering, routing, bridging between different types of MIDI connections without needing a computer) - I can see why you used the term 'network'.Here's a snippet from the information page about it:MIDI Bridge(no computer required)- bridge between USB MIDI 1.0 devices and classic MIDI DIN devices- bridge between multiple USB MIDI 1.0 devicesMIDI Merge- merge two or more MIDI input ports to a single output port- maintains small overflow buffer for each port to handle flux of events- configurable for multiple merge routesMIDI Thru- send a MIDI input port to one or more output port- configurable for multiple thru routes- by default, iConnectMIDITM will pass all MIDI ports to all other MIDI portsMIDI Mute on Input- mute unwanted events from a particular MIDI input from getting into the system.- mute by event groupsMIDI Mute on Output- mute unwanted events from being sent to specific MIDI outputs from the system.- mute by event groupsMIDI Route- intelligent MIDI data routing and managementConfiguration Storage- when you have iConnectMIDI configured to just how you want it, save the configuration into internal memory - settings will be used on next power up - no computer required.I see several items that might be causing issues.

You'd need an Apple iPhone or iPad to use it.This is the information page about it on the Apple site:https://itunes.apple.com/app/portmanage ... 17287?mt=8The manual has this to say on page 28:The default configurationA default configuration exists for iConnectMIDI in the absence of a customized configurationusing the port configuration software and in the absence of a computing device.By default, allUSB ports send to all other ports except themselves, but MIDI DIN ports send to all other portsincludingthemselves.If I read this correctly, it means  that all MIDI received on the standard MIDI ports (DIN 5 plugs) is sent back out again on all other ports (both USB and DIN 5)includingthe port it came from. In other words, the interface 'echoes' MIDI data it receives from the Wave back to the Wave.What if you set the Wave's 'global channel' (that's not what it's called on the Wave, that's the name they use on the Stage 2 - it makes more sense to me though) to, for example, channel 1, slot A to 9 and slot B to 10? In other words, make sure the 'MIDI Channel' (as the manual calls it) uses a different channel than both  'MIDI Ctrl A/B Channels'. The interface would still send back MIDI notes to the Wave, but they will be received on channel 1 (since that is what they were sent on) and should be ignored, since slots A and B are listening to channels 9 and 10 (respectively). You could of course use the same channel for A and B, if you need that.Of course, this is just a work-around. If the way the interface works now bugs you, changing the config so it works the way you want it to would be the way to go, but that does require access to an iPhone or iPad.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=23978&sid=2459477edf67394aed0d517376ba59f8#p23978

However, I'm still tryingI think it works like this:If MIDI Channel is set toBi-Timb, the Wave more or less treats the two slots as independent synthesizers, which each have their own MIDI channel as set by the MIDI Ctrl A/B Channel option in the MIDI menu. They could use the same MIDI channel, but it makes more sense to give them a different one; if you really wanted both slots to make sound at the same time, it seems more logical to me to assign a channel to the MIDI Channel setting (instead ofBi-Timb) and set slots A/B toAuto.If the MIDI Channel is not set toBi-Timbbut has a MIDI channel assigned to it, the Wave takes MIDI data arriving on the channel assigned to the MIDI Channel option, then uses the state of the Slot A/B enable buttons to determine which slot should receive those MIDI messages and then sends them.With option I, you send MIDI to the channels configured for the individual slots. Again, since you're treating them as different synthesizers, it makes most sense to use different slots for them.Youselect which slot makes sound by sending MIDI to the right channel.With option II, you send MIDI to the 'global channel' (I should call this 'MIDI Channel' on the Wave) andthe Wave itselfdetermines where it needs to be sent to, based on whether a slot is active and/or enabled.If I understand the manual correctly, the following should be correct:In both case I and II,if you turn knobs on the Wave or press keys, it sends MIDI on the channel configured for the active slot. In other words: if you have slot A set to channel 10 and slot B set to channel 11, playing on the Wave with slot A active will send on channel 10 and with slot B active will send on channel 11.This seems a bit strange to me, as I would expect it to send on the 'global' channel, not on the channels assigned to the slots (that's the way it works on the NS2). The manual also says the following:Nord Wave manual, page 60 wrote:Since the Nord Wave with the two slots have more physical controls than there are available MIDI CC addresses, this and the following option allows you to transmit and receive the knobs and buttons from the two slots, on separate MIDI channels .That makes sense (even though the sentence is a bit crummy): on the NS2 a section in a slot has maybe 10-15 controls. On the Wave, each slot has 70+ controls. So I think that what I described above is correct; since I don't have a Wave anymore I can't test it. Someone with a MIDI interface connected to a computer (hint, hint) could easily test this though.I'd like to say a thing about slots beingenabledandactive(hopefully this is completely unnecessary):if the LED for a slot blinks, it isactive(only a single slot can blink/beactiveat the same time)theactiveslot isalwaysenabledif the LED for a slot is off, it is notenabled(and of course notactive)if the LED for a slot is on and doesn't blink, it isenabled(but notactive, the other one is)if slot A is blinking and slot B isonwithout blinking, both slots areenabledand slot A isactive; if you then press the button for slot B, A will stay on (enabled) but stop blinking (it is no longer theactiveslot) while B will now start blinking (it is new theactiveslot)OscBombs wrote:I can now successfully turn local to ""off.""

Here's the result I'm going for:I want the Nord Wave keyboard (MIDI Channel 4) to transmit note on, note off, and velocity messages to the Tempest (and only the Tempest). This is successful as I have it set up. To do this, I have the Nord Wave MIDI Channel set to 4, and the Tempest Synth IN Channel set to 4. I also have Local turned to ""off"" (successfully!) so that I am only playing the Tempest.I want my Akai controller (MIDI Channel 10) to send note on, note off, and velocity messages to both Nord Wave Slot A and Slot B simultaneously. This is NOT successful as I have it set up. To do this, I have the Akai sending MIDI on Channel 10 (I can confirm because I am able to play the Tempest via the Akai when the Tempest is set to Channel 10). The Nord Wave is set to Channel 10 for MIDI Ctrl A and MIDI Ctrl B.I want all of this so that I can: (1) use the 4 octaves of the Nord keyboard to play the Tempest, while I (2) use the Akai controller's arp with the Nord sample sounds....Per your suggestion about hooking this up with my DAW (Logic), shouldn't this be possible without that?

Connect your Wave via a MIDI interface to your Mac. For this test, set up the 'MIDI Channel', 'MIDI Ctrl A Channel' and 'MIDI Ctrl B Channel' each to a different channel (for example, channels 1, 2 and 3).Test case 1:make sure 'MIDI Channel' is set to a channel (such as 1), not 'Bi-Timb'. Make slot A active and turn a knob, then make slot B active and turn a knob. On which channel(s) are you receiving MIDI CC messages for turning that knob?Test case 2:make sure 'MIDI Channel' is set to 'Bi-Timb'. Make slot A active and turn a knob, then make slot B active and turn a knob. On which channel(s) are you receiving MIDI CC messages for turning that knob?If I understand it correctly, in the 2nd case you should see channel 2 for slot A and channel 3 for slot B (if you used the channel numbers as in my example). What I wonder about is whether in the first case the data will be coming from channel 1 (for both slots), or from channels 2 and 3 (like in the 2nd case).Btw. 'MIDI Monitor' is a small, free utility for the Mac - download it here:http://www.snoize.com/MIDIMonitor/. MIDI-OX would be an alternative for Windows (it can do a lot more than MIDI Monitor).Anyway, you seem to be doing the right thing, yet is doesn't work. Can you confirm the Nord makes sound if you send it MIDI (on channel 10) via your Computer?You could maybe send something to the Nord via Logic, or you could do it with the 'Audio MIDI Setup' utility of your Mac. Make sure you see the MIDI window; go to the Window menu at the top of you screen and choose 'Show MIDI Window' if you don't see it. If you have your MIDI interface connected, but it isn't shown; hit the Rescan MIDI button. Now, click on the correct MIDI interface and press the 'Test Setup' button. If I remember correctly, this utility then sends some simple note messageson all channels, so you should definitely hear sound from the Wave.Note you can also use MIDI Monitor to 'spy' on MIDI connections. For example, if you have it running while doing that test with the Audio MIDI Setup utility, you should see it send MIDI on all channels for the selected interface.If the test isn't working as expected, you may need to add an 'external device'. Press the Add Device button. Now click on the small triangle pointing down below the MIDI interface (this is the MIDI OUT port); keep the mouse button pressed down and 'draw' a line from MIDI OUT to MIDI IN (triangle pointing down, into the external device). You can also do the MIDI IN port of the interface, but you shouldn't have to. Then try again.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=24231&sid=2459477edf67394aed0d517376ba59f8#p24231

The Wave doesn't have a built-in sequencer, nor an arpeggiator for that matter. However, if you have some other sequencer (such as software running on you computer), the Wave can certainly do stuff like this.The Wave is 18-note polyphonic (so you can have 18 notes sounding at the same time). It is also bi-timbral, so you can use two different sounds at the same time (slot A and slot B); the 18-note polyphony is automatically spread out over the two slots so you could for instance play the sound in slot A on the keyboard and have an external sequencer use the sound in slot B for accompaniment.Edit: if you were to configure both slots to be in mono mode, the Wave would very much work like that Oberheim; it would then be limited to a single note per slot (voice), just like the Oberheim.

The Kaoss Pad series (e.g., KP3) from Korg can be used for that prety intuitively, plus allows a wide range of effects and manipulating of the ""background sequence"" which should make it really easy to achieve something like in the video you showed. This last option is probably what I would go for in this case, plus it is also very affordable.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=23997&sid=2459477edf67394aed0d517376ba59f8#p23997

Since you use samples, you can make it sound whatever way you want it to - it's just the workflow is focussed on beats and bass. I suppose that's the case with a lot of mainstream made-for-radio music these days.There are several models of Electribes, but the most modern ones are the MX and SX. The MX (blue) is more or less a virtual-analog synth combined with a sequencer; the SX (red) loads small samples but is otherwise pretty much the same as the MX. You could see then as sketchpads. The MX sounds a bit thin, but you can really quickly make beats, add animated effects, etc. You can sequence external gear, but if that's your sole goal, you might as well go for an older (2nd hand) version.The Kaoss Pad is firstly an effects unit; it can do all kinds of cool stuff to audio you put through it. The effects aren't the best, but the interface is very much meant for live performance and you could consider it an instrument in its own right. There's also the Kaoscillator Pro, which is similar but instead of being an effects unit, it's a (fairly simple) synthesizer. Personally I think the Kaoss Pad is the most interesting of the two. There's also the Mini Kaoss Pad 2, which is even more portable (can run on batteries), very small but still has a nice feature set.samcell wrote:also I’m interested what you think aboutDoepfer Dark Time Sequencer? because it’s not too expensive and works like first threeThat's certainly an interesting one.

In other words, the keyboard, pitchbend and the modwheel should just work fine.The Phatty doesn't have splits, but the Prophet likely does (on my Poly Evolver I could achieve something like splits with combos). Since the Wave doesn't have splits, the combination of a Prophet '08 module and the Wave also won't have splits. Also, turning a knob on the Wave (like filter cut-off) might not necessarily change the same parameter on the Phatty/Prophet (filter cut-off might not be a good example, since it's a pretty standard one).Anyway, given both modules have pretty much all controls built into it, I think it'll work very well. As a MIDI controller however the Wave doesn't add much more functionality than the Electro, with the exception of the pitchstick and the modwheel.Btw. since the sequencer in the Prophet can generate MIDI (95% sure it can), it should also be able to control the Wave.Edit: I've used my Wave as a keyboard for my Waldorf Blofeld.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=23881&sid=2459477edf67394aed0d517376ba59f8#p23881

Of course, the Wave has most of the Lead heritage too and thus the overlap with Blofeld.What Blofeld adds over the Lead is LOTS and LOTS of modulation options, excellent wavetable support (something most Waldorf synths are very good at), support for custom samples (the Wave can do more with them though) and the awesome comb filter. The very deep synth engine lets you make really complex sounds, but it is also one of its downfalls: the firmware isn't super stable, the interface (even though it works fairly well) is rather complex and involves lots of menu diving and it is rather hard to get it to sound other than digital (though I've heard it done).One of the awesome things about the Nords is the immediacy of their user interface; when you want to change something, you just grab the right knob and you know what's going to happen. Easy as pie.I don't know if you already have a Moog and a DSI Prophet '08 (Mopho), but I would think that with both a Moog ladder filter and the Curtis filter in the DSI synths you can make pretty much any 'vintage' analog sound.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=23897&sid=2459477edf67394aed0d517376ba59f8#p23897

Does your power cable have a fuse too (like the UK plugs)? If so, test it.Have you tried removing and reinserting the Nord fuse?Have you tested the new 125 mA fuse? Tried more than one fuse?One final thing before sending it for repair. I would open it again and make sure that the switch for the voltage does not have a ""blind spot"" where it looks like it is switched to one voltage but it is not making a contact (i.e. without being connected to the mains, switch the voltage selector forwards and backwards again to make sure the switch is in the correct position).If none of this brings it back to life, have a look in Nord's webpage, they list the distributors, you could give them a ring and see what they say.Hope it is solved soon and cheaply.

The Wave is also 18-note polyphonic, which means you can have 18 notes (voices) sounding at the same time. Since it is bi-timbral, you could have 5 notes sounding in slot A and 13 in slot B - dividing the 18 voices up over the two slots is done automatically and is not something you can influence directly.In the case of the MIDI settings (and this is likely what you're actually asking), I think setting it to bi-timbral causes the Wave to send on the MIDI channel of whatever slot you have currently selected. If you choose a channel, it will always send on that specific channel. I think you probably want to have it set to a fixed channel (I suggest 1, the default) and have the DAW decide where the MIDI messages need to go.

You can use the Keyboard position as a morph controller and use it to control the output of a slot.  So, you can have one sound that will get louder as you go up the keyboard, and one sound that will get louder as you play lower on the keyboard.  I have found that using this technique that the volume of either slot is almost non-existent at the soft end (higher or lower) so this works for a useful pseudo-split on the keyboard.Hope this helps.-dj",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=4335&sid=2459477edf67394aed0d517376ba59f8#p4335

It would probably be the best to do this via a DAW (Logic, Ableton, etc.) since that will make it easy to repeat (and the DAW can do latency compensation). This also makes slicing up the notes easy; for example, make all notes start at the beginning of a bar and draw the notes you want in the piano roll (which also makes it easy to modify length and velocity, etc. for a whole bunch of notes). There's also commercial software to do this automatically (Resampler and SampleRobot are two options).Load the samples into the sample editor to create an NSMP file and load that into your Wave. Now start tweaking envelopes, effects, etc. to get the sound you want.While you can have a completely different sample per key if you want, envelopes, effects settings, etc. are shared across the entire keyboard. This limits what you can do. Also, a sample is just a registration of a particular way of playing a particular note (velocity, how long was the key held own, was aftertouch or some other modifier used, etc).You should definately give this a try. You'll get a better understanding of what you can and can't do with the Wave.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=13163&sid=2459477edf67394aed0d517376ba59f8#p13163

Unlike newer instruments like the Stage 2, the Wave cannot do MIDI over its own USB connection.I'm a bit confused. I had a brief look at the manual for the M-Audio Ozonic I see in the picture you posted. It has MIDI in/out and audio in/out. Do you have the Wave connected to the Ozonic via both MIDI and audio cables? I'm asking this, because you mention 'USB MIDI' interface. In the picture you posted I don't see this 'USB MIDI' interface (I'm thinking of a USB cable with two MIDI cables connected to it, like the E-mu 1X1 below).Also, from your description it appears to me you have the MIDI leads connected the wrong way. For example, with the 1X1 above you'd connect the grey MIDI IN connector to the Wave'sMIDI OUTand the black MIDI OUT connector to the Wave'sMIDI IN. OUT connects to IN. Normally MIDI cables are completely black and you'd have to look at the description for the ports you plug them in to. Try swapping the MIDI cables in the back of your Wave. If the MIDI LED next to the display isn't flashing, the Wave isn't receiving MIDI. If it is flashing but you don't hear anything, it might be receiving MIDI on the wrong channel (try channel 1 first and check the MIDI Menu section in the manual - you have a global channel which acts like playing on the Wave's keyboard and you can also give each Slot its own MIDI channel for more flexible setups).When looking at that picture (again, I'm assuming this is a picture of your setup) I'd expect 'Ozonic External MIDI' to be the active input and 'Ozonic External MIDI' to be one of the active outputs. Whether you output a MIDI clock (shown as sync in the image) to the Wave doesn't really matter, since it doesn't use that clock anyway (the Stage 2 would use it, for example). This is assuming you want to use the Wave to play on and to produce sound. You can likely have multiple outputs as well as inputs active at the same time, though I can't really see how you'd select on which MIDI output you would want to send (in Ableton Live and Logic you can do that).",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=23305&sid=a45f5e218c89409627c217b62316bc4d#p23305

The second cable allows you to play on the Wave and send MIDI note data to the computer; for example, you might want to use the Wave to play a piano sound in something like Garage Band (if you have a Mac). Please note that MIDI cables only transfer information about pressing keys, turning knobs, etc. It doesnottransfer audio signals. Also note that MIDI OUT connects to MIDI IN - don't connect MIDI OUT to MIDI OUT and MIDI IN to MIDI IN. You won't break anything, but it just won't work.As for audio: you need an appropriate cable to connect from the Wave's two mono outputs (on 1/4 inch/6.35 mm jacks) to whatever input you have on your audio interface. If you connect it to a line-in input on a PC soundcard or on a Mac, you need a cable that goes from two mono outputs (on the side of the Wave) to a stereo 3.5 mm jack. If you have an external audio interface, you likely have 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) jack inputs so you would either use two mono patch cables or use a cable that has two mono (tip-sleeve or TS) 1/4 inch connectors on each end. Below is a photo of such a cable:Any decent music store should be able to hook you up with the right cable.

Specifically, I had issues with my Waldorf Blofeld, where the right output is a TS jack but where the left output can either output a mono or a stereo signal (based on whether you plug in a mono/TS or stereo/TRS jack). This caused the right output to be treated as an unbalanced connection (good) and the left one as a balanced one (bad). The solution was to use a mono cable for the left output.Using mono cables with unbalanced connections makes sure weird stuff (like the Blofeld's left output) also works as expected (= as unbalanced) with balanced audio interfaces. So I'd recommend using mono (TS) cables; if you've only got stereo cables lying around, I'd try those first since it will probably work fine. If you get a very weak signal, you might want to test with a mono cable just to make sure the audio interface isn't treating it as a balanced signal (in my case the volume on the Blofeld's left output was very weak, while the right one was normal).I thought I'd just quote myself, as I posted this in a different thread not 5 minutes ago.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=23396&sid=a45f5e218c89409627c217b62316bc4d#p23396

An example might be clearer. Suppose you turn the OUTPUT level to its minimum (0)beforesetting up the morph and then set up the morph to turn the volume up to 50% (= press Velocity morph and turn the OUTPUT level know to 50%). If you've done that, you can turn the OUTPUT level back up again while playing and the 50% you set up for the morph will get added to the new (low) value. For example, if you turn the OUTPUT level knob to 50% (afteryou've set up the morph as described above), the Wave would morph between 50 and 100% volume instead of the 0 to 50% you configured earlier. You can't go over 100% though, so if you turn the volume to 75%, it will morph between 75 and 100% where it will likely reach 100% with medium velocity (64). I'm not 100% sure about this last bit though, the Wave might 'scale' the morph over that 25% so you reach 100% at a velocity of 127 instead of 64 (just like when you had it set to 50%).I hope I'm not confusing you more. I can also set up some simple settings using the Sample Editor (if you create your own sampled instruments), but this just uses the morphing of the Wave. On the Electro 3 it is the only way to set this up though, since it doesn't have separate morphing controls.Using other morph sources (like wheel/ped and keyboard) and destinations (like filter cut-off) works the same way. I'm pretty sure you can also 'add' morphs from different sources. For example, have velocity control 50% of the volume and set up a morph using the modwheel to control the remaining 50% (I think you just set up both to morph from 0 to 50% and they get added).",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=23304&sid=a45f5e218c89409627c217b62316bc4d#p23304

Make sure you only have the slot your working on (probably slot A) enabled. See the section on slots on page 11 of the manual.jadams wrote:2 how can I display the name of my sound on the screen?The display shows program names. Create a program for your new sound.

So the answer to your question is pretty much 'no': Sound Manager is always one of the last steps; it can only create Nord Sample files for you based on the WAV files you feed it.Also note thatMIDI does not store sound.

You could also disable 'Local Control' on the Wave, which means the Wave will not respond to you playing on its keyboard. If you then hooked it up correctly to your workstation (let's assume a Roland Fantom), you could play a piano sound on the keyboard of the Fantom, an organ sound on the Fantombut played via the keyboard of the Wave, while the Fantom might be sending MIDI data to the Wave for nice pad sounds.But maybe I'm complicating things too much here and making things more confusing for you.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=22877&sid=a45f5e218c89409627c217b62316bc4d#p22877

Of course, that won't help if you created programs of your own that use samples.I had the same issue and created a utility that can show this, but it is rather user-unfriendly and you'll likely only be able to use it if you're fairly IT-savvy.

I don't think the Wave has that mesh, though my Stage 2 did. You can use an isolated screw driver to move the switch (a pen would work too, but an isolated screw driver is safer).You should change the fuse to a 250V 125 mA SLOWBLOW fuse. It will work fine with the current fuse (since it is already 250V and allows more than the required amount of power to pass), but in some situations the 125 (or 150, if you can't get that) might blow (and protect your Wave) while the 300 mA one wouldn't. Described in a different way: the 125 mA fuse would allow the synth to use about 30 watts of power for a few seconds before it blows, while the 300 mA one would allow it to use just under 70 watts continuously. The Nord power supply is probably somewhere between 20-25 watts, so if that would start using say 60 watts for several seconds there must be something wrong so ideally the fuse would blow and you would know this would happen so you can have a service technician check it out.Summarized: the heavier 300 mA will project you (the user) just fine, but provides a bit less protection for the Wave.If you do flip that switch, make sure to put some new sticker near the power connector that states it is now configured for use with 230 volt. Plugging a 230v unit into 115v likely won't damage it (it won't work though), but the other way around will probably damage the power supply (and possible a whole lot more).You could use an external step-down transformer to go from 230 to 115 volt, but those are cumbersome.Small tip (might be in the link above): just loosen the screw at the back-left and back-right, because the top panel rotates around those. On the pictures of the Lead 2X you'd see a plastic washer under those screws; my Lead 2X had that, my Wave didn't. But at least you can see in the pictures what screws I mean: the ones with the white, plastic washer underneat them.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=22580&sid=a45f5e218c89409627c217b62316bc4d#p22580

Nords which have been set up to run in a 220v environment are fused at 125mA.  Changing the setting on the internal power supply from 110v to 220v without changing the fuse is exposing the unit to potentially catastrophic damage.IF THE SWITCH IS TO BE FLIPPED, THE FUSE MUST BE CHANGED.Going from 220v to 110v, if the fuse is not changed it will likely blow fairly quickly, rendering the unit inoperable, but damaging ONLY the fuse.

I don't know the Oberheim sequencer you're referring to, but the MIDIpal might make an interesting combination. With the filtering that the MIDIpal can do, you can work around the lack of keyboard splits on the Wave, for example. I have a Mutable Instrument Shruthi (2 actually) and they're awesome. They share some functionality with the MIDIpal - I do hope creating sequences on the MIDIpal is more fun, because on the Shruthi it is fairly laborious. I certainly wouldn't want to tweak sequences in a 'live' situation.The Sequentix Cirklon is a realy nice hardware sequencer with a lot of features and good hands-on control, but it is not cheap:http://sequentix.com/cirklon.htm(you might want to skip to 0:34)[youtube][/youtube]As for the Wave and incoming MIDI clocks and external arpeggiators: the Wave cannot sync its clock/LFOs to an external clock (which the Stage 2 can do), so it just disregards any incoming MIDI clock. If you have an external arpeggiator send the Wave notes, it'll happily play those. If you want to play on the Wave's keyboard and have an external arpeggiator mangle the notes you play, set Local Control to off and send MIDI from the Wave through the arpeggiator back into the Wave (you could see the arpeggiator as a filter).An iPad with a MIDI interface can also nicely fit into a MIDI setup. I'm not exactly up-to-date with regard to the music apps available on the iPad, but I would think there are several decent sequencer apps and there's probably something that can do what you want. If you already have an iPad, that might be something to look into.Edit: you could also using something like Ableton Live to do this kind of stuff.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=22421&sid=a45f5e218c89409627c217b62316bc4d#p22421

There are several interesting (commercial) sequencers, weird and wonderful controllers (including an iPad version of the Jazz Mutant Lemur controller), a software version of the Yamaha Tenori-On, lots of mediocre but also some very good softsynths (I like Sunrizer, a Roland JP8000 emulation, and Animoog, Moog's softsynth and Waldorf is appearently coming with a new synth for the iPad).

I thought the Prophet '08 sounded a bit tame and once I tried the Evolver, I knew I had to get me one of those. I bought a new (ex-showroom but with full warrenty) Poly Evolver Rack (http://www.vintagesynth.com/dsi/pekr.php) which is the rackmount version. It turned out to be broken (and spare parts are no longer available), so after 5 months of complaining I got my money back (it still hadn't been repaired). Communication with Dave Smith Instr. was good, and I blame the store for this. I now have a Poly Evolver keyboard and it sounds awesome. It can sound analog like a Prophet, but also very grungy and digital.However, if I had to choose between a Poly Evolver and a Tempest right now, I think I might get the Tempest instead. It's like a 6-voice Prophet (with less knobs, but same voice architecture) but with an awesome drum machine interface (if you're into that kind of thing).Arturia's Spark is supposedly pretty good (needs a PC/Mac/Laptop though). A Walforf Blofeld module might be interesting too, since it can make a lot of sounds the Wave can't (though there is quite a bit of overlap) and it sits very nicely on the right side of the Wave, so it doesn't take up any room. Both the DSI instruments and the Blofeld are fairly complex, allowing you to create all kinds of weird/complex modulations, potentially using the built-in sequencer (fairly basic 16-step one).I also like U-he's Diva synthesizer (VST/AU) plugin - when I heard that I immediately sold my Roland MKS-50 (rackmount version of the Alpha Juno). I don't really have the patience/tollerance for 'vintage' hardware (the battery was soldered on and needed to be replaced, one voice sounded different than the rest, the delay was starting to get worse and caused quite a bit of noise) and Diva was able to sound just like it.Mike Leghorn used Diva for his versions of Holst's The Planets.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=15855&sid=a45f5e218c89409627c217b62316bc4d#p15855

I just havnt decided which way to go yet... but its a nice 'problem' to haveI appreciate your insight - I actually approached this purchase with the identical mentality... I was primarily looking for a analog poly synth to compliment my Nord Stage 2, and then realised that the 6 analog voices + the complex sequencer does just that. I suppose we differ in that while the Stage 2's synth section, which is modelled from the wave, is a significant improvement on the older Stage (I sold my Stage EX for a Stage 2), its still not a 'full synth'. I guess thats why I'm putting so much emphasis into understanding the Tempests capabilities and limitations as a poly synth.Regarding the 08 v the Tempest: To me, they seem very similar (minus the 2 voices but plus the feedback, distortion, compressor and sub-oscollator)... Can you bypass the 2 digital oscillators? Do you know if they intend to implement the aftertouch/arpeggiator? Have you had any experience with other DSI synths, specifically the 08? Since you bought your Tempest ""primarily for a synth"", how does it perform? What are you happy/disappointed with?To be honest, I was originally in the market for a prophet 08 (after seeing james blake in concert). But, when my local music store offered me a Stage EX at a very cheap price (because they were clearing stock for the Stage 2), I decided to buy it so that i could have access to the wonderful piano/rhodes sounds, to help improve my piano skills, and for a solid master keyboard. I then sold my Stage at a profit and bought the Stage 2 (Im very very happy with my decision, but it took a full year for me to fully appreciate my choice... I feel like you really need to live with the gear to understand it... and a 'leap of faith' is always required when buying new gear). A years worth of savings later, and here we are... to be honest I'm leaning towards the Tempest, I'm just looking to make a very informed investment.Thanks for your input, truly appreciatedLooking forward to hearing back from you",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=17326&sid=a45f5e218c89409627c217b62316bc4d#p17326

However, as far as I know it is identical to the newer Tetra (which is a small, 4-voice module) except that it does not have the sub-oscillators and the feedback circuit.TetraTempestEvolverNotice how similar the Tetra and the Tempest are. The Tempest seems to lose the sub-oscillator for oscillator 2, but gains a high-pass filter and the two digital oscillators, which are used for playing small samples (since it is primarily a drum machine, of course). Also notice how much more complex the Evolver is when compared to both the Prophet '08 (Mopho/Tetra) and the Tempest.jamoo wrote:Can you bypass the 2 digital oscillators?Yes, you can simply set the volume for those to 0.jamoo wrote:Do you know if they intend to implement the aftertouch/arpeggiator?It might be a good idea to shoot DSI an email about this; they're generally very responsive to email.

Have a very little resonance on the filter: just a slight touch of wave's character. Then balance the sound with EQ (may be add a little more bass for phatness and a little highs to highlight the glassy sound of the lead tone). Finally, a little of stage reverb will polish the sound. DOn't forget to save it and thus reserve slot B for a contrasting sound so you can switch between lead and rhythm instrument like rhodes, for example. Btw, this track is very proggy. I like, nice!For the second sound the story is similar. Start with square waves and simply add distortion and reverb and see what it sounds like. You might want to play staccato when you play arpeggios and hold fifths when you sustain that weird distortion harmonics overlap effect like in the solo. You can also try sampling some type of external sound that has a similar physics to square wave and then work with amp envelope to achieve a lead character.Hope this helps!Rock on!Manoffono!!!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=21619&sid=a45f5e218c89409627c217b62316bc4d#p21619

A program is a complete sound, including oscillator, lfo, filter and effects settings. As you can see in the image you posted, you have a section for Programs and a section for Samples in the Sound Manager.Unlike a program, a sample is not a complete sound. It is a building block for making a sound, in that it is one of the possible oscillator types in the Wave; some of the others ones are virtual-analog waves (pulse, sawtooth and triangle), FM, wavetables and sampled waves. Wavetables have a fixed length and generally consist of a single cycle of a sound; sampled waves are similar, but they include an attack portion. Both wavetables and sampled waves are built-in oscillator sources and cannot be modified.Clavia generally uses the term Sample to refer to a collection of samples, usually of the same sound source but recorded at different pitches. Generally 2-3 samples per octave is enough for a good sounding  Sample, where the Wave generates the 'in-betweens' when you play keys for which a sample is not available. You can create your own Samples using the Sample Editor, which lets you load and combine WAV files and lets you export a Sample (nsmp) file. Unfortunately there is no way to directly convert a Nord Sample file (nsmp) back to the WAV files that were used to create it.To get started with a Nord Sample (and this is the part that probably interests you most) use the 'SAMP init' function. Press and hold the Shift button and then press the Vibrato button (it has SAMP init written below it, which means that this is the function the button has if you combine it with the shift button). Using the SAMP init function changes the current sound to have some default values to start with a new sample-based sound (there is also the SOUND init function to create a starting-point virtual-analog sound). For oscillator 2 the SAMP oscillator type should already be selected (select it if it isn't); use the dial below the LED display in the OSC2 section to select the sample you wish to use (you will also see the full name in the main LCD display).This should hopefully get you started with samples. Using the SAMP init function creates a very simple sample-based sound; using all the functionality of the Wave you can 'sculpt' it into much more interesting sounds that really come alive if you play them (use the morph functionality for this).Using samples on the Wave has a downside: you can only have one sample per key (one velocity layer). For example, a typical workstation (like a Roland Fantom or Yamaha Motif) will usually have 4-7 velocity layers per key. By changing the speed with which you hit a key (the velocity), you 'select' which sample is played. In this way workstations like that implement dynamics, which are of vital importance for making an authentic sounding (and playing) piano, for example. For lead sounds (which the Wave excels at) this is generally not required though. Using the filter and the morph functionality, you can create dynamic sounds on the Wave, you just can't recreate a convincing piano (for example).",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=21987&sid=a45f5e218c89409627c217b62316bc4d#p21987

Since you got the Wave synthesizer, I assume creating (or tweaking) your own sounds is one of the things you're interested inCreating a simple sound based on a sample is not that hard: you need to press the SAMP INIT 'button' and select the sample you want to you. This is described on page 18 of the manual. You'll find SAMP INIT written below the vibrato button: if a text is written below a button, it means you need to press shift and that button to use it. So press the shift button (and keep it pressed) and then press the Vibrato button. This creates a default starting point for sounds based on samples; now select the sample you want to use (check Sample Instruments on page 21 for more info on how to do that).Unless you safe changes you've made, they are lost when you switch to another program.If you go to the information page about the Wave on the Nord site, there is a section called Program Library. You can find quite a few libraries of complete sounds there. All these sounds use the default samples or the virtual-analog section, so you won't have to upload additional samples. These are also excellent for getting ideas on how to create your own sounds. A tip to help you here: if you press shift and turn a knob, it will show you the current value, instead of changing the value.Btw. I've moved your post to the section for the Wave, you're more likely to get helpful answers there",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=20996&sid=a45f5e218c89409627c217b62316bc4d#p20996

If you miss the sound of the Stage, I think the Wave might let you down somewhat as it has its own sound; an Electro is more like a dressed-down Stage. If sounds like the Nord Lead can produce interest you, the Wave might be a good choice since it can do almost anything the Leads can and adds a whole new sonic palette in the form of samples.

This is the most logical way, as this is also how you use the Wave yourself when you play on the built-in keyboard. Unless you've changed settings in the MIDI menu, the Wave defaults to this mode and is set up to receive MIDI on channel 1. You change this setting in the 'MIDI Channel' section of the MIDI menu.The other way, where you can send MIDI messages to each slot separately and treat the Wave as two seperate synthesizers (in a way), is enabled by setting the 'MIDI Channel' option mentioned above to 'BI-TIMB' (bi-timbral). After you've done this, you can set the channel for slot A (MIDI Ctrl A Channel) and for slot B (MIDI Ctrl B Channel) - these two default to channel 1 and 2 respectively.If you've played around with the MIDI menu before (or if you just want to make sure the settings are correct), you might want to verify both the 'MIDI Control Change Mode' and 'MIDI Program Change Mode' settings have at least receive (RCV) enabled.As stated above, I assume you've set up Logic correctly.

This is a bit like turning on both slots on the front panel, though for MIDI these switches have no effect; you configure the MIDI channels instead.

This leaves channel 1 for the global channel.Ableton will have no idea it is sending MIDI data to two parts of the same synth and this is okay, but there are some gotchas. One has to do with program changes: when you start playing a MIDI clip, if configured Ableton sends a program change MIDI message to the synth and by default the Wave is set up to respond to that (can be disabled). If you see the program on the Wave changing when you don't expect it to, this is probably what is happening.I'm not completely sure about this, but I think you need to send the program change MIDI message to the global channel, which means that if you want to use two different 'instruments', they need to be in the same program (since you can copy slots between programs, that is easy to fix). This would also mean sending a program change message to either slot A/B has no effect. Since I don't have a Wave anymore, I can't test this myself.Ableton cannot normally have audio and MIDI in the same track. The simplest way to set up your Wave with Ableton would be to create three tracks, one audio and two MIDI. The audio track would take its audio from the audio interface the Wave is connected to, the first MIDI track would be configured to send to slot A and the second MIDI track would send to slot B. If either slot A or slot B plays notes, the sound will enter Ableton via the audio track. This is a bit weird: you send via the MIDI track and receive via the audio track.There is a better and more logical way to use external MIDI instruments: create a MIDI track and add the 'External Instrument' device from the Instruments section (you can only add this to a MIDI track). If you look carefully, the 'MIDI To' field below the clips will change to 'Audio To' - this device gives you a way to use an external MIDI instrument in a way that is very similar to a softsynth. If you go to the settings of this device, you can change 'MIDI To' (this is where it went) and 'Audio From' (select the right channels on your audio interface, just like when using an audio channel). You also get an additional 'Hardware Latency' field; this allows you to compensate for latency introduced by the MIDI interface and the device itself. More on latency below.In this case using the 'External Instrument' device might not be the best choice, because the Wave always mixes the output of slots A and B on a single (stereo output). If you were to use the 'External Instrument' device and would set the 'Audio From' field to the same setting on both, it would appear as if both slot A and B are producing sound when only slot B is played; it implies both slots have their own dedicated audio outputs, which is not the case on the wave (but you can do it like that on a Stage or Lead). I think that with the Wave it makes more sense to do it the 'traditional' way, so create an audio track (call it Wave-Output) and two MIDI tracks (Wave-A and Wave-B). I think this more closely resembles what is going on at the hardware level (= both slots are mixed on the single stereo output). You could group the tracks I suppose and for browny points you could include the global channel in its own MIDI track, purely for changing programs - it would have empty MIDI clips, but with a program change configured.As for latency: Ableton automatically compensates for latency of the audio interface. The driver of your audio interface reports the latency to Ableton and if it does this accurately enough, Ableton will compensate for it. If your driver gives Ableton incorrect values, you can correct this by changing the 'Driver Error Compensation' value in the Audio section of the Ableton settings. Ableton however has no idea how much latency your MIDI interface (and sometimes the device itself) adds; softsynths have latency too, but Ableton does correct for this (probably because they report it to Ableton). If this additional latency is low (say less than 5 ms) you might not notice it, but I think that differs from person to person; a drummer might hear this sooner than a keyboard player (just guessing here). You can add additional latency (I think you can use negative numbers too). Latency can be added either as a specified number of samples or a specified time (fractions if a millisecond) - this goes for both audio interface and hardware (MIDI) latency.Latency added by an audio interface (but also external equipment such as a hardware reverb unit) is fairly constant, but I've noticed it can be all over the place for MIDI interfaces connected via USB. My Roland (Cakewalk) UM-3G MIDI interface is very accurate, but my old M-Audio interface wasn't very accurate and the MIDI-via-USB functionality of my Stage 2 was even worse; if you want really tight and solid MIDI timing, use a good MIDI interface and send it via the MIDI in port of you Nord, not via the USB interface.Let me know if this answers your questions/helps you. Please also let me know if you have no idea what I'm babbling on about. It might be interesting to turn this into something of a general howto for connecting Nord instruments to Ableton live.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=19383&sid=a45f5e218c89409627c217b62316bc4d#p19383

It does not have an organ emulation nor does it do pianos. However, I do think you would be able to recreate something 'simple' like the harpsichords (instruments that don't require more than one sample per note). You could sample an organ and it would sound fine, but it is static, you can't change the drawbars, etc.The way to get an organ with different drawbar settings on the Wave would be to upload more sampled instruments (either made by you or from some other source, like the Nord Sample Library). The software can't help you here, that's only for creating 'samples' or 'sampled instruments.'A Stage makes a much better MIDI controller than a Wave (or a Lead 2X for that matter), but it still has less features than a dedicated controller keyboard. I've had a Lead 2X, Wave and Stage 2 and as far as synthesis goes, the Wave is the most powerful of the three. The biggest difference between the synth section on the Stage 2 and the Wave is the fact that it only has one oscillator (though it does have a sub-oscillator you can detune when using saw wave, etc.) and much less modulation options (i.e. the LFO on the NS2 is rather lacking in what it can be used for).It is probably best to think of the Wave not as a sampler (rompler), but a synth that can very flexibly use a (set of) samples as a sound source (oscillator); this is in additional to the traditional virtual-analog stuff the Lead 2X can do (though you only have 2 instead of 4 parts, as you say). To create dynamic behavior (i.e. have it respond to velocity, etc.) you would use morphing and/or modifying filter settings. You can't do velocity switching which you would need for some complex sounds, such as pianos. Note that the Nord Sample Library gives you a starting point (the samples) for a new instrument; both on the Wave and the Stage 2 you still need to do the work to turn it into something that sounds nice; the term synthesis very much applies here.It is not impossible to replace both your Electro and Lead 2X with a Wave, but I think it is fairly likely the results might not be what you hoped for (i.e. no dynamic behavior on organs, etc). Using a Stage 2 to replace both the Electro and the Lead 2X sounds more probable, but then you'd loose something in the virtual-analog department. If you already have a Slim Phatty, that might not actually be an issue because the NS2 can definitely do the 'bread and butter' VA sounds, though you might need to revert to the use of samples in some cases.Anyway, just some thoughts.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=19262&sid=a45f5e218c89409627c217b62316bc4d#p19262

On the Wave, it looks as though when I adjust the ""Shape"" knob, that's effectively increasing the volume of the modulator. However, is there also a way to change the pitch so it changes which overtones are boosted?Just to clarify, I know that by using Osc Mod > FM, I can achieve this by adjusting the pitch of oscillator 2. However, just using the FM algorithms selectable on the LED, are there any ways to adjust the pitch of the modulator in, say, one of the 2-operator algorithms to that I can produce inharmonic frequencies in the overtones?Also, can anyone recommend a good resource--book, site, video, etc--sharing some FM tricks (EG how to create FM strings, FM brass, etc).Thanks!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=17691&sid=a45f5e218c89409627c217b62316bc4d#p17691

For me FM is a bit like voodoo. I just toyed around on my Stage 2 but the sounds I got sounded a bit like a combination of a whale song and a small dog being sat on by its fat owner. Horrible enough for my cat to decide to leave the room rather than having to endure it.I think the shape knob changes how much the modulator influences the carrier (and how much feedback there is)for that particular oscillator; unless you use Osc Mod, the shape knob for OSC2 will never have any influence on OSC1 and the shape knob for OSC1 will never have any influence on OSC2. This is what I get from the diagram on the bottom-left of page 22.Directly above this diagram it says:TheShapeparameter is used for setting the amount of modulation and/or feedback from none to maximum.I think this is the same as what you describe (increasing the volume of the modulator).If you use FM on an oscillator, you will actually have a carrier, a carrier + modulator or a carrier + 2 modulatorsrunning on a single oscillator. So you could actually have two FM sounds in a single slot (one on each oscillator) or four by using both slots. If you set OSC1 to a sine wave (either using 1-OP FM or by using the shapable sine options from MISC) and use Osc Mod, I think you're actually running 2 operator FM (OSC2 does not need to be a FM sound itself, but it could be). However, from this diagram it appears you influence just the carrier, not the modulator. So if you set OSC1 to 2-OP FM, you'd probably have two modulators modifying the same carrier instead of OSC2 modifying the modulator of the carrier on OSC1.The diagram in the section on Osc Mod (page 24) just shows OSC2 modulating OSC1; it doesn't show or suggest what it modulates (the carrier or the modulator(s)).Btw. have you looked at the Mod envelope? Could that be of any use?",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=17740&sid=a45f5e218c89409627c217b62316bc4d#p17740

Hilarious. I guess it's true that the Dutch speak English better than Americans!I've become decent at producing tortured FM whalesongs as well.The best I can figure out so far is that, going through the FM algorithms, you tend to create higher overtones when increasing the ratio of carrier to modulator. But I'm still on the hunt for any tips on how and why to apply any of the particular ratios, when to use feedback, etc.You're right that the shape knob only effects the particular oscillator, unless you're using Osc Mod, in which case the shape, semi tone control, and fine tune control of osc 2 all effect the tone of osc 1.Per your question, I believe that, when you're using Osc Mod, Osc 2 influences the ""carrier"" of Osc 1, since the ""carrier"" refers to what you actually hear, and you can set up Osc Mod regardless of whether you have an FM algorithm selected as your wave type for Osc 1 (and using FM terminology, all of the wave types have ""carriers"", but only the FM algorithms would also have ""modulators""). I believe there is no way to effect the modulator volume or frequency of the modulators within the FM algorithms... although since I'm not very familiar with FM synthesis, I don't know if this is a relevant limitation.I did try out the modulation envelope to help control FM, and it does help add expression. BUT, one limitation of the Wave is that the envelope can only be routed directly to Shape 2 (and not Shape 1). You CAN use LFO 2 in Single Cycle mode to do something similar, but you have less control over Attack/Decay than with the envelope where you can set those values independently of each other.Something nice I discovered (and many probably already have) is that, when using Osc Mod > FM, and then detuning the Fine Tune of Osc 2, it creates a pulse (probably a natural phase effect), almost like an LFO is modulating the sound.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=17783&sid=a45f5e218c89409627c217b62316bc4d#p17783

The Nord synths (and probably most other virtual analogs that do FM) are more restricted and a modulator can only modulate the carrier (and via feedback itself, which can be turned on/off).My DSI Poly Evolver also does FM on the digital oscillators and while it has even less features than the Wave when it comes to FM, you can create some pretty cool sounds when using feedback. I toyed around with that a bit yesterday, as it can do more FM tricks than my the Stage 2.Edit: it seems there is a trial (demo) version of Native Instruments' FM8 synthesizer.

Free-running oscillators, LFOs (unless it's a global one) and envelopes are generally unavailable since they're more difficult to implement on a DSP (digital synth), while on an analog synth it is hard not to implement a free-running one.From your description above I get the impression you expect the filter to be open when you play the second staccato note (because of the long release). However, it will not be open; the envelope will restart from the beginning and will start opening again. This is assuming you've set up the program you are playing to be monophonic (possibly legato).Even though the Wave has two slots (it is bi-tembral), it has 18 voices which are dynamically allocated where needed. Every voice is separated from the other ones and has their own oscillator, LFOs and envelopes - it is essentially just a bit of computing power on the DSPs in the Wave. If you retrigger a sound (that is set to be mono instead of polyphonic), it might not even start on the same 'voice' like it would on a real analog synth. Since that new sound has its own oscillator (because its on a new 'voice' and/or the oscillator is restarted) the phase of the sound may change. Even if the attack of the amplifier envelope is set to 0 and the filter is all the way open there might be a little dip in volume - I haven't looked at if this is the case on the Wave.saverio wrote:This soundsvery strangeto me because I played other synthesizers (like Korg MS20, Moog Minimoog and also digital ones like Minimax ASB etc...) and this is the first time I hear this kind of behaviour in a filter envelope...Well, the 'analog' synths I've played with had digital oscillators (DCO's), LFOs and envelopes and and analog (low-pass) filter (and amplifier).

Envelopes get retriggered (start from the beginning, the attack part, again) when a voice starts a new sound (which might actually be the same note). This is especially noticible if you set the Wave in mono mode. The same goes for LFOs.If, however, you set the Wave in legato mode, envelopes do not get retriggered. The downside is that the voice does not immediately sound at the note corresponding to the key pressed, but instead slides (glides) to the new value. The speed with which this happens can be set with the Glide knob. Note that on the Wave you can only use legato in monophonic mode (it is a specific mono mode). See page 16 of the manual for more info, the 'Mono Mode button' section. On something like the Moog Little Phatty this works the same way.Unlike the other Nord synths (except maybe the Nord Modulars), the Nord Lead 3 (three) can actually be set to a polyphonic legato mode, in which envelopes don't get retriggered. I haven't looked at the details though. On my DSI Poly Evolver you can turn retriggering of envelopes off; if you don't they work the same as on the Wave.I'm sure I can babble about some more somewhat related things and start on DCOs and VCOs, but that probably won't make things clearer.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=16633&sid=a45f5e218c89409627c217b62316bc4d#p16633

If there's already some sound on the Wave that is somewhat similar to what you want to achieve, you might want to copy that program to a new location and have it use your own sample. You can then tweak the program which might already have usable envelopes, etc.But to be honest, starting from scratch might be a better idea. It is very enlightening to take an existing program and to play around with the settings. How is it constructed, what determines the sound, etc. I would suggest turning off any active morphing, because that simplifies matters. Playing around with the rate (speed) and amount of LFOs, the filter cut-off and decay/release on the amplitude/filter envelopes is probably a good place to start.I you have some sound you like in slot A, you could copy it to slot B and tweak it there. It is then really easy to compare the sounds or to play them at the same time.

Most use samples, but not all, and the ones who do use the standard samples.I think a lot of not most of the examples are recorded on the Wave, since it has the most extensive means of modifying a sample-based sounds (though the Nord Stage 2 has more effects).

If it is discontinued, which would not surprise me, would it really make a difference? Clavia keeps updating the sample library, the OS is stable and while we might want to see some new features, Clavia is unlikely to implement those in the existing Wave regardless of whether it is a current product or not.I'm not holding out for a Wave 2, as in my opinion the Stage 2 coverts that area fairly well. Instead, I think it would be great to see a new synth (something to use alongside the Stage or Electro) based on the Nord Modular line of products. Something like a souped up Modular G2, with the ability to use samples and wavetables as an oscillator source (like the Wave); ideally it would also have some inputs so all that DSP power could be used with some great effects on both the inputs and internally generated sounds for even more possibilities. I think Clavia already has all the technology to create something like that. If they were to combine it with a more up-to-date interface to use in the studio (since I doubt you'd be tweaking it a lot in the field) and 37 or 49 keys, that'd be a sweet deal. I think a touchscreen might give them a lot of flexibility to tweak the interface on that thing and might even allow them to keep costs down, but I don't think a touchscreen would be ideal for live use, you'd at least want some decent knobs and buttons. A fairly large monochrome graphic display (320x240) with some soft buttons to the sides and bottom could make a nice alternative that would work better in the field.Anyway... I doubt Clavia would sell a significant number (just like the Wave, probably), certainly not like the numbers of Stage and Electro boards they sell. It wouldn't surprise me if Clavia left the synth spot in their product line open for a while. While it is a bit sad the Nord Lead 2X survived both the Nord Lead 3 and the Wave, it still sounds excellent. As a VA it is much more capable than a Stage 2, so it makes a nice match with the Stage 2 for certain types of sounds (of course, you could just use samples on the Stage 2).Hurray for speculation.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=13735&sid=5289dff4943618ced82808709d4aa44b#p13735

I bought a Virus TI Polar two years ago, but grew tired of it after a few months and swapped it for a Nord Wave. A few months after that, I missed my Virus and got a 2nd hand Virus TI keyboard, which got sold again to help finance my new Stage 2.The Total Integration (TI) stuff always worked fine for me (used to be really buggy) and you can create some very amazing sounds with it (especially really nice pads), but for some reason the sound doesn't really convince. Every time I hear my Poly Evolver I can hear why I still have it. The oscillators on the Virus sound a bit thin to me though; with layers of effects applied (which almost all presets have) they sound fine, but 'bare' oscillators fail to convince. For example, I think the oscillators on the Nord Lead 2X sound better. On the other hand, the build quality of the Access synths is excellent (as with most German engineering, except Behringer) and you can definately do very cool things with it.I'm sure I'll get another Virus at some point though. I'm missing my 2nd already.Maybe I'll get a module next time.The Virus is excellent for electronic type sounds, especially if you want to do sound design. It is a rather complex synth with lots of menus to navigate, but if you use the TI software from a DAW it suddenly becomes very simple to use.I wouldn't mind Clavia making a synth with a nice set of effects, lots of different oscillator types, etc. like the Virus.Edit: lots of typos",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=13747&sid=5289dff4943618ced82808709d4aa44b#p13747

The Poly evolver is on my alternatives list....I thought the virus had a minimum of menus...oh well..It has lots of knobs and buttons but because you can do so much with it, several knobs and buttons have more than one function. For example, if you push the Reverb button, a menu will open with the settings for the reverb. By turning the knobs below the display (or by using the buttons to the right of it) you can change the type and several associated parameters. Some menus will have more than one page and you will need to press buttons to go to the page you want.So while there are lots of 'menu screens', you can generally just open the one you want by pressing the associated button. The display will show you what you are doing and things such as the current value of whatever you're changing. A page has three values you can change with the knobs immediately below them. So in a menu with just one page you press a button and then turn a knob to change the setting.With the wave you have some thing similar for some parameters; for example, you press a button to set osc2 to a sampled wave and then turn the rotory dial next to the screen to select the one you want.There are also three user-assignable 'soft knobs' (the ones below the display); you can assign a function and name to them. It makes sense to assign a parameter to them that does something useful to the current sound but that does not have a dedicated knob. Something like a 'bit crusher' type effect is a good example.For standard stuff like changing filter cutoff you have dedicated knobs. However, for oscillators, LFOs and modulation sources you first press a button to select the right one (3 oscillators, 4 LFOs and 6 modulation sources) after which you can change rates and stuff. If you want to change more in-depth parameters (uni- v.s. bi-polar LFOs for example) you may need to press the 'edit' button in that section to open up the associated menu.So yes, there are lots of menus, but it is easy to get to the right one and during performance it is unlikely you will need to use them. For studio work the Total Integration software is more convenient as it groups related parameters on one screen, where they are easy to change with the mouse (mostly sliders and knobs) and where they often have some sort of visualization to show you what you are changing.As far as I know the only thing you cannot change on the Virus TI itself is user defined arp patterns. You can select arp patterns and associated parameters. Instead, you draw (width and height of bars) your custom arp patterns in the TI software and then store them so you can select them on the Virus.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=13800&sid=5289dff4943618ced82808709d4aa44b#p13800

It looks like the functionality of the Wave is set in stone, especially if it will be discontinued (as someone posted). I think the Wave was, in part, a platform to test out new technology (as was the Nord Lead 3). Technology of both ended up in the Stage of their time (NL3 -> Stage, Wave -> Stage 2). Now the synth section of the Stage 2 can do a lot of what the Wave can (certainly not everything though) the Wave might be a bit obsolete.Also, if you look at which sub-forums are the busiest here you'll find it is the Stage forum, followed by the Electro forum. I think that should, at least to a degree, reflect which products they sell the most. I wouldn't be surprised if Nord were to focus more on the Stage, Electro and organ lines of products. And there's that drum synth of course, but that's likely done by a different development team. If someone's just going for features, sampling and huge libraries I think a Korg Kronos, Yamaha Motif XF or even a PC with soft-synths might be a more obvious choice. That's all well and good for in the studio, but isn't live musicians typically a crowd that will buy Nord instruments?

In order to get the entire signal out of the Wave, do I have to use both left and right outputs?Hi DJKeys,While I don't own the Nord Wave, I found one in a local music shop over the weekend and decided to investigate.You are correct that the Nord Wave doesn't have a summing jack and therefor requires both Left and Right audio outputs to be connected.I took a peek in there with a flashlight, usually an instrument that sums on one jack, has a normally closed contact in the opposite sides' jack.This contact would parallel the two audio signals together like a Y-cable. I didn't see this in the Nord Wave.My recommendation would be to use a Y-cable to sum the two outputs whenever you want to run in mono.Themanualmakes reference to it being a true stereo signal path. As I interpret this, even if you were to start with a monaural sample, you'd still encounter issues with the stereo effects section ""if not using a Y-cable to do the summing"".Feel free to contact Nord technical support for confirmation at this link:http://www.nordkeyboards.com/main.asp?t ... al_supportI hope this helps.Cheers, Hanon",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=3064&sid=5289dff4943618ced82808709d4aa44b#p3064

Arbitrarily ""mixing"" via this means can cause all sorts of weird phase cancellation effects and usually sounds like @#*@#%, depending on the nature of the timbre(s) being played.Stereo signal is provided for studio situations and for those rare live situations where the house sound system is stereo.  For most common live situations where only a mono send is needed, just take one side or the other -- it doesn't really matter which.  This is not a situation which can be compared to ordering a steak at a restaurant and cutting it two pieces when it arrives to the table only to throw half in the garbage.  With the exception of programs with extreme tremolo/panning effects in use, you won't really be losing any meaningful portions of the audio signal, and you'll be sparing your ears from having to listen to a phase-cancelled mess.Anyone wanting a longer, more drawn-out discussion of this can reply to this post and I'll supplement, but that's the heart of the matter.

You mic each in stereo.  Both mics will pick up both ends of both instruments, but there will be phase differences due to distance traveled from string/tom to mic.  In order to create an authentic stereo playback it is necessary to hear both sides.  But you still aren't really losing anything, other than perspective, by giving up either one of the two sides.In my view, it is natural to have this sort of gut feeling that by not taking both sides of the signal, one is somehow missing out on something, but properly analyzed that is not actually the case.  It's more like covering up one ear...you still hear everything.  The difference is you are hearing it from only one perspective, instead of from the two perspectives which stereo would provide.  The point is, generally speaking, you are not actually missing any content, not when we are talking about ordinary real world examples.However, sometimes the electronic instrument world takes real world examples to the extreme, as in the case of a Fender Rhodes on hard panning tremolo.  In that kind of a case, the oscillating volumes of the two sides of the stereo field, 180 degrees out of phase with one another, will result in completely changing the character of the resulting sound when you remove either side.  Those kinds of things do not occur with acoustic instruments -- the halves of the stereo field are not so extremely segregated from one another.Understanding how and why these things can occur, and that they occur only rarely in particular circumstances, will help one to avoid those situations in one of three ways: don't use those kinds of effects settings when being forced to run a single mono feed, or run both sides of the signal, or live with it.  Sometimes ""mistakes"" make for new creativity!  Also, in many of these cases (I think), the issue is not so much that the house system is mono (which it usually is), but that the mixing board is cramped for space and the engineer doesn't want to give the keyboards two channels for one instrument.There will be very few situations in which taking only one side of the stereo feed will yield unsatisfactory results...Bless,Pablo",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=11493&sid=5289dff4943618ced82808709d4aa44b#p11493

If an instrument (NWP) configures oscillator 2 to use a sample as its source (SAMP setting), the complete instrument would consist of both a NWP and a NSMP file.The files you can download from the Nord site are (collections of) samples of existing instruments, they are not recreations of these instruments even though the Wave might be able to recreate them in some cases (such as some Nord Lead sounds). To use these sounds, you first need to add them to the sample library (Samp Lib) on your Nord Wave. You do this with the Nord Sound Manager (the other program, Nord Sample Editor, is for creating your own NSMP files).Start the Manager and click on 'Samp Lib' below the row of buttons at the top; Samp Lib stores your samples (NSMP files) and Program your programs (NWP). To add a sound, click on 'Sound Down' in the button bar at the top and find your sound. It is now added to the Samp Lib. Note the location (a number) of the sample. Normally the manager software will just pick the first free slot, but if you click on the Organize button on the left of the button bad, you can select the exact slot you want to place the sound in. You can also move and rename sounds in the manager.Now you've loaded the sample in the Wave, create a new sound to start with. Keep the 'shift' (the grey button just above the wooden pitch stick) button pressed and then press on the mono mode button (to the left of the volume know at the top-left). This initializes a new sound (sound init). Now do the same for samp init (shift + vibrato button, just to the left of the mono mode button) - this sets up some default settings for playing samples. The LED display for oscillator 2 should now show a number, this is the currently selected sample number. Set it to the sample you uploaded earlier and give it a try. If the number is blinking, it is pointing to a location that currently does not contain a sample.This gets you a starting point. You can now use the rest of the functionality of the Wave to sculpt the sound to your liking. In my opinion, using the Wave just to play samples as-is is better done using other keyboards.Of course, this information is also in the user manual, but I'm feeling in a generous mood",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=10872&sid=5289dff4943618ced82808709d4aa44b#p10872

In Cubase I have setup a Midichannel with the output to the Wave on channel 1.Midi Setup on the NordWave (Operating System is 2.02):Local: ""Off""Midi-channel: ""1""Midi Ctr A: ""1""Midi Ctr B: ""1""MIDI Ctrl Change Mode: Send&ReceiveNow when I play a patch (with both slots activated) everything is ok, I can hear the Sound correctly and I can record. But when I want to tweak some controls like Freq, the display does NOT show the parameters, like it is in ""local-on-Mode""!Furthermore i can only tweak parameters of Slot A, Slot B is frozen - no possibility to edit it. I don't think that this should be normal behaviour. This problem also remains with Slot A and B in Bi-timbral mode on different channels.After trying out all possible combinations of Midi-Setup and reading the manual all over again, I found out that according to the manual (page 60), there should be an option in the MidiMenu to set MIDI Ctrl A and MIDI Ctrl B to ""OFF"". But this option does NOT show up in my Nordwave.

Currently, the only one in production that I know of ishttp://www.midisolutions.com/prodevp.htm# though you could probably also do it with various computer programs if you have your Wave hooked up that way.One of the limitations of the Wave is also that you can't send the Slot A sound out the left output and Slot A out the right (or vice versa). So if you want a split where the two sounds are output separately, you're probably back to just the sample method... where you can not just put different samples above or below a certain note, but you should also be able to put one sample just on the left channel and the other just on the right.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=1763&sid=5289dff4943618ced82808709d4aa44b#p1763

The other one should be a small footprint versatile board mainly for Synth and if possibly sample playback. While a Moog Voyager would be great, it is currently out of my price range and is a bit too heavy. So when I played the other day around with a Nord Wave, I was impressed how flexible it was! While the keybed certainly is not its strongest point, I liked the sounds and easy tweakability. On youtube, I then found a bunch of crappy videos but also three really excellent ones, so enjoy:[youtube][/youtube][youtube][/youtube][youtube][/youtube]",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=985&sid=5289dff4943618ced82808709d4aa44b#p985
