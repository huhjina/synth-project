That led to a somewhat different type of process for me where I recorded simple melodies one-handed (… yeah - who am I kidding; all my melodies are simple).Even though this track doesn’t have any Nord sounds on it, the NS3 always plays a big part for me. I play the keys for a lot of the synth parts on it and record the MIDI and then print the audio from other hardware or plugins. The NS3 has a wonderful keyboard and has inspiring sounds that help with the process.This video attempts to show some of the parts and pieces that went into the track. I have additional explanations in the description within YouTube.The mastering was done by Shawn Hatfield",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=184557&sid=1295a4e656b2244f1ec7559aaf665aec#p184557

I'm new to nord, but not to piano & music. I have a long history, but...here goes:I started music in 2nd grade ('72), w/ the (Bb) clarinet in elementary school. I learned how to read basic. I also, was brought up, by my mother singing in the church choir, & in 2nd grade, when I joined band, I also joined the school chorus. I learned pretty well, when in 3rd grade, the chorale teacher recommended me for high school honor chorale. So, I would get bused over to the local HS water school & did a little touring w/ the HS Honor Chorale.3rd grade was transformative for me, as I started my rebellious streak, I didn't get along w/ my 3rd grade teacher, who was also the chorale teacher. So, I wasn't getting along & I didn't like the songs, so I quit. I also quit band & while still going to school, checked out, because I was bored.So, I pretty much dropped all of that & in HS (10th grade - around '83), I decided I wanted to be a guitar player. Taught myself, & all my friends thought I was the greatest, but...  we all know better, eh?  I was a semi-decent hack.A couple years after HS, I decided to straighten out y life & ended up in a huge circle of musicians. In this circle (SoCal - LA area) The demographic was something like guitarists 90+%, vocals 2-3%, drummers 1-2%, keyboards 1-2% & there was 2 bass players. I saw myself as maybe avg, or maybe a little less, in the pool of guitar players, & a friend of mine's band needed a bass player. So, I started learning how to play bass. The band leader was a guitarist, that was a drum major in school, so he learned drum theory, subdivisions, etc. he coached me to play bass, to play along w/ the drums, not to just be a bass note guitarist, staying on the root.So, I played bass, for 15 years on a professional level. In that, I was introduced to a small amount of keyboards. I had a little Casio, as a kid, & taught myself the notes, so, I already had that knowledge, & could play easy chordings to back a small part here & there (the band had a Roland D50). Towards the end of that period, I bought myself a Roland XP10, but, after the band split up, I never really played it. In 30 years, I've probably played that thing less than 50 hours...A couple years ago, I decided I wanted to finally get serious about learning, so I started looking for an electric piano, w/ weighted keys. I picked up an old Roland that, I guess was semi-weighted, & not very inspiring. It did get me back into it though, but, not really enough to keep me going (lasted about 6 months)...Last year, I decided, hell or high-water, I wanted to get serious about it. So, I started scouring the internet looking to see what keyboards are considered ""best"" in the upper class of keyboards. Obviously, being into musical instruments & other audio/video gear, there really is no best, but there's top of the line & a few different brands w/ different philosophies. It was up to me to find the best for me, based on what I wanted, my philosophy, & who had what I wanted, & then look around for best bang-for-buck...After months of educating myself, looking at weighted keys, best hammer action, sounds, etc., I saw a pawn shop selling a piano5 for $2200. I went & checked it out, & offered $2000 & he took it. It didn't have the nord 3 pedal, but had a 3rd party single. I ended up buying the nord 3 pedal.So, now I have the piano5. I'm still a hack, albeit, a semi-educated hack, as far as the world of music goes, & especially piano playing.I play guitar, bass, piano, violin, cello, harmonica, & sing a little. I should have been a great singer, but, not keeping up with/ it, you lose it, & I have a problem w/ laryngal collapse, that gives me sleep apnea, & has affected my voice, where I don't get the range I once had, plus... getting older. So, I do play a lot of things & can pick them up easily, but, I'm not great, at any of them. For the most part, I can hold my own & be a team player.My playing style in music has always been aggressive when needed, & soft & subtle, also, when needed. I am tending to gravitate towards classical sounds on piano, but, I am a (heavy) metal head at heart. I have always like rhythmic playing, & harmony.I have been playing on the nord, since last early Dec. I was playing it through my Yamaha studio monitors, through a Neve interface. I decided to buy some dedicated speakers, & bought a set of QSC K12.2 w/ KS112 sub's. Kind of nuts, having this (8,000 watts) for my living room, but... the sound is awesome. I am using a mix of 2 grand pianos (white & silver) & 2 string sounds (symphonic strings legato & mellotron 3 violins) a little delay & cathedral reverb...Hopefully, I'll be doing a program, where I'll be playing some piano/keyboard, before too long & also playing some guitar/possible singing. This is why I joined. I have some questions, &... they seem like the most elementary to getting going on performance, but I haven't found the answers yet browsing through the forum yet, so, I'll probably be asking a few things.Anyway, glad to be here & look forward to being a part of the community, if there's any way I can help, I'll be glad to, but, as of now, I'm the n00b...Cheers!P A U L",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=184231&sid=1295a4e656b2244f1ec7559aaf665aec#p184231

Things are slightly complicated as I haven't played keys in every band I've been in - in others I've been the guitarist or bass player; though when I've played another instrument I'm surprised how often the keys player is using a Nord! I believe the following is correct:1988 - Yamaha PSS-680 (first keyboard)1990 - Roland D5 (first gigging keyboard, also first use of multi-track demoing using an Atari ST sequencer - threw out around 2007)1994 - Hammond L100 (never gigged, just sat in the lounge while I worked out how to play it)1997 - Hammond M100 split + Sharma Leslie cabinet (retaining the Roland D5 for piano sounds)1998 - Wurlitzer EP200A (replacing Roland D5), Crumar Organizer (spare organ when I didn't have enough friends to help cart the Hammond to gigs)2002 - Nord Electro (the Hammond and Wurlitzer were immediately retired and after some years of deliberation I sold them in 2005)2006 - Alesis Nanosynth (bought cheaply on eBay after getting asked ""whaddya mean you can't play a string sound"" on the Electro too many times)2007 - M Audio ProKeys 88 (to play piano and organ at the same time).... which brings me onto my current rig:2011 - Nord Stage 22012 - Fatar Studiologic SL 990 (replacing the ProKeys which I sold in 2018)",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=124452&sid=1295a4e656b2244f1ec7559aaf665aec#p124452

Shame on me because I’ve trolled so much useful info and advice over the years. So to start, a late but sincere apology and blanket thank-you to the much more thoughtful players and posters on this forum.This thread got me thinking of all the great and goofy gear I’ve used since 1967.My first organ was my mother’s Thomas home spinet POS. When my older brother Tom switched from organ to electric bass at 13 years old, he also stopped being a pain in the ass. Instead of antagonizing me, he taught me “96 Tears” and “Midnight Hour” on the organ so I could join his first band, “The State of Mind”. Tom and I have gotten along great ever since: all thanks to music. After being taught those two very basic (but more than 3 chords each) tunes, I figured out the rest of our set list by ear, at 12 years-old. To this day I regret not learning to read music. I can follow any chord chart just fine, but the “ants on the page” elude me still. Am I not a “real” musician? Depends on the gig I suppose.I borrowed a Farfisa Compact for early rehearsals. But its owner was in a rival band; and our first gig was a church-sponsored Battle of the Bands. I needed one of my own. Mom got sold a Rheem Mark VII, my first portable organ. We lost that battle but learned an important lesson: a lot of girls come to see bands play…I played the Rheem for maybe two years before trading up to a used Farfisa Compact. My first amp was a Gibson Kalamazoo Bass 30. At first I set it up in front of me, and wondered why I couldn’t hear myself over the drums, etc.! I can’t imagine what we sounded like out front, no monitors, vocal mics plugged into the amps along with the instruments. Mom was proud when we landed gigs in actual nightclubs, so she and other mothers initially dropped us off and picked us up at gigs all that summer of ‘68. Dad, having heard a few rehearsals, could not believe we were getting paid to play. But he never again had to shell out an allowance, so he let us proceed. We often made $25 a night each, eventually playing five nights a week, four 40 minute sets with 15 minute breaks. That’s a lot of music. In terms of cost of living adjustments, the pay for regional musicians hasn’t gone up much. Now the standard rate is between $100 and $200 per night each. But unlike back then, now you have to be able to play! There weren’t nearly as many musicians playing rock & roll in the late 60s as there would be ten years later. We soon had plenty of money to buy instruments on the installment plan, and whole ounces of Mexican marijuana for cash. Those late 60s smoke-filled, low ceilinged night clubs somehow felt like heaven, albeit with red velvet walls. We often became  well protected young pals of club-owner mobsters. Dangerous men, they could be very warm and funny as long as you didn’t mess around with their mistresses and wives. A couple of previous horn-dog old pals still walk with a limp…Upon first hearing “Green Onions” on a transistor radio, I didn’t know what that organ was, I only knew I wanted one. What I wanted, of course, was a Hammond B3 and Leslie.Mom came through again, talked Dad into loaning me the deposit for a Hammond Mini-B and, just as important, a Leslie 122. My second brand-new instrument was a Hohner Clavinet D6, more on account of NRBQ’s Terry Adams’ guitar-like virtuosity than for the more popular  funk stuff. I miss the real Clavinet still, but will never again carry anything heavier than a Nord Stage Compact.Gigging steadily through high school in the stinky red rooms where they let any long-haired goofball drink for free, I added a Rhodes 88 Suitcase. Being a moron, I thought bigger must be better! I don’t miss that particular Rhodes at all. I played the Rhodes and Clavinet through two Acoustic guitar amps with 4 10’s each. Clean? Yes. Loud? Oof!I sold those amps and the Rhodes, bought a Fender Twin Reverb for the Clavinet: much better.I finally ditched the Mini-B and bought my first Hammond B3 from a huge musical instrument consignment store. I didn’t even try any of them. I chose mine from among nine or ten other B3s because it was closest to the store’s front door! $900 with no dollies. That beautiful old B3 was stock ebony black, I’m guessing mid-60s. And it turned out to be a fantastic sounding Hammond, the best one I’ve ever played. I bought dollies, and eventually had its wobbly road-worn front legs firmly bolted on. I would occasionally stand on top of that B3 and play brief cluster-****y solos with my right foot. Then I stopped drinking...Eventual samplers aside, I was not, still am not, too big on synths (Stevie W. early Todd R. and a few others excepted). Cover bands were expected to bleat out some of those sounds back in the day. Instead of the popular Mini-Moog, I got sold a Steiner Parker thing. Its oscillators went out of tune in cold weather; and I live in New England…Eventually I pared down my set-up to just the Hammond B3 and Clavinet. Soon after they became available I added a “portable” Yamaha (CP80?) grand piano. Except for its action, I do not miss it either.I regret selling that old black B3 though. It’s the only instrument I’ve ever been sentimental about. Its new owner painted big white spots on it so it looked like a big, sad oblong cow. Damn! But I’d moved to New York City, and needed money and portability. I used a Roland JX-3P for a few months, but soon upgraded to a Yamaha DX-7 played through a small Roland Jazz Chorus 10”. Was never satisfied with my sound back then. And just imagine trying to get to gigs in NYC carrying the seemingly lead-lined DX7 in taxis. It was pure hell. More often though, gigs back then were on the road with either a back-line Hammond or, in the case of a year spent touring with Jr. Walker & The All Stars, his chopped B3. Chopped indeed: into four separate boxes, with wires everywhere. But it fit in the bus’s undercarriage luggage compartment. That organ’s finish was a smoke-yellowed silver sparkle vinyl: very cool. And Junior had neon lights installed beneath its manuals, Great was red, Swell was green. My face must’ve looked like a freaky Christmas Tree when the house lights went down. But I was cute back then, and women did not seem to mind.I got sick on the road, with severe stomach problems. Based in Southern New England again, a sickly road hog, I played a Korg CX-3 for a couple of years. If you’ve read this far, here’s where it gets more interesting. In Atlanta with Roomful of Blues, my previously undiagnosed Crohns disease caused peritonitis, necessitating emergency surgery. It was touch and go. I was very lucky to survive (RIP Eagles’ Glenn Frye, who did not survive Crohns surgery). They’d had to blast me with antibiotics which turned out to be otto-toxic: I eventually lost most of my hearing in both ears for ten long quiet years. No more gigs? Heck, no more “normal” conversations. I used useless hearing aids, and painted funky furniture for my sister’s antique shop to make the rent. At home I played a Wurlitzer 200 EP turned-up too loud. And I was, except for family, a great girlfriend and many old pals, a sad shadow of my former self, a ghost at holiday dinner tables.The happy ending: in 2002 I had Cochlear Implant surgery. Many CI users back then couldn’t appreciate music at all, but I was determined to try. After two years of frustration and practice, relearning hard to discern distorted harmonies, taking aural baby steps, I was able to start playing with understanding and patient musician pals. I used a Yamaha Motif 73, with a stinky-sounding Roland Drawbar fake Hammond MIDI thing. I won’t even bother to look up its name. Ugh.Being so successful at regaining music with the cochlear implant, I’ve traveled all over the world lecturing and demonstrating what it’s like at symposiums and universities.About ten years ago, I finally FINALLY got around to buying a mint used Nord Electro 3 73, two QSC K10s and an Allen-Heath Zed 6 mixer. It was fantastic to once again access decent Hammond, Clavinet, Wurly, and passable pianos in a lightweight package. Now my heaviest piece of gear is my overstuffed Taylor cord & gear bag, and a drummer’s large hardware canvas tote for a table stand and custom bench (added a folding backrest). My aching back thanks God and Nord. I upgraded to an Electro 5 73 maybe five years ago, and now keep it as my home-based spare. Just before the pandemic I bought a mint used Nord Stage 3. (otherwise I tend to buy older versions of Nords after new ones come out). I’ve griped about the Stage 3 Hammond and Clavs not being as versatile or authentic-sounding as even the earlier Electros. BUT, I’ve grown to love my Nord Stage 3. I’ll post some pics of the customization of its knobs sometime. I switched-out many of the black ones for different colored metal knobs, red for overdrive, blue for effects, chicken heads for master volume etc. It’s easier in some of the heavenly, dark shithole dives I play, to instantly differentiate among knobs’ hues visually. And I enjoy having a one-of-a-kind keyboard among so many same old red beasts out there. As I did with my first Electro 3. I used a white oil-based paint pen to change the number 3 on the Stage into an 8. I don’t run into too many Nord-savvy keyboard players at gigs, but when I do the looks on their faces are pretty funny. “Wait, a Nord Stage 8? WTF?”Well, although I nearly never post, I’ve now blurted out a goddam novella. Sorry. Thanks if you’ve found it at all entertaining. Protect your hearing, pals and strangers. Wear earplugs: insert them half an hour before you play so your brain can adjust. Avoid high doses of intravenous Gentamicin if possible (though they’ve got the dosing down now). Tell that damn guitarist to turn down! And whatever you do, keep on making music from the heart with whatever gear you like best. It can’t save you from the inevitable heartaches of the music business and life, but it lessens the pain (for as long as the song lasts, anyway). Most of you pros know that by now.Wishing you all good luck and great success.

But a 70s harpsichord as well.During studies, no keys at hand, so I played recorder, guitar etc.In 2008, I decided to get back to the piano - but only for accompanying singers, mostly popular style. As I came from the piano, a single AP sound seemed to be enough:> Yamaha CP33 (2008)Interestingly, quite soon EP sounds got more important to me than AP ones. Even if I only had 3 and a half different sounds in that tool.For playing around with sounds at home, a MIDI controller seemed to be the next thing I needed. Unfortunately, I wasn't very well advised and got something a little different:> NI Kontrol S61 mk2 (2019)which isn't very useful for MIDI controlling - only for controlling NI Komplete. An absolutely annoying world of presets as I learned quite quickly.Next was something to take with me that could be played stand-alone and meet the basic needs:> Yamaha reface CP (2019)which is really nice inside a travelling bag but not so nice to be played when performing. Great EP sounds, though. No need for the hidden bonus AP sound. A small Roland MobileCube was enough for the moment to amplify.Then I got keyboardist in a big band. Needed organ sounds and some synths. Plus a lot more capacity to tweak (EP) sounds:> Nord Stage  3 Compact (2020)Great thing, a little costly, but worth the invest. Unfortunately, the purchase resulted in a second investment:> 2x QSC K8.2 as monitors. Yamaha Stagepas 400 were ridiculously useless for that.All this should have left me a happy owner of everything you need. Apart from a small disappointment with the CP33 as a weighted external controller for the Nord:> a used Kawai VPC1 needed to join the club (2022)Great weighted action. Unfortunately too bulky to haul around.As the reface CP wasn't that good to take to school or elsewhere, I got another mobile solution:> Casio CT-S1 (2023)Great to just hack a rhythm into the keys.And I sold the acoustic piano. And wanted to learn more about creating EP sounds. And a few more desires:> Viscount Legend '70s (2024)which sometimes sounds better than my NS3 sounds. Unfortunately some other times, it has a little hiss that I can't get rid of - depending on the power provided. Happens only on stage. At home, it's a nice weighted practicing board as well.So, within a dozen years, quite a collection came together. Of course, none of those keyboards already had to go. At the moment, the Viscount and the Nord are in a battle around the better sounds for the big band. And bring me to always do another step forwards. The rest sits around waiting for its opportunity.Which in the end is a collection of different mimicking sound generators - nothing original for the moment, nothing original to be planned. Sounds like I'm living in a digital world.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=183094&sid=1295a4e656b2244f1ec7559aaf665aec#p183094

I've had this in my head informally for years, and it's taken me many months to get it realized.Medley of two American standards: It's Only A Paper Moon (composed by Harold Arlen, Yip Harburg and Billy Rose) and Tuxedo Junction (Erskine Hawkins, Bill Johnson and Julian Dash).The goal behind this recording was to challenge myself to create near-authentic wind and acoustic instrument parts. I tried to emulate how these instruments might be played by real musicians to achieve something a bit more than just a mechanical sound. Particularly for the horns, all dynamics and articulations were manually created. I'd give myself a C+ on it.The entire guitar part was recorded manually. I was looking for Freddie Green style strumming, but could not find MIDI patterns that I liked. Instead, I voiced and played the rhythm and solo freehand. This helped achieve the slight inaccuracies in timing for a more realistic sound.Same mindset was used for the bass. I wanted to achieve some of the nuances and realism an actual bass player would bring to a recording session.Bass: Orange Tree Samples Core Bass PearDrums: Kontakt Abby Road 60’s Drummer with various patterns added from Band-In-A-BoxClarinet: VG Jazz ClarinetTrumpet: Kontakt Session Horns TrumpetGuitar: Kontakt Picked Nylon, manual playing (no auto rhythm)Piano: Nord Piano Library Pearl Upright: Yes indeed, this had the perfect personality for the recording.

Specially the trumpet. How do you have played the trumpet on the keyboard?Thanks. To answer your question - it’s mostly cheating in a way.The first thing is to try to learn how a musician plays that particular instrument. To use the trumpet as an example, Jazz trumpet players will use bends, vibrato and slides in a certain style. You want to try to learn those stylings and figure out how to emulate them. There are also attack elements, legatos, fall offs, etc. that need to be copied.The VST instruments allow you to map an instrument’s behaviors to the controllers and key switches. If you are not familiar, key switches are keys on the keyboard outside of the instrument’s normal playing range where you can assign articulation triggers. For example you can assign a “slide up” articulation to key C-1. When you hold C-1 down while playing the actual musical note elsewhere on the keyboard, the software will invoke that articulations for that note. Continuous controllers such as the mod wheel can control aspects such as dynamics and expression.The actual recording of the instrument is done in multiple passes. On the first pass, I play only the notes into the DAW in real-time, which captures the MIDI note information. On the second pass, I correct the notes that do not sound like trumpet (of which there are usually a lot) by going through them one by one.The next several passes involve looking at each note or phrase and adding the controller data and key switches to add the expressions and articulations. I repeat this last step until I arrive upon a rendition that I think sounds decent. The track is then blended in with the rest of the instruments and corrected until it sounds like it works.Apologies that this is such a long answer, but I hope it helps answer your question.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=181798&sid=1295a4e656b2244f1ec7559aaf665aec#p181798

I think it sounds pretty close to the original..  This time I set up a patch for Fly on the Stage 2, one panel has the synth through the on-board delay, one panel is organ, so I can do the synth then switch over.. with the longer keybed I just need to do the last two runs an octave up from the last, instead of oscillator trickery..  At the last run up I crank the feedback all the way so that it repeats forever - i just need to remember to switch back to that panel and pull the feedback back down at some point before switching patches to avoid an abrupt ending..

The layout of the LP is so amazing - the knobs are immediate and easy to tweak.  I don't know how familiar you are with the design, but each section gets a knob, LFO, VCO, VCF and VCA in that order.  Each parameter has a button associated with it, so in the VCA section for example there are ADSR buttons for overall VCA and for filter VCA, 8 total.  If you want to adjust one of those parameters, hit the button and the value appears around the pot.  They're actually pots, not continuous encoders, so it does some fancy things when you grab the knob.  You can have it snap to the pot position, you can have the pot need to rotate through the old value and it'll pick it up as you pass, or you can do what I like, and that's scale the travel of the value linearly w/r/t the distance left on the pot, so if the pot is at 12 o'clock and your value is at 3 o-clock, it will scale the clockwise change down by 1/2-ish so that the whole travel from 12 to 5:30 or whatever will move the value from 3 to 5:30 linearly.  This can be weird when your knob is at 8 and the value is at 4 and you turn it clockwise, but you get used to it, and it's easy to just grab the knob and make a change by altering your knob feel rather than wasting time trying to 'catch' the value or the jarring snap of the normal pot function..  AND, in the mod section you'll notice familiar nord-style 4 and 6 function rectangular buttons.  This thing is like a cross between a Nord and a Moog, and it's got a great sound..  Exactly what you need when you have a synth mind and you're running it live and you know what you want and what knobs to grab to do it.  The Voyager is great if you want to route mod sources and destinations all over creation and come up with fantastic sounds for exactly what you want, the LP is great if you want a lead synth that screams and can be tweaked on the fly very intuitively..One cool thing they did with the LP is to include an overload function - on the Voyager I route the headphone out to the audio-in and enable the audio-in in the mixer section and that way you can overdrive the filters and get great distorted tones, but it requires a patch cable, two knobs and a lot of balancing. On the LP they have an Overload button in the VCF section, just hit that, crank the knob, good to go..  Another awesome feature is an output on/off button, which allows you to make adjustments without having it leave the synth, so for example, I've got some songs where I gliss from the lowest to the highest octave with the highest portamento setting, and when I want to reset it to the low value I hit the off button, hit the low note, then turn it back on, and it's ready..  Also, it's got an auto-tune function which is fantastically clever, basically including a crystal that produces a tone of known frequency and occasionally, when you haven't been playing for a little while, it'll turn off the audio, compare that tone to the oscillators, adjust the tuning, then re-enable the audio..  clever!  Anyhow, I just got it and am loving it.  Haven't done any recording with the NS2 synth yet, but I use it live a bunch, it's definitely capable, but I'd characterize the sound as soft, whereas the Moogs are warm, but edgy..",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=19908&sid=1295a4e656b2244f1ec7559aaf665aec#p19908

I actually have problems coming up with patches that do not use samples and that sound smooth, like a generic smooth saw pad. I have played some VAs from the lower end and I find them soft compared to the NS.Yet I agree that when I play my Mopho or try out a Moog, those are definitely warmer, with more edge.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=19913&sid=1295a4e656b2244f1ec7559aaf665aec#p19913

The earliest I can find are from the early-mid '00s, when I was using NE2 and NE3...leading up to NS2 starting around 2011...there was a NE5 in there somewhere in the mid '10s...then NS2 EX...then NS3.My very first Nord was the NL1, which I used from around 1999-2002 in a wedding band, along with Roland RD-600 and Korg CX-3. I can't locate any pictures of this rig. I also used several different NL units over the years. I had the original NS1 and NS1 EX as well, though I don't seem to have any of those pics either.I had fun going on a trip down memory lane. I hope you enjoy the pictures!Early picture from ~2003 with NE2 above Yamaha S90. This was a KILLER rig and I still own all parts of it!Another from a similar era, when I had shifted from NE2 to NE3, probably around 2006ish. I didn't keep the NE3 for the long haul, though I loved it as the first Nord I owned that could load samples.There was a brief time when I was using NS2 plus NE3. This was around 2011-2012.The NS2 was my trusty partner from 2011-2018 (I still have my first NS2 88 pictured here).The NE5 snuck into the rig for a brief period, when I was testing the waters of ""can I do the gig with an Electro instead of the Stage?"" and the answer ended up being no.Used a couple of NS2 EX units around about 2016-2017, when I was getting close to the big transition from NS2 to NS3.NS3 became my mainstay around 2018 to present. I can get so much out of this keyboard on multiple different gigs.I'll leave you with an action shot from a recent gig with the NS3.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=173873&sid=1295a4e656b2244f1ec7559aaf665aec#p173873

The final result ended up being a Rhodes/Minimoog “jam”. It might be interesting to some here because I used the new Stockholm EP sample for the bulk of the piano part. I like that sample quite a lot. My original plan was to swap it out with something from Spectrasonics Keyscape, but I was not able to find one that “worked”. The original recording direct from the Nord seemed to work the best. Yet it still felt a bit incomplete. I ended up duplicating the Rhodes piano part through my old Yamaha DX7 using the well-known preset 11. To my untrained ears, that combination produced what I was aiming for. And then, for no good reason, I made a video attempting to show some of the work flow. I suppose that the main conclusion one might draw from this is that I should keep my day job and not try to rely on writing, playing, or videoing music.

I ended up solving it this time by playing a super loud drum track track with a snare on the down beat (and then a light snare on beats 2, 3, 4). My wife was ""videoing"" me with my iPhone. I started the daw playing the drum track with the loud snare. I clapped my hands once on the beat 1 with the loud snare and then started playing the next measure. That gave me the transients I needed to line things up. In the video creation (I used iMovie), I placed both the final audio track with the real recording and the one with the loud snare ""metronome"" with the transients. And in the final rendering, I just dropped the volume out of the snare version. But it gave me the info for lining up the hand claps at the start of the video clips. It was tedious, though. It turns out that iPhones (apparently) do not have pro quality timing. I had to delete a tiny fraction of a measure from the video near the end of the main clip to bring it back into sync.

The output on my Nord Stage 3 is stereo; it sounds great through my headphones and studio monitors. But I normally run it through my mixer and that had a single QSC CP12 taking both channels. While it sounded just fine, I added a matching speaker and the difference is noticeable. The mixer is a Yamaha MG10XU 10-channel with a nice bank of FX. I run a Boss RC 10R for drums; it sounds good through the QSCs. I'm too lazy to set up a drum track in Logic Pro or EZ Drummer, both of which are on my workstation. It's easy to click around the Boss and find a groove I want to play with. I don't keep any of my pedals on the floor as I don't want to bend over to adjust them.Nord Keyboard.jpg (206.92 KiB) Viewed 7254 timesMy kids got me a snazzy new microphone, a Shure Super 55, last Christmas. It looks really cool but is basically an SM58 in a fancy housing. You can see it just to the left of the music stand.Clean Tone Studio 1.jpg (245.5 KiB) Viewed 7254 timesJust about everything else is unchanged. The workstation is an iMac 24. The computer has enough processing power to handle my songs. I'm still a noob with recording, mixing, mastering, etc. I used Garage Band long enough to feel comfortable going with Logic Pro. I have EZ Drummer on the workstation and still am climbing the Logic Pro learning curve. The Focusrite Scarlett 8i6 audio interface meets my needs. I have never tried recording more than two instruments at a time and don’t anticipate that changing any time soon.The microphones are the venerable Shure SM58 and SM57. The 57 is for recording my guitars through the Marshall DSL40CR. I've not been able to duplicate the growl of my Marshall running the guitar clean into the DAW and then adding effects later. I can get highly satisfactory results with reverb, chorus, and all the other 'clean' effects. But the dirty growl is best captured through the microphone. My other microphone is a Shure Super 55. That thing makes me look like a star but it is basically an SM58 in a fancy chrome housing.The table is a Husky workbench that is height adjustable. I leave it at the highest (standing) position. The drawers hold extra cables, batteries, picks, tools, and other doo dads. The white board enables me to capture my ideas.

Books like Dave Limina's and Brian Charette's follow more or less this approach (by the way, there is very little teaching material around about the Hammond in general).Nothing wrong with teaching those things, but it seems to me that this ignores the ""elephant in the room"" question so to speak, that is the music itself. The ever-present (and valid) advice of ""just learn from the masters"", while always true for any instrument and genre, might not work so well when one is at the beginning of his journey, which is where I'm assuming the OP is at at this moment.So here's when I'll get anal.The organ (be it pipe or electric) is an instrument with unique features:1. The ADSR envelope (to borrow from the synth world) consists of a sudden attack, an infinitely flat D-S, and zero release.2. No key dynamics/velocity affects anything in terms of volume.3. Expression/volume is controlled (on electric organs, less so in pipe organs) with a pedal that affects every note, whether that's already being played or not.Apart from synthesizers, which can be programmed to behave any way you want, I'm not aware of any other ""natural""/acoustic instrument which possesses the above features all at once.But this is not just an academic arguing for its own sake. These features demand and even impose a very different playing approach and evenmindsetfrom any other keyboard instrument's. All of the above is going to have a big effect on things like chord voicings above all (how many notes, which ones, how wide/close...), or even whether and when to use chords at all, and it's going to make all keyboard approaches, that in order to sound good rely heavily on the sustain pedal and/or on key dynamics, pretty much unworkable on the organ. Anyone who's ever tried to play a digital piano without any sustain and with dynamics disabled will certainly have noticed immediately how much music doesn't all of a sudden sound good at all.Figuring out what to play and how to play it is, in my opinion, much more ""the point"" than learning when to switch the Leslie on fast and things like this. It's about finding one's own voice with an instrument that, despite looking like a keyboard instrument like many others, has to be reasoned through totally differently.I'm mainly talking about jazz here, which is the OP's concern. In organ jazz, there seems to exist this unspoken rule that says that in order to play organ jazz, you'll have to 1) play left hand bass with an 848 registration, 2) play solo lines with the 888 registration and percussion on, with a lot of cliche lines, 3) occasionally squabble as opposed to soloing, 4) have a guitarist in the trio to fill in the harmony (with a clean tone), and alternate solos with, 5) be as groovy, bluesy and funky as you can. This is the Jimmy Smith school which has become ""the norm"", when in fact it is justonepossible way to go about it. Yet, almost every organ jazz players that have followed fall more or less into this style, and the (very scarce) teaching materials that are around justassumeand take for granted that this istheway to play Hammond jazz. It's as if I wanted to play jazz piano and was taught the stride technique because, well, that'stheway to play piano.I believe all of this is very unfortunate, especially considering how beautiful and expressive the Hammond sound can be. It can be funky for sure, but it can also be very profound and moving. I'm still waiting for someone to put a Bill Evans-kind-of emotionality in Hammond music. Maybe Rhoda Scott has in certain occasions, and (occasionally) Lonnie Smith. But I can't name many others. In another life, in which I'm much younger and talented, that's what I would be striving to achieve, artistically. Anyway it's a huge void in organ jazz music, and jazz music, and music in general, that I'd like to see filled eventually.Gospel players, on the other hand, are a lot more variegated and sophisticated with what they do, and, lo and behold, they don't always use that damned 888-with-percussion registration, and they play proper pedals too. I think there's a lot to learn from them!Not sure all of this is still within the OP's scope of interest by the way, but I hope it wasn't too far away either.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=158687&sid=1295a4e656b2244f1ec7559aaf665aec#p158687

The pitch itself is part of the final timbre, but in the Hammond the drawbars don't act the same way as stops do in the sense that the timbre itself is the same,onlythe pitch changes. So yes when switching from pipe to the Hammond there's still some homework to do in order to learn the drawbars, but my point was that this is very little compared to all the rest that there is to explore!FZiegler wrote:it can be done without a guitar at side - see B. Dennerlein, analogika et al.Yes it can definitely be done, and Rhoda Scott is another great player that has played for a quite extensive amount of her career solo (well, with a drummer). I prefer her over Dennerlein, stylistically. Anyway, organ solo can be done but provided that you are good enough with pedals. That's something Scott and Dennerlein have in common. Most jazz organists play LH bass instead.I think the case of analogika's band is yet different, because it's true they don't have a guitar and have a bass instead, but their genre is something on its own and quite different from the ""jazz"" that I assume the OP was intending it to mean, and from what usually the ""jazz organ trio"" phrase refers to. (For instance, Lachy Doley also plays in a trio with a bassist and no guitar, but again he isn't jazz in this sense, he's pretty much rock/blues.) Just to exemplify, this is what most people mean when they think jazz organ:Then how not to name the most famous jazz organist until a few months ago, Joey DeFrancesco: as great as he was, he was essentially a more exuberant, technically impressive, and groovy Jimmy Smith. It is the exact same lineage and feeling (and sound, and band philosophy). There's always this laid-back, let's-have-fun, let's-be-funky attitude behind much much much ""organ jazz music"" that comes out from this mindset. That's not a negative thing per se, it's just that I, and I'm sure many other people, would also like to see a bit more meditative and ""committed"" kind of organ jazz.An example of what this could be, more or less:Still not 180° away from the JS lineage, but an interesting take of what can be done.FZiegler wrote:It would be interesting if you and others might throw in another two or three words about your feeling/thinking while playing the organ.Indeed!I suck too much to make a meaningful musical contribution to this, but... who knows, maybe one day, before I die, I'll be able to churn something out that's worth hearing...",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=158690&sid=1295a4e656b2244f1ec7559aaf665aec#p158690

If you mean something else, please tell us.Paolo86 wrote:So the main question is, what is the basis of Hammond playing.Well that is precisely what my long post tried addressing: the topic is too big (as it would for any instrument), but just to sketch out what the current landscape looks like:1. If you are looking for published instructional material (books, courses,...) on the Hammond, you won't find much, regardless of the genre of music, and the material you will find is generally concerned with things that are somewhat marginal to the music itself (what the chorus/vibrato is, when to switch the Leslie, etc.). This is not to say there aren't resources at all, or that they don't sometime go beyond that. The already mentioned Dave Limina and Brian Charette's books are examples, and also Tony Monaco's videos. Also, you must have already checked it out, but there are a bunch of YouTube videos, some by professional players, that give hints. Not structured courses, but useful tips here and there that you'll have to work onto. Sometimes there's some good stuff on YT.2. If you are looking for in-person classes, you'll have to resort to a local teacher, as ""jazz organ"" is not academically taught anywhere in the world as far as I am aware. Depending on where you are located, you might or might not find someone. Also, finding a Hammond player around you doesn't automatically make him a teacher. There are a lot of players that are full of s*. I would rather learn on my own.3. Since you said you want to play jazz, the current take on jazz Hammond playing is what I summarised in my previous post, that traces back to the Jimmy Smith lineage: 90% of it consists of a trio with a guitar; the organ is in charge of the bass; 888-like registration; groovy/funky/bluesy vibe to it etc. etc..But, as Tasten-Bert says, do tell us which kind of music you're interested in and we can better guide you toward any learning path that might exist.As a final note, one reason why teaching and learning organ, especially jazz organ, is difficult is because it's an instrument that's intrinsically and historically in charge of many different things that ""normal"" instruments would address separatedly. A bass player only plays bass. A saxophone player only plays monophonic solo lines. A Hammond player is supposed to play bassandchordsandsolo line,andmodulate the timbre of the sound, and, and, and, all in real time. So yes ""some"" things are intrinsic to the organ, other things are just ""general"" jazz music knowledge and practice that transcend the instrument. For the latter category, there are plenty of resources anywhere. It just takes a lifetime to master them!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=158712&sid=1295a4e656b2244f1ec7559aaf665aec#p158712

Well, you know me, I have accumulated 2 binerds of 3"" depth about all the subjects above.So, in january, my wife, in kind of a little crisis about me having all the house for me, told me, you use your ""S..."" or you sell it. Ok, so, I said why not trying to start again the band and I had a lot of great answer,  more and with greater level than before!! SO, I'm back at the keys and as i was asking myself yesterday why I don't have any songs of Britney Spears in my setlist, normal, most of her hits are Pré 2010....I sill checked to see if ""Toxic"" was here and no, so, maybe i will learn finally how to sue the Nord Sample software.But I have 1000 posts to go through, I,m not going to read all of them but at least, I will post on some few ones and all that top say is that, if you learn another instrument, you really open up a lot your musicianship.That's it for today, happy to be back anyway.IMG_5364.jpg (6.24 MiB) Viewed 8986 timesIMG_3924.JPEG (526.87 KiB) Viewed 8986 timesIMG_5530.jpeg (2.43 MiB) Viewed 8986 timesIMG_5519.jpeg (2.5 MiB) Viewed 8986 timesIMG_5517.jpeg (2.95 MiB) Viewed 8986 timesIMG_5322.jpeg (2.75 MiB) Viewed 8986 timesIMG_5321.jpeg (2.83 MiB) Viewed 8986 timesIMG_5320.jpeg (3.14 MiB) Viewed 8986 timesIMG_5319.jpeg (3.38 MiB) Viewed 8986 timesIMG_5312.jpeg (2.42 MiB) Viewed 8986 timesIMG_5311.jpeg (3.01 MiB) Viewed 8986 timesIMG_5307.jpeg (2.94 MiB) Viewed 8986 timesIMG_4438.JPG (133.47 KiB) Viewed 8986 timesIMG_4437.JPG (195.22 KiB) Viewed 8986 timesIMG_4440.JPG (175.08 KiB) Viewed 8986 timesIMG_4087.JPG (307.71 KiB) Viewed 8986 timesIMG_6257.jpeg (1.34 MiB) Viewed 8986 timesIMG_0123.JPG (1.3 MiB) Viewed 8986 timesIMG_0111-1.JPG (1.37 MiB) Viewed 8986 timesIMG_0109-1.JPG (1.68 MiB) Viewed 8986 times",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=166784&sid=1295a4e656b2244f1ec7559aaf665aec#p166784

He sent me three tracks that he recorded on his own: soprano, tenor and flute. We both agreed the flute track wasn’t worthy.In the meantime, I worked on the rest of the instruments.

Most recordings and performances play at a breakneck tempo, but I decided to slow it down to give it more of a laid back funk flavor. I wanted to create something that sounded like it came out of a 60's session recording using period-appropriate instrumentation.All instruments were played/programmed by me. I had a few goals for this recording:Feature a jazz guitar and see how close I could come to programming a performance that sound like a humanUse a jazz brush drum kit to help emphasize the laid back groove and take the biting edge offThis recording features Orange Tree Samples’ Evolution Jazz Archtop Guitar and Fluffy Audio’s Jazz Drums - Brushes virtual instruments.

The piano is the Mellow Upright, pretty much straight out of the Electro 6D with just a wee bit of extra reverb and compression on the track. The organ is also from Electro, both upper and lower manuals. Again, just a small amount of track processing.And yes, the piano solo is borrowed from another tune.

It seems to be clearest, fullest, and generally best sounding of all the keyboards I've had.   Our bass player said it's the first keyboard I've used that didn't clash with his bass on the low notes!I like that it's a performance keyboard with the important settings at my fingertips, without searching through display pages.

Ive gone through several boards before I worked my way up to the magnificent Stage 3. Like many I chased that perfect piano sound and as far as digital instruments go the Nord is about as close as that gets for me.So .... a little story that is long overdue but which I am excited to share...A few months ago I was early to meet someone and decided to pass time by swinging into our local piano dealer (acoustic pianos only both new/used). Usually the place is full of old junk and a few nice Yamaha and Kawai grands that are out of my budget. I played a couple of uprights and as I was working my way around tucked away in the corner I spotted a shiny black baby grand which caught my eye. A second hand Young Chang G157 with a price tag at roughly the price of a Nord Stage 3So I sat to have a go not expecting much of it, and it simply blew me away. The action was so light and responsive, allowing so much expression. The sound filled the room and just sustained and resonated for what seemed like forever and I looked at my 10 year old daughter in amazement as her face beamed and we both went... WOW!! It sounds amazing. I just couldn't stop playing it, and walking around it. I played a Yamaha G5 next to it that was Much more expensive, then a Kawai GL30, again 5x the price. Back to the Young Chang and by far I preferred it, it just had something special about it.We went home thinking about it more and more. I couldnt strictly afford to just buy it, but never have I wanted an instrument so much. Truth be told, I havent been doing much live work recently due to other commitments and I was starting to feel sorry for my Stage 3 seeing little stage action. I toyed with selling it to buy this grand that knocked my socks off, but I CANT, I CANT sell my Stage 3.Anyway we called by again, and played it again, which was a bad mistake as it just made me want it moreA month later and a third visit, and the Stage 3 had been advertised for sale, and a deposit left. It had won me over and the Grand was coming home with me before someone else bought it.So we have had her since April and I really dont know how I have not bought an acoustic piano much much sooner. I play it every day and just love it to bits, it just connects with me on a whole new level and the best part about it, it didn't have to come at the highest price in the shop. Its taught me that as good as digital sounds can be, chasing a great piano sound doesnt have to mean you need the newest of digital kit, and your musical heart could well be sitting in your used piano dealer somewhere nearIt has even been given a name (Eleanor) thanks to my 10 year oldAnd here it is.My daughter loves it tooAnd a final note, the Stage 3 sale fell through so decided to keep it anyway(bank manager not happy! )Thanks for reading folks",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=118939&sid=1295a4e656b2244f1ec7559aaf665aec#p118939

Good choice.Before buying my upright, I tested a lot of grand and upright pianos. I tested some Young Chang models and they were surprisingly great comparing to the price.Electronic and acoustic instrument are for me complementary. This is not the same use.I own an old 30yo Seiler Upright which works perfectly (one tuning by year is enough) and I recently switch my Roland RD-300GX to NS3. I mainly use the NS3, because I can play when I want without making noise in the house: in fact, I mainly play after my daughter goes to bed. And I obvisouly cannot take my upright to play with my band and I can use a lot more sounds with the NS3.Nothing can replace playing with an acoustic piano. Electronic boards can only mimic piano on a record or through PA, but cannot mimics all the range of sound variations an acoustic piano can produce.An acoustic piano doesn't only produce sounds, but there is also an interaction between the piano and the player.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=118980&sid=1295a4e656b2244f1ec7559aaf665aec#p118980

Nothing serious, quick tinkleKActually, the ""quick tinkle"" is where it's all at.  Being able to sit down at an acoustic instrument when convenient, and have enjoyable sounds come out.  I do this maybe 3-4 times a day.  I think there's an inventory of 40+ songs/patterns I play.  More would be good, but I still work for a living.Right now, I'm in my summer place with a Yamaha AvantGrand N3.  Super stiff action, it's like going to the gym.  Sonically, it's a blast as it's always in perfect tune, well amplified, etc.  It has a volume control, which is helpful when I don't want to blast.  The EPs and harpsichords voices are fun as well.  It does not suck as a capable instrument.  No regrets with this baby.In a few weeks, I'll be back to my main place in Florida.  The Bosie 200 reigns supreme.  I can't imagine a better instrument for the space.  It helps to define the house.  When people are visiting, I'll play something, and life edges into an alternate musical dimension.  People are entranced by the sound and how it permeates through the house.  When I don't play, there are quiet complaints.Little ones will stop watching videos, and come watch me play, entranced.

My father was a musical man himself who was regarded as one of the top brass players in the British Army in the mid to late 70's and he loved a performance of any kind of live music. He could play a little piano too, but preferred to listen to me play as I grew up to be the only real piano player in the family and proudly came to plenty of my gigs over the years. My dad was a mere 63 and his passing was sudden and unexpected - this is still hurting heavily. His estate afforded me some funds and early 2022 I was struggling with grief, and looking for anything to pull me up somewhat. I know if there was anything he would have wanted me to have then a real deal piano would have been it. Don't get me wrong there is absolutely nothing wrong with a Young Chang G157 and it was what I could afford at the time, but there is no denying that this is a budget instrument and lacking in overall body below middle C. I set about looking for a more substantial instrument to own in honour of my late father.After some searching some large dealers and playing lots of pianos I was struggling to come across anything which really grabbed my attention. There really are some ghastly and uninspiring instruments out there, some with names on which one would not expect. A trip further afield to a huge piano warehouse left me spoilt for choice but among the noise I stumbled across a particular beautiful reconditioned Yamaha C6 that just had that special something after playing it only for a few seconds. It growled when I played the left hand bass notes and sang so perfect in the mids and highs I was just hooked on a new cloud of sound experience and couldn't find anything to dislike about it. It reminded me of when I discovered the Young Chang and my ears pricking up with interest only this was on a whole new level. The dealer was happy to take in the YC as part exchange so I did the deal. I've owned her a while now and felt it was time to update my acoustic journey thread. Unlike the old piano it doesn't have a name (yet) and my daughter has fallen out of love with piano in favour of learning guitar which is a shame, but it has inspired me to play even more than I ever have and its very specialHere is my father, playing my first Nord, the Piano 2HP (which I will say he was very impressed with), and the C6 - a magnificent instrument. I just wish my father was here to see and play it..... but I don't get a choice in that matterI can only play it in his memory now.If you are still with me.

In this picture, you can also see the 2nd tier struts I made for my K&M 18880 stand. The design was inspired by the original Invisible Stand, one of which I still own:I use a small pedal board with this group. I output the synth lead patches out Output 3 on the Stage and route it through a Moog Minifooger MF Drive pedal and Seymour Duncan Vapor Trail analog delay. The Moog filter in the Drive pedal gives a nice warm fatness to the sound, which works well with the old-school analog delay.I have to say that it's not really necessary to bring all this stuff out. The Stage will cover all my needs for almost everything except heavy organ playing (the HP action is not ideal for anything other than simple technique), so the Electro is kind of superfluous. I actually only used it on two songs the entire night.

(and congrats on your recent retirement! welcome to the club)I like your approach to using the NS3C up top as the do-all sound maker. Given that 95% of what I do is piano (big band and cocktail-style jazz combos), the two-keyboard rig is actually useless most of the time. I'm better off occasionally supplementing the Stage with something on top than to control it from down below. Now if the fusion band were to pick up a bit more, I would give more consideration to a controller up top like the Arturia Keylab 61 mkII.Too bad it doesn't come in Red.Putting the key of the song right into the song name isn't nerdy??",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=124221&sid=1295a4e656b2244f1ec7559aaf665aec#p124221

I too have joined the 2-Nord Club.I had been trying to figure out a solution for a backup for my NS3-HA88, which I used as a single-board rig. I was getting way too nervous when I powered up for the first time at gig, knowing if there was an issue, I (and the band) would be out-of-luck.Only 10-15 of the 75 or so songs in my band's repertoire (mostly keyboard-driven or featured) have a single AP/EP program and/or a simple split with an organ. The rest involve some combination of 2-way/3-way splits, customized synths with effects, morphs and multiple programs for different parts of a song. After trying a Juno-DS61 and a MODX7 (both great values for their price range, by the way), I came to the conclusion that it wasn't practical to re-create what I needed to survive a gig with either board, which resulted in my getting an NS3 Compact. It's 2/3 the size of the HA88 and just a little more than 1/2 the weight.  Other than converting about 20 programs with splits to have both 88-key and 73-key friendly versions, all I need to do now is a two-minute backup and restore process from one keyboard to the other to keep them in-sync.The first gig, I kept the NS3C in a case on standby, then realized that was a waste and now run a 2-tier setup with a K&M 18880 and modified 18881 stacker.  I drilled an additional set of holes to bring the top tier closer to the bottom tier and cut 3"" off the support arms so they didnt stick out over the keybed of the bottom board. The pins aren't needed as I use marine weathersripping to securely keep the NS3C from sliding on the top tier.  I really like the virtual invisibility of the 18880, the stability, and the ease of transport and setup.I'm moving some of the parts I play to the NS3C to reduce the number of program changes in a song and to add parts that I wasn't able to cover in a single board. I also have the benefit of bringing my entire set of sounds in a more compact format for rehearsals and casual situations where dragging a large 88-keyboard around isn't practical.Finally, yes, Song Mode is great.  I set all my programs up in alphabetical order, then use Song Mode to set up my setlist for the evening, which is really helpful for the songs that use multiple programs.  The rest of the songs are placed at the end in alphabetical order so they are easy to find if needed.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=124259&sid=1295a4e656b2244f1ec7559aaf665aec#p124259

Yes, it's a bit of a splurge, but a 36-month 0% interest promo helps keep things cash-flow positive, although I'll try to stay out of the new equipment game for a while (famous last words)!I do like the narrower pedestal look for standing while playing.  Keeping the width to 18"" also gives me clear access to all the jacks on the back of the NS3 and mostly eliminates any side-to-side sway and twist for me.  Still working on optimizing the pedal arrangement since I use sustain, control, organ swell and rotor switch for each, but I have plenty of room and the feet don't really get in the way of where I like to place the pedals.From what I read on KC, it seems like K&M is discontinuing the 18880 but is possibly coming out with a new model.  It would be interesting to see how they would improve it.  Maybe they'll make it height adjustable without tools.

I agree with your assessment of the 18880 and would add that the minimalist look and virtual invisibility on a stage are huge benefits too. I think the marketing photos do a disservice to the stand and make it look stodgy, which isn’t the case, but likely contributed to lower sales numbers.  The Spider Pro and the Stay stands look super cool if a conspicuous stand is important. Part of me says to buy an extra now, but another part says to wait and see what K&M does for a replacement and get an 18800 at a clearance price later.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=124379&sid=1295a4e656b2244f1ec7559aaf665aec#p124379

I hope this correction improves things.I'm following up in this thread, as I was asked about my bespoke 2nd tier for the K&M 18880 stand. This could have easily gone into another thread, and I can cross post if needed.Anyway, I've had some inquiries about the 2nd tier specs, and I want to share them. The tier design was inspired by the old Invisible Stands from the 1980's, which I think were the best keyboard stands ever made. I still have one in great shape, but don't use it for gigs because it's a bit too tall for playing while seated. The design is great because it brings the upper keyboard very close to the lower one.The first picture includes the dimensions that I created. I first made a template out of cardboard, trimming to get the sized and angles I wanted. I've included measurements in both English and metric, and got as close as I could for accuracy. Please note that the drawing itself is not to scale, so don't try to make a template directly from it.The important thing to note is that only a few of these numbers are critical. The post in the middle need to fit into the tube of the K&M stand. You can see in the picture below that I added a shim to the post so that it is wide enough to not wobble while in the stand. Had I used a wider piece of wood that would not have been necessary. The other critical number is the 1-18""/2.9cm just in front of the post, as it determines how the tier will sit on the front rail of the stand.The distance from the post to the front was driven by how far forward my lower keyboard sits on the stand; If you use a deeper lower keyboard, this will be narrower. Likewise, the front height dimension is based on how high I wanted the front of the upper tier to be, and the tilt angle by how I wanted to view the upper tier. The triangle section at the rear is a stabilizer that supports the weight of the upper keyboard.The black triangles are areas I shaved off largely for aesthetics. The exception is the small piece in front of the post. The K&M has a weld spot there, so the corner needed to be rounded off to fit correctly.There is a flat top piece that sits on top of the wedge to provide a wider stable sitting area for the upper board. The whole thing was finished with black paint and clear coat.Here are a few pictures of the unpainted finished product:And painted:The stuff on the top is that gooey pad that people put on their car dashboards to stick their mobile phones on, just cut to fit. It seemed like a cheap way to keep the upper keyboard from sliding.I hope someone finds this useful.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=155077&sid=1295a4e656b2244f1ec7559aaf665aec#p155077

The only thing left to do is to get the right side of the studio (Nord, Blooper, and Moog semi-modulars) MIDI-synced to the MPC for when I'm doing more rhythmic stuff.c19825441c48eec1127281f7cb6224e3362b3d06_2_664x500.jpeg (132.3 KiB) Viewed 7079 times",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=159847&sid=1295a4e656b2244f1ec7559aaf665aec#p159847

She left a small inheritance which I turned into two guitars and amps, mics, Logic Pro, etc. I started transforming part of my basement into a small recording studio this past summer.While mixing and mastering my first song, I met a remarkable audio engineer, Michael DiVestea, who helped me pick up some Logic Pro skills much more quickly than I would have on my own. (I connected with Michael through fiverr.com.) I shared with him that I was interested in a keyboard/midi controller.My first song can be found here:https://johndavidfarrell.hearnow.com/I had almost purchased a Native Instruments Komplete Control S88 mk3 before Michael brought to my attention his Nord Stage 3 HA 88. He spoke highly of its versatility and quality. I dug around this forum, nordkeyboards.com, YouTube, etc. It captured my imagination and heart. I took delivery of my Nord Stage 3 HA 88 this weekend. The Roland KC-600 amp that will bring it to life is on backorder; hope to see it in 3-4 weeks. I plug it into my studio monitors for now. I'll be learning to use this instrument for years.

The single 15” woofer has a horrible midrange, which is where the majority of your piano quality sound is going to be. The small tweeter is simply not powerful enough to handle the necessary mid-highs. You will get a sound that is deep, muddy and with a lack of clarity.This is an amp design from the 70’s for the most part. Digital pianos and synthesizers have come a very long way since then, and this design is not equipped to keep up. They are loud, heavy, expensive and (as someone on the Keyboard Corner once wrote) “horribly, horribly reliable.”You are much better off putting your money toward a pair of decent studio monitors for a studio-only rig. In my studio, I use a pair of old Gemini 8” powered studio monitors. While they are not world class, they sound a whole lot better in my studio than the old Crate Keyboard amp I had (it was a very similar design to the Roland KC).If you plan to play out, a pair of QSC CP-8’s or similar from Yamaha or Electro Voice will serve you well.

A modern class-D amp will be smaller, lighter, cheaper, more powerful and with a MUCH better sound. Which studio monitors are you using now? Most likely, you already have a better sound than the Roland would provide. The Nord Monitors are high quality but expensive (as anything Nord). As mentioned, you might research a pair of good 6' or 8' monitors, or even some small full-range speakers like the EV ZX-A1 or QSC K8. These are probably too much for just a small studio, but would be great if you ever plan on taking them out on a gig.Also, don't forget the used market! You may find some great bargains there and, if you don't like what you get, you will lose much less money in reselling it.Have fun in your new musical journey!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=152252&sid=79fd2d4a74a7f9ec1a03368c89829b58#p152252

A few lessons on technique would not hurt, but really aren't necessary to enjoy the instrument.   The White Grand (and just about anything on a Nord) sounds great, even with very simple and sparse music.  The tone quality is good enough that you can sound long tones, and they sound good with resonance, reverb, etc.  From there, maybe try learning different scales in different keys, then different chord positions, then tying them together in various ways -- and it all sort of flows from there.  Or just try to play things that sound good to you.The only time I have sought out instruction (formal or informal) is when I've encountered something I didn't know how to do, and I wanted to do it.  You can learn a lot from Youtube, by the way.EDIT: there are many people on this forum who would qualify as ""professional"" pianists, and I am not one of them.

I dont know much about bouzouki, but there is one major shift in thinking that might help you. Bouzouki and the human voice are very unrestricted intonation-wise. As in: you can tune or bend strings differently to get different colours, or just sing a bit higher or lower. With piano and other instruments (especially if you stick with TET), the tuning is kept precisely as it is, and different inversions will not only determine register and note density, but also how ""out of tune"" notes are against each other. Take C major for example. Play it in 1st inversion, with an added C one octave lower, and you get a very static, maybe uneasy sound. Then play another inversion: C2, G2, E3. It is not only more spread out, but i feel like the intonation is nicer as it is.EDIT: this example is my subjective experience. Do what you want with it. I'll keep playing my spread out voicings.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=151863&sid=79fd2d4a74a7f9ec1a03368c89829b58#p151863

When playing alone, each person has a slightly different idea of where and when to hit the notes. It required a lot of splicing and nudging in Cubase to line everyone up. That was rather tedious to do, but I think it was worth it in the end.I appreciate your comment about the selection of the piano sound. I actually chose the Amber precisely for its lyrical fundamental tone. I'm a big fan of the jazz recordings of the 50's and the pianos were always very fundamental forward without a lot of bright overtone. I know it had a lot to do with the ability of the recording technology of the time, but I really like that sound.I knew the tenor player has a lush classic style and I wanted the piano to match that. I also have this notion that, in big band music, the piano is not supposed to cut through but rather accentuate the other instruments. The Amber is ideal for that because of it's rich mid-voice and softer highs and lows.The next one is a bit more uptempo and will feature a bit of piano solo, but I'm debating if it should be AP or EP. If it's AP, I'll probably use the White Grand for its all-around versatility. Either that or Native Instruments The Grandeur sample. I'll be tinkering with those over the next few weeks.Thanks again for your comments!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=131733&sid=79fd2d4a74a7f9ec1a03368c89829b58#p131733

That was really well done.You talked about the challenge to sync the parts. Were the sax players in general playing more behind the beat? (sax is my main instrument).Thanks!Everyone is recording on their own against a sparse backing track. They don’t have the benefit of keying off the lead instrument, so the accuracy is not there.I start out by creating a backing “shell” in Band-In-A-Box with drums, bass and guitar. I move the tracks into Cubase, add a sparse piano track and a click track. I then remove the drum track from the shell and send it to the drummer to record his part. I also send a shell without the bass line to the bass player so he can record his part. Once the drummer’s part is in, it goes to the rest of the band to record their parts individually. As parts come in, I add them to the project.What tends to happen is that everyone has their own slight interpretation differences which results in each section having a rather loose sound When you put them together. In the saxes, the two altos are usually pretty on par with the exception of some slight accent/dynamics differences. They both tend to play in front of the beat. The tenor player played slightly behind the beat, which sort of dragged the section a bit so I nudged him up a bit. Bari is a tough instrument. It’s a big horn and it takes time to the air to get through, which then sounds like late notes. I moved him up a lot because I wanted each section to sound punchy and the bari is the key to that punch for the saxes.There were other cases where someone held a note out too long or not long enough, so I made some corrections there as well. The trombones presented a few challenges as well. Bone 1 has a rather mellow and smooth sound while Bones 2 and 3 were rather punchy and bright. They also had a few rhythmic misgivings.If you listen to the America The Beautiful recordings, you’ll hear it more clearly. The audio track on the video has very few rhythmic adjustments and not a whole lot of EQ/dynamics blending, while the remixed audio recording on SoundCloud is much clearer. You can hear each section with better definition. I took a lot of time on the remix to line up the rhythmic elements so the hits and counterpoints would stand out.Overall, this continues to be a great learning experience for me as a hack audio engineer.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=131761&sid=79fd2d4a74a7f9ec1a03368c89829b58#p131761

I try to always learn new things with these projects.This is a 5/4 time rendition of Greensleeves, the traditional waltz. It started mostly as an exercise in meter. I wanted to see if the tune could be adapted to 5/4 time, and experimented with some small polyrhythm phrases. There are examples of 4 over 5, 6 over 5 and 8 over 5 throughout.I had two sources of inspiration. The first is a recording of Take Five by Acoustic Alchemy, which has this reggae type groove that I really liked. Some of the sound profile such as the synth comping were based on that recording. The other element was Brubeck's Blue Rondo a la Turk, a song I've like since first hearing Al Jarreau's rendition in the early 80's.As I started to work through the arrangement, it took on a life of its own (no surprise there). The instrumentation is largely comprised of stock and custom-programmed patches from Arturia's V-Collection, using the Synclavier, Matrix 12, SQ-80 and Casio CZ engines. Drums are a combination of battery from Ujam's DEEP and cymbals/percussion from Steinberg Groove Agent. There's a Roland SA ePiano patch from my RD-800 buried in there as well. This track uses effects to a greater extent than anything I've done previously.Nord spotting: The acoustic piano is the Silver Grand, run through Arturia's Mello-Fi effect. My first attempt at adding lo-fi stuff.Unlike my past ventures, the bass and drum parts are largely original. The drums are based on the groove I mentioned above with the embellishments courtesy of Groove Agent. I started with a Band In A Box baseline, but ended up crafting my own to fit the groove.Not sure I'm done polishing it yet, but I wanted to share.

This rather large bird with yellow and black plumage prefers to live in the crowns of tall trees and rarely appears in open spaces.When moving through the treetops, a pair of golden orioles are most likely to either perform what sounds like a genuine flute duet with fanciful variations or simply communicate by using harsh calls that resemble yowls of a cat whose tail has been stepped on.This review contains a transcript of the sounds recorded in June during daylight hours featuring songs and calls of golden orioles accompanied by other birds, insects, wind, and other sounds of nature. These soundscapes were recorded in the depths of a mixed forest where a set of microphones captured a stereo panorama. The captured soundscapes are that of a meadow with a diameter of about 100 meters that produces a multi-level echo and deep reverb.The recording session begins in the early hours, and a soft breeze can be heard moving the crowns of deciduous and coniferous trees in a sonic imitation of the sea surf, somewhat drowning out the bustle of morning birds. The golden oriole sings in the distance but its legato melody is clearly audible in the center of the stereo panorama and completely fills the background thanks to the layered echo of a forest meadow.Listen to Golden oriole song accompanied by other birds:Closer to noon, the chirping of grasshoppers and bush-crickets comes to the foreground of the soundscape, creating a truly meditative environment, especially with the recurring rustle of the wind. Shifting a little to the right, the golden oriole spreads its song through the meadow, now complemented by muted calls of other birds including thrushes, wagtails, and swallows.Listen to Golden oriole song accompanied by insects and other birds:By afternoon, the wind significantly picks up and completely masks all sounds produced by insects and birds, except for the loud communication between the pair of golden orioles still audible in the left channel. The couple alternates the scandalous call with their usual song performed in a higher register, and their voices gradually subside as the birds retire into the depths of the forest. Here you can also hear the creak of a tree swaying in the wind.Listen to Golden orioles' talk accompanied by wind and other birds:In the next soundscape, the golden oriole is localized in the left channel, while on the right you can hear the shrill call of the shrike and the distant song of another golden oriole. The wind, grasshoppers, and other birds also continue to harmonize.Listen to Golden oriole song accompanied by wind:For your relaxation, here is another extended soundscape from June of this year recorded in the afternoon. The recording features the sounds of birds and insects of the grassy meadow sheltered in a dense forest far from urban or industrial areas. On this hot summer day, the insects not once interrupted their song throughout the heatwave while the wind intensified and abated, revealing small details such as the small hammering sound in the left channel. This is the sound of a song thrush attempting to break the shell of a grape snail against the stone to eat the slug inside. Spans of swallows and insects sometimes interrupt the idyllic soundscape by moving right in front of the microphones. Golden orioles can also be heard moving closer from time to time.Listen to Woodland sounds—bird calls, insects, and wind recorded on a summer morning:The soundscapes are processed with analog equipment and the maximum playback volume does not exceed their naturally-occurring volume levels, so you can listen to it without fear of hearing fatigue.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=139885&sid=79fd2d4a74a7f9ec1a03368c89829b58#p139885

They wanted me toalternatebetween those, for three hours.  And I did: ""Stairway To Heaven"" unabashedly followed ""The Easy Winners"", which followed ""Back In Black"", etc..  ALL ON PIANO ALONE.As a keyboardist, my main takeaway was a newfound respect for the Stride Left Hand.  What a freaking workout that was.  It's one thing to play a couple of rags as a throwaway, but 90 minutes' worth!?Confession: there were about four rags that I really wanted to learn, but there was only so much time to practice in advance.  So for just those, I sequenced the left hand.  Cringe, you say?  Well, no, that freed me to add density to the right-hand part with both hands, which was its own fun.

Hectic weekend for me every year but this was the exception. Coming off from night shift on Saturday morning, 1st day of 3 in club championship (golf) and its my wedding anniversary. Day two back to the golf coarse, finish up and clean up for a 2.5hr drive where my band was playing the ""Freaks Olympics"" Had no idea what we were getting into, we were told P.A system is there. Once we arrived went to check out the stage and P.A, look around there is no P.A on the stage, there is no P.A anywhere!! Finally find our contact they direct us into the saloon where the P.A was located. Finally check it out and blow off probably 3/16"" of dust from the mixer, can't get s*** working and close to calling it off and cut our losses. Finally we get it to work move the stuff outside and hooked up 15 min before we go on stage. No time to freshen up but enough time to smash a beer or two and on we go. The smell of weed was everywhere and trust me we seen all kinds of people in all types of attire. Anyway turned out to be a great venue girls flashing us and the weirdest dude was wearing a sequined blazer, top hat, and nothing else on just strolling around. Once again it was a great night packed up and drove home made it home by 4:30am took a cat nap and played day 3 in club championship for 3rd place.

All sounds with all their imperfections (or not) are hard programmed MIDI files. But as long as you get the BeatBuddy and not its little brother, you can adjust any rhythm with a MIDI editor.So no way to adjust to play a given rhythm in 55%, 60%, 66% or 70% swing on the fly. But you can choose from  included, additionally bought, community driven or custom made beats.Today, I got mine. And am happy with it. Maybe, it's true that the presets are a bit 'full' of hits. You have to look a bit to get beats that don't tend to make too much of a wind. But on the other side, that's exactly what you'll like in the beginning: having a lot of 'sound' even if you miss a chord on your piano. Will it help practising or not? - Don't know yet.Thanks, Normhart, for the hint!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=148060&sid=79fd2d4a74a7f9ec1a03368c89829b58#p148060

So, I never thought how it was made, but it could have been done with a overdubing Farfisa (one for swell in, other to atack and swell out)  or, easily with a synth (controling sweel, fast attack and slow dacay)  . I still use my Roland FA07 for this sound when playing live, so the hammond on the NE5 is ready for the next part. But a nice way to do it on the Electro is to use the SOLINA VIOLIN sample with fast attack and slow decay with vibe effect added and some reverb.We have recorded another video with this song.

We normally start a recording session of improvised music as a trio. These are sink or swim 100% improvisations. We sometimes use a chord framework or mostly just jump right in to it. Then we hope to find some jam worthy portions and post them on the web. Other musicians from around the world are then free to add their new parts to our tracks and post those results as a V-jam or Cyber-Jam. We have some incredible musicians contributing to this body of work.We have hundreds of tracks  posted on the mothership. My ISP is very rural, so have patience on downloads. The results vary according to the players on that session or cyber-jam. The styles include rock, jazz, blues, progressive. This includes traditional and experimental tracks. There are no musical rules.This is your invitation to record some improvised music. To hear the NS3 piano in action check our Jam 4 Jeff (Lorber) southern style track. Fans of Alan Holdsworth need to check out Hugh Ferguson on guitar on the cyber-jams page. If you find a track you want to record let me know and I can build a mix with more room for your parts, if it is needed.

I think she feels safer knowing the monitors are there.The Mellotron is the band‘s, so i took it over as given. It’s a „Mellotron“, which counts as a genuine Instrument. The patches they’d set up are mostly layered, so they‘d take up two synth slots, which means I wouldn’t have any left over for the bass. Plus, I like the ergonomics of the setup, and the mello looks nice on the setup.The band grudgingly accepts the Nord as more than just a „Substitute“ despite being a fake organ and fake piano.I mean, they cart around a freaking vibraphone.Yeah, the keys are five channels of DI (Nord is stereo out plus mono on Channel 3 for the bass). Plus one for accordion when we have it along. The FOH guy is their own.As for mics: yeah.

I've been playing piano for 17 years, a Nord user for 4 four years, and a lurker of this forum for a couple of those.I upgraded from a Nord Piano 2 to the Nord Grand last year, and was having some annoyance with my flimsy metal stand shifting around too much while playing aggressively. Missing the feel of playing on an acoustic piano and not being able to justify spending ~$800 on Nord's official wooden stand, I decided to build my own! It's made to look like an old upright piano base, and really feels like it with the sturdiness it provides.Thanks for reading/ taking a look!

I studied classical piano but love progressive rock just as much (international classics like Genesis, ELP and King Crimson as well as italian prog 'classics' like PFM, Le Orme and Banco del Mutuo Soccorso).In my teenage years I played in several bands, spanning from rock/hard rock covers (mostly such as Deep Purple and Pink Floyd) to italian classics (like De André) and folk-rock original music.In those years, beside my vertical acoustic piano, I played whatever keyboard I could find or borrow, proudly including my brother's toy(?) Bontempi MRS 49 (which had in general terrible sounds but ""strings"" that sounded astonishingly similar to launeddas!). Luckily I eventually managed to buy an Alesis QS8.2 first and a Roland RS-70 later.The latter kept me from insanity during my Engineering studies (far from home and from my piano) and later on.Last summer, after 12 looong years living without a properly-weighted piano, and after spending a year looking for a satisfying piano, I bought a Nord Grand and could not be happier with my choice!Now I can finally re-train my fingers on a proper keybed, enjoy the awesome Nord sounds and get back to where i left...Cheers to you all!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=137476&sid=79fd2d4a74a7f9ec1a03368c89829b58#p137476

Merl was well known in jazz circles, played with Miles Davis, Bonnie Raitt, B.B. King.  Son Tony's first keyboard lesson was from family friend Herbie Hancock.  Sly Stone gave him an organ when he was 10.   He got into Bass when Tom Fogerty, John Fogerty's (both in Creedence Clearwater Revival) brother gave him a Fender Bass. He's played Bass with Stevie Wonder, Sly Stone. Jerry Garcia, David Crosby, Steve Stills, Eric Clapton, and Chaka Khan.  Oh, he's won 2 Emmy Awards also.  Good man, loves working and nurturing young musicians.  I was good friends, and kind of dated Jim Campilongo's sister.  Met Jim when I was a better guitar player than he decades ago.

I began playing about a year and a half ago, and I've been playing every day since.  There's a group of us at work that get together and jam on fridays and that's done wonders for my playing.  I've played guitar for 25 years now, so switching to a new instrument has been very inspiring.Since I'm new to the keyboard, I wanted to give myself a project before I dropped a ton of money on a Nord, so I started building speakers and a keyboard stand.  Other than music, woodworking is my main hobby, so it was a natural fit.I started with the speakers, mahogany, roughly 2'x1'x1', it was my first foray into crossovers, but the internet is apparently full of wisdom these days.Then it was on to the stand, both the base and the top.  I wasn't sure if I was going for a two keyboard setup at first, but more storage is never a bad thing.Then the baseThen it was just a matter of putting it all together and making a few purchases:Here it is all buttoned up:And then here it is open and ready for business:I've only had my Stage 3 for a week, but I am so very impressed with it.

More than that I suppose, I didn't just want the drawer to be strong enough, I wanted it to have no wobble in it whatsoever.So, I drastically overbuild everything.  The locking drawer slides that I used aren't your usual drawer slides.  they're 3"" tall and 3/4"" thick and rated at up to 500 lbs.https://www.ovisonline.com/14-Locking-D ... P2412.aspxIn addition to the drawer slides, the drawer itself is designed to be very strong.  Made with a combination of 3/4 plywood and solid mahogany, its vaguely triangular in shape.  The front of the drawer is narrow so it doesn't knock into your knees when playing, but the back of the drawer is 3"" thick.  Inside the drawer it's got support struts much like an airplane wing.  When I finished building it I stood on it and couldn't feel any flex in the drawer itself.  Here's a good shot of the profile on the drawer:Finally, none of that strength matters if the drawer slides aren't attached to the base the right way.  I was concerned about using screw in wood, since over time they might loosen.  So I put brass inserts into the base and bolted everything up tight.With all that done, I'm happy to say that there's no wobble or ""bounce"" at all in the final product.  If someone ever does something violent enough to break the drawer, the keyboard would have been damaged anyway.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=122478&sid=79fd2d4a74a7f9ec1a03368c89829b58#p122478

Rev2 is a very nice sounding instrument, but if you are used to Nord, you need to be prepared for a leap back in convenience of interface. Everything just takes time to set up on the Rev2 and many design choices just don't seem logical to me.@harmonizer: now you note it. Well, you probably know how it goes with mixing, right?

The structure provides the elements with their specific, perhaps changing, meaning in nano timbre/ time.This information comes from so-called transients whereby the duration varies between a small part of a period, from 1 usec to 3 or 4 milliseconds.'Articulation' functioning as identity.This onset as impulse makes it possible to distinguish the identities of these sonic forms and transforming them to autonomous audio sculptures.The structure works as a context.The elements determine which structural measures they can be subjected to in order for their identity to be enhanced, for their meaning to be differentiated and extended.Roland Emile Kuit - KYMAiTUNEShttp://itunes.apple.com/nl/album/sonic-forms/1457276825AMAZONhttp://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXNSH77/ref ... =1-1-spellSPOTIFYhttp://open.spotify.com/album/2j4bZMTHJ2AIG1jeFJPxICPreview SONY / The Orchard",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=115418&sid=94f4a6d600304a9e02524c42b83ab672#p115418

In addition, engineers know that understanding the physics of how pendulums behave is an important step towards understanding motion, gravity, inertia and centripetal force.P = period; which is the time for one pendulum swing [sec]l = length from the fixed point at the top of the pendulum to the center of mass of the bob [m]g = gravitational constant (9.8 m per sec2)π ≈ 3.14 (dimensionless constant)My approach is usingORBITSas concept. Integrating technology on a conceptual level, does not imply greater stylistic and aesthetic complexity. On the contrary,technology has the function of relocating the potential of creativity to a different conceptual realm. This relatively new situation has a direct impact on the ability to convey eclectic musical ideas and suddenly many more creative options are available. Again, effectiveness of the musical message is not related to the complexity of the concept itself. This relies on the context, the aesthetics and the function of the technology involved. From the standpoint of innovation, the ideas resulting from the use of technology are to be supported by substantial arguments to justify their novelty, as an attempt to merge musical developments with the technological.On PROSTUDIOMASTERSDownload:https://www.prostudiomasters.com/album/page/31963On KKBOX JapanDownload:https://www.kkbox.com/jp/ja/album/3sBG2 ... index.html",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=115464&sid=94f4a6d600304a9e02524c42b83ab672#p115464

I have been using Yamaha's all my live, from the early PSR, a 9000 pro, several clavinova's and stage piano's, until now only having my good old Yamaha Dx7s left.A couple of years ago I decided to switch to a Nord Stage 2ex, and never, ever regretted it. Although the deep menu's of the Yamaha will get familiar after using it for hours, the simple setup and user interface of the Nord is incredible. I loved the organ and piano sounds as well right away.After having troubles with the keys making noise on the 2EX 76, I swapped it for a stage 3 76 - unfortunately I was not told I could not transfer any of my programs. Took me a couple of weeks to redo everything, but I am back again. After the latest OS updates, finally having the right list view, dual keyboard options for complete panel B back, I am completely happy.Live, I use the Yamaha dx7 and Nord, connected via midi, and an iPad with ForScore and 1Chart. Besides, I use an Alesis Vortex keytar to play the Nord while walking the stage. In the near future, I am looking for:- some nice programs and patches for new covers we will play- knowledge how to completely setup the dx7 using the external Midi section of the Nord- knowledge on how to use iPad software to organise sheet music and directly setup the two keyboards.Please don't hesitate to contact if you see any need for it, and hope to get and find input for my questions!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=114273&sid=94f4a6d600304a9e02524c42b83ab672#p114273

I have a quad-core iMac retina with i7 and I still can't load it up with tons of plugins (I use a lot of Arturia V Collection) at 64 sample buffer. You can always tradeoff buffer (latency) for performance, to a point, but that really depends on your workflow. If you're 99% ""in the box"" and so input/output latency is less of a concern, then you can *probably* get away with a fast i5. But the CPU clock speed, more than the i5/i7 difference, is what you're going to want to take advantage of in this case. The math in most of these audio plugins is pretty simple and they usually aren't fully accelerated for SIMD and other tricks (though, sometimes, they are). But, it's technology. It costs a LOT and it becomes obsolete quickly, and it's never quite ""fast enough"" to do everything we want. Will the i7 ""feel"" like it's worth the money in the end? Probably not. Will the i5 be fast enough to do what you want? Only you can get a feeling for that answer. But the i7 will have a slightly higher resale value in the end (depending on how many years from now you sell it of course) and will probably be useful to you for longer, so if you're able to swing it, I don't see a reason not to.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=111619&sid=94f4a6d600304a9e02524c42b83ab672#p111619

Some DAWs do a very good job of using all the cores (I don't know which, offhand, but I would assume Logic should do that since it's an Apple product), but Ableton Live seems to need a mix of raw speed and cores to do a good job, and too much of either at the expense of the other is less good than a balance between the two. For reference, I'm using a 4GHz 4-core right now, and while my CPU meter rarely goes over 50%, I can easily force dropouts with low buffer sizes (64 and under) - this means only 2 of my four cores are used (the rough 50% loading) but they're fully used (hence the dropouts). My laptop, which has a 3.something GHz 2-core, will sit at nearly 70% CPU but perform about equally with the 4-core on the same Live project. This makes me think the number of cores in Live is less important than the CPU speed.Personally I find clock speed is more important than total cores. I would prefer a 4-core 2.6 over a 6 core 2.2. I find the number of cores doesn't translate as well to latency and VST performance as do the CPU raw speed, but that's my experience with my DAWs and video editing tools, again, YMMV.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=111747&sid=94f4a6d600304a9e02524c42b83ab672#p111747

But that's another discussion.Many workaround for your issue.Have one scene with your 8 mesures intro + 80 silent mesures + your sound again. -> One trigger lauches the whole song.Or have different scenes (ex: one for intro, another for outro) and trigger them with a controller, a note, a pad, a pedal, whatever... at the right moent (so if you miss or add a mesure somewhere in the song, you're not screwed at mesure 80 because you're not in sync anymore)Or have different scenes with informations on what to automaticaly do after playing. So that after scene ""Intro"" is played, it automaticaly plays scene ""Blank"" for 80 mesures, then passes to scene ""Outro"". So only one trigger but three differents scenes....

Soundlines of Contemporary Art”, which from September 25 to October 25 will engage the capital city with more than fifty international artists exhibiting in seven different locations around the city…“Soundlines of Contemporary Art”, curated by Mazdak Faiznia and Marina Hakobyan and created and organized by Shaula International LLC, is held under the high patronage of the Presidency of Armenia and the patronage of the Canadian Government, the Ministry of Culture of Armenia, the Ministry of Cultural Activities and Tourism of Italy, the cultural promotional project of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Italy Vivere All’italiana, the Italian Embassy in Armenia. The event is further supported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Armenia, the EU Delegation to Armenia and the Armenian General Benevolent Union (AGBU).Composer and sonic artist Roland Emile Kuit at the Aram Khachaturian MuseumComposer and sonic artist Roland Emile Kuit is considered a pioneer of the art form generally referred to as “sound installation”. He taught this form of audio art at the Vrije Academie The Hague, and introduced this sonic art to the installation area. A metamorphosis from the traditional speaker boxes into ‘sonic spaces’.Kuit’s sonic work ranges from experimental sound-architectural installations to acousmatic performances, often in cooperation with artists, designers and scientists. Kuit is researching chaotic systems, sound at atomic levels, morphology and decision-making processes beyond algorithm and stochastic approaches.Kuit lectures, performs/exhibits worldwide at universities, art galleries, museums and creative hubs.ACRYLIC INTONATIONS – Roland Emile KuitKuit was this year at the SONO Studios in Prague recording his latest work ‘Tactile Utterance’ for Tomas Rajlich with the Fama Q String Quartet. Kuit had the opportunity  to record a painting Tomas Rajlich in his atelier. For this occasion, Kuit had brought his ZOOM H6 recorder and connected 4 contact microphones to the canvas. As Rajlich was working, proportioning out and shaping the acrylic paint, Kuit managed to seize this sonic autograph in paint of Tomas Rajlich.These recordings were taken back to the Netherlands to Kuit’s studio. Here he had to find ways to deal with these raw recordings. The idea was to create a quadraphonic sonic art space by processing the material into sonic art. Roland used the Kyma system to analyse these sounds in the spectral realm.As Rajlich is modifying the appearance, hardness, flexibility, texture, and other characteristics of the paint surface, Kuit had to find a way to work likewise. Kuit’s idea of working in the spectral realm is that he can add more ways to deconstruct sound. He has now the possibility to separate frequencies, amplitudes and time, reconstructing sounds composing new textures.Kuit created from acrylic sounds the spectra used by Oscillator Banks of 256 separate oscillators. Each oscillator is associated with a partial from the time-varying spectrum given in the Spectrum field. As a result this data is modulated and articulated into the ‘sonic space’. Air as canvas, acrilyc has a voice now.The exhibition will have an official catalogue in two volumes and in English, published by Manfredi Edizioni, with opening sections by the President of the Republic of Armenia, the Minister of Culture of Armenia, the curators Mazdak Faiznia and Marina Hakobyan, and Shaula International LLC.http://donemus.nl/sonic-artist-roland-e ... -icae2018/http://panarmenian.net/m/eng/news/258074",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=105729&sid=94f4a6d600304a9e02524c42b83ab672#p105729

Electronic Frequencies:City scapes: Paris – AmsterdamSonic art and environmentalsComposer and sonic artist Roland Kuit has been exploring and broadening the language of sound for over 25 years. In search of new forms of listening Kuit started to create synthetic sonic environments in the ’90’s. Resulting in sound exhibitions in art galleries followed by publications in art magazines as l’Orbe and Avenue Magazine, Sound On Sound Magazine and WIRED. To free these sonic concepts from the traditional speaker boxes Kuit began the transition of his sounds into installations:1/ Paris (for Orbe magazine nr. 9. Music machine), Roland Kuit,1998Roland Emile Kuit is a composer of contemporary music whose works can be purchased at Ircam from the Center Georges Pompidou in Paris. This classical musician uses the flute, the harp, the bassoon, but also the direct sound recording (atmospheres of public places, interviews …). He also uses a computer with echo chambers with frequency modulation to work the sound as one carves the clay. The original audio CD of 20 ’32 “entitled Paris traces the wanderings of Kuit within this capital. The sounds of the Metro, the words of the students at the university campus, the winter and the melancholy of the lonely bassoon distorted by the computer are all distinguished.2/ Amsterdam (for Avenue Magazine, uitgave #5 VOL.2 Amsterdam inside out), Roland Kuit, 1995The canals as a blue waterline though this piece. Pigeons flying up and the sound of their wings morphing to the cadence of a street organ. The bells of the Wester tower and tourists. The Vondelpark and markets salesmen. F.C. Ajax football supporters and the harbor control.

Its probably the best sounding Grand Piano Ive ever played (I have played a Steinway Model D in college which is also incredible but I think i prefer the Fazioli), with a beautiful, clear 'pearly'  sound with great clarity throughout the whole range of the instrument. Obviously the Nord XL sample of the Fazioli does a good job but in reality, hearing and playing the actual instrument itself brings a whole level of detail to the sound and keyboard action and response that you cannot replicate!Here is a video of me playing the Piano with my Jazz trio:We play the great Tommy Flanagan calypso tune, ""Eclypso"" from the seminal hard-bop album ""The Cats"" recorded in 1957 (another great year for Jazz) originally featuring John Coltrane. One of my favourite versions of the tune is from Flanagan's vibey ""Overseas"" Piano trio album from the same year. It also features some fantastic drum and brush work from Elvin Jones.The mic pre that was used was a Forssell smp-2, not sure what the mics were.Comments and Critiques welcome",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=85524&sid=94f4a6d600304a9e02524c42b83ab672#p85524

He engages in research as a ‘sound architect’. Kuit constructed between 2010 and 2017 virtual electronic systems where spectral chaos was converted to serial sound constellations.

As you can see I have a Yamaha FC5 for sustain and a Roland EV5 for volume for each keyboard.  The pedalboards are from Temple Audio.  The wider one is a Solo 18 at full length and the other is a Solo 18 cut down to 10"" (Temple will cut them down to whatever width you want at no extra charge).  There are adhesive mounting plates on back of the pedals to secure them to them board.  And they can handle some pretty good abuse.  Temple makes a module that mounts on the side of the frame that has four 1/4"" thru jacks.  They work with both TS and TRS.  Then I had snakes made from ProAudioLA to go from pedalboard to keyboards.  As you can see it looks pretty clean and everything is completely wired in the photo (pedals, MIDI in/out, and stereo audio).  No dangling cords or cables.  I'll take a picture of the underneath and side of the pedalboard so you can get a better idea.mikep",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=84871&sid=67884e1909c8cb41dacd6203b30b85e8#p84871

The primary source video for 90% of the visuals is from the overhead view of the live studio session. The only other footage is a video field recording from Chicago's Union Station also recorded on the Zoom Q4N. The audio was not edited when I added video effects in post.The audio field recording was extracted the Zoom Q4N video shot at Union Station. It's mangled pretty heavily in this piece put if you listen closely, you can hear an automated voice informing you that you are at track 8 and 10. Interestingly, the speakers at the station are not directional and the audio is at different loop lengths - so just wandering about between these gates is a trippy polyrhythmic treat.Instrumentation and Instrumentalities:The piece is a combination of live sequencing and live performance. The Octatrack is used to host drum samples and recording. It is also used to MIDI sequence 3 synth slots on the Nord Lead 4 including MIDI automation. I perform live using all 4 slots on the Nord plus manipulate the Octatrack in real-time. Lots of real-time sound design and morphing. All the groovy synth sounds are exclusive to Nord Lead 4 all being created in real-time (meaning no synth audio was pre-recorded).",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=86174&sid=67884e1909c8cb41dacd6203b30b85e8#p86174

Weddings and some corporate gigs are notoriously long days, typically they want you there in the afternoon before people arrive and you're not getting out until after everyone's left - so you are really talking about a 12 hour shift.  So I look to charge more towards £200 or more per person for these as this equates to £16 per hour per person which I think is more than reasonable.A DJ would look for at least £500 for a wedding.  When you look at it that way, you get more bang for your buck with a live 6-piece band at £1200.  Another thing is be careful about under charging - Most people planning a wedding set themselves a budget of around £2000 for a live band (corporates expect to pay more around £3000 - £5000 as a minimum).  Going in at £800 is giving the impression you are not the quality of band they are looking for - sure if you really are an £800 band then you will get some wedding work but no corporate work to speak of.I'll be honest, I've seen a lot of pub bands do functions and some are really not up to the task - not the right gear, not good enough players, can't read and adapt to the crowd or simply too much pissing about.  The difficult thing is being absolutely honest with yourselves and deciding whether you really can put on a full show rather than knock out a few covers.The best corporate stuff I do is for a pharmaceutical company.  We get £450 each plus all expenses paid - flights, hotels, gear rider, meals, after show drinks.  We work with an events management company who provide a complete stage crew.

He advocated a kind of music that consisted of single-layered, 'single-colour' electric sounds.Furthermore, Cahier-M devotes ample attention to the morphological relationship between the typically uniform nature of electric sound and the multi-layered sound structures used by post-WWII serial composers. The discussion of this subject also covers layering (photo) graphic images as practised by the French physiologist E.J. Marey at the end of the 19th century, flipping monadic sound aggregates as practised by Karel Goeyvaerts since 1952, the application of so-called 'horizontal arpeggios' by Pierre Boulez around 1980, and the introduction of 'liquid forms' in contemporary architecture.These aspects are illustrated based on a still valid morphological analysis of sound conducted by the author between 1963 and 1967.http://books.google.nl/books/about/Cahi ... edir_esc=yRoland Kuit - Mondriaanhuishttps://www.artifex.nu/agenda/2198/2964 ... nhuis.htmlmonads and beyond concertThe painter Piet Mondriaan (1872-1944) who, based from his ideas about so called neo-plasticism, started to build a connection with music on the one hand.""Et quant au moyen de production du son, il sera préférable d'employer l'électricité, le magnétisme, la mécanique, car ils excluent mieux l'immixtion de l'individuel."" This is what Piet Mondriaan said in his essay Le Néo-Plasticism (De Nieuwe Beelding) which was published as a brochure in late 1920 by the L'Effort Moderne in Paris. This essay was dedicated to the 'hommes futurs' — future mankind. In this essay, Mondriaan, based on an analogy with a new plastic art (painting), tries to define a new kind of music the sounds of which should ideally be produced by electric, magnetic, and mechanic (i.e. automatic) devices to avoid undesirable alterations based on individual, subjective and interpretational preference.Mondriaan advocates a kind of music deprived of any kind of personal feelings, depth, warmth, and empathy and whose sound no longer presents the 'roundness', 'swells', 'reverberation', or other typically instrumental characteristics of a romantic idiom. The sounds should rely on a few basic tones and not be structured harmonically but rather as unbreakable units. They should be experienced as coups' — pulses. No melody, but quick sequences of primary- tones and so-called non-tones. Mondriaan imagines tone fields that are enclosed by three tones: a 'red' one, a 'yellow' one, and a 'blue' one. Based on a concept of confrontation, these fields are counterbalanced by non-tonal fields whose corners are based on a-chromatic, atonal, noises, 'black', 'grey', and 'white'. These six tones have an immediate attack and no release. Together, they constitute compositions of contrasting 'coups' (hits) whose rhythm is open and free. Mondrian believes chat these tones or sounds need to be generated by electric devices or newly developed musical instruments; it is of prime importance, however, that they be 'fixed' unequivocally in a yet unknown way. In his text about Neo-Plasticism, he therefore talks about soulless things, such as 'l'électricité and ""magnetisme' of which he later(in late 1921) said that they were ideally suited for generating tones whose 'wavelength and oscillation' remain constant for their entire duration. He also demands that those new musical instruments, whether or not they are fitted with 'électricité' and 'magnétisme', be capable of instantly switching off a tone, without 'reverberating noises' or the like. These are precisely the criteria that can be met a lot better by electric sounds than instrumental sounds. Electric tones indeed have no body, they do not linger on, and they go off in the same way as when you switch off a light bulb.

Part 2: The Poetry of Sound.In times of great changes this work of sound art as a tribute to the experimental poetry.In 1920, Theo van Doesburg, Piet Mondrian and Antony Kok formulated their ideas in the style in a manifesto about the literature: the naturalistic clichés which provided by the produced dramatic word movies and books, per meter and per pound, contain nothing of the new rules of their lives. Those new rules they would create themselves.Kurt Schwitters Ursonate makes a perfect example against war, nationalism, protectionism, racism and establishment. The reason I use his sound poetry is to transform my fears to beauty. My fear is that progress has come to an end. What rest is degradation. So how to create art on ruins of society?I will create even more disturbing art. By creating a peregrination through the human soul, finding new values in an impellent quadraphonic terrain of vocal spectra.We can consider the speech of man as a train of monoliths, vertical sounds as spectral accumulations of sine tones. Roland Kuit created spectral tilts by technical means and these data traversing into a three-dimensional fields. As various forms of movement - migration. This can be random, or, take place according to algorithmic structures.World premiered at Festival Internacional de Música Experimental en Vallecas, Sonikas XIV, Madrid 2016Roland Kuit: KymaKarin Schomaker: VisualsFor the Concertzender Roland made a selection from this 24 parts work.

I have tested it thoroughly at home but tomorrow night will be my first gig using SLM. The tablet is held by a Hercules DG320B arm which attaches to my standard double braced X stand. Connection from tablet to NS2 is standard OTG (On The Go) cable then Roland UM-One MIDI interface.I have a sustain pedal and volume pedal for each keyboard (yep, 4 in total!) but the volume pedal for the FA06 is connected in-line to the stereo outs, not the control pedal input. I also play guitar (I play a Rickenbacker 330 or Yamaha RGX620DZ - both crackers!) and have this going into a volume pedal, then into a Behringer V-Amp floor unit, straight into the band's main desk, from which I get a feed into my Mackie Thump 12 monitor.Keyboards are set up so that SLM sends program change messages only to the NS2. The NS2 programs are set up using the Extern sections to send program change messages to the FA06. For the few songs which just use FA06 sounds, I have programs which have all the NS2 internal sections turned off. SLM also sends some Control Change messages to change things like drawbars, leslie, FX, levels, etc.Tomorrow will be the acid test, ie in a full gig situation, but I am confident it will be good - I will update here on sunday!.

The battery is pretty good on the tablet, but I made sure it was fully charged before I went to the gig, kept a close eye on it, and had the charger with me just in case I needed to charge up between sets. I didn't switch it off when not in use but turned the display off. But it only went down to about 40% so very happy with that. I think it is possible to modify an OTG cable to enable charging at the same time, but not something I would want to risk. If at some point the tablet battery is so bad that this doesn't work I would just get another tablet.

This quantum representation formed the famous Gabor matrix. Like a sonogram, the vertical dimension of the Gabor matrix indicated the location of the frequency energy, while the horizontal dimension indicated the time region in which this energy occurred. In a related project, Gabor built a machine to granulate sound into particles. This machine couldalter the duration of a sound without shifting its pitch.In these two projects, the matrix and the granulator, Gabor accounted for both important domains of sound representation. The matrix was the original windowed frequency-domain representation. ""Windowed'' means segmented in time, and ""frequency-domain'' refers to spectrum. The granulation machine, on the other hand, operated on a time-domain representation, which is familiar to anyone who has seen waveforms in a sound editor.Curtis Roads is the first person to implement granular sound processing in the digital domain.Curtis Roads creates, teaches, and pursues research in the interdisciplinary territory spanning music and sound technology. He studied electronic music and computer music composition at California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) and the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) and received a Doctorate from the Université Paris 8.He was Editor and Associate Editor of Computer Music Journal (The MIT Press) from 1978 to 2000, and co-founded the International Computer Music Association (ICMA) in 1979.A researcher in computer music at MIT (1980-1986), he also worked in the software industry for a decade. He taught electronic music composition at Harvard University and sound synthesis techniques at the University of Naples. He was appointed Director of Pedagogy at Les Ateliers UPIC (later CCMIX) and Lecturer in the Music Department of the Université Paris 8.A pioneer in the development of granular synthesis (1974), he also developed (with Alberto de Campo) the program PulsarGenerator (2001), distributed by the Center for Research in Electronic Art Technology (CREATE) at UCSB. Another invention is the Creatovox, an expressive instrument for virtuoso performance that is based on the synthesis of sound grains and other sound particles. The Creatovox, developed in collaboration with Alberto de Campo, was first demonstrated to the public in March 2000. In 2008, CREATE released Emission Control, a new program for sound granulation written by David Thall in consultation with Curtis Roads.“Beneath the level of the note lies the realm of microsound, of sound particles.Microsonic particles remained invisible for centuries. Recent technological advances let us probe and explore the beauties of this formerly unseen world.Microsonic techniques dissolve the rigid bricks of music architecture the notes into a more fluid and supple medium. Sounds may coalesce, evaporate, or mutate into other sounds.The sensations of point, pulse (regular series of points), line (tone), and surface (texture) appear as the density of particles increases. Sparse emissions leave rhythmic traces. When the particles line up in rapid succession, they induce the illusion of tone continuity that we call pitch. As the particles meander, they row into streams and rivulets. Dense agglomerations of particles form swirling sound clouds whose shapes evolve over time.”(Curtis Roads “Microsounds” 2001)Xenakis applied the first microsounds in composition electronic music.Not realtime but by use of tape splicing, tape speeds, numerous transitions and overdubs, these -cut into one-second fragments of burning charcoal- sounds getting a granular character.01/ Xenakis: Concrete PH (1958). *Barry Truax managed to create granular synthesis in real time using the PODX system, at the Simon Fraser University.02/ Barry Truax: The blind man(1979). excerpt **Curtis Roads ***:03/         Now (2003). 6:14.04/         Eleventh Vortex (2001). 4:06.05/         Half-life, Part I: Sonal Atoms (1999). 3:34.06/         Half-life, Part II: Granules (1999). 2:44.07/         Sculptor (2001). 3:13.08/         Volt Air, Part I (2003). 3:16.09/         Volt Air, Part II (2003). 2:35.10/         Volt Air, Part III (2003). 2:15.11/         Volt Air, Part IV (2003). 2:07.12/         Fluxon (2003). 3:05.13/         Pictor Alpha (2003). 3:23.14/         Nanomorphosis (2003). 3:16.* REGRM 007 / Iannis XenakisGRM Works 1957-1962.**Barry Truax‎– Digital SoundscapesLabel:Cambridge Street Records ‎– CSR-CD 8701.***CD13           Tenth Vortex (2000). 3:01.DVD01         Sculptor (2001). 3:12.DVD02         Half-life (1999) Parts I And II. 7:36.DVD03         Volt Air, Part I (2003). 3:14.DVD04         Volt Air, Part II (2003). 2:34.DVD05         Volt Air, Part III (2003). 3:19.DVD06         Volt Air, Part IV (2003). 2:01.DVD07         Fluxon (2003). 3:09.DVD08         Pictor Alpha (2003). 3:25.DVD09         Nanomorphosis (2003). 3:15.DVD10         Sonal Atoms Visualization By Woon Seung Yeo. 3:36.DVD11         Pictor Alpha Visualization By Garry Kling. 3:26.DVD12         Audio Lecture By Curtis Roads At Stanford University June 2004. 20:57.DVD13         Historical Example Of Granular Synthesis: Prototype (1975). 6:42.Curtis Roads – Point Line Cloud.Label: Asphodel – ASP 3000Produced by: Roland Kuithttp://www.concertzender.nl/programmagi ... tail=84932",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=72596&sid=67884e1909c8cb41dacd6203b30b85e8#p72596

Educated in Buenos Aires he studied harmony, counterpoint and composition with Daniel Montes and Francisco Kropfl. He was an active member of Otras Musicas Group and FARME of Buenos Aires. He composed his first electroacoustic piece Mirada Roja in 1993, specializing in composition techniques in electroacoustics. He has received-among many awards - a special mention of the Municipality of Buenos Aires, first prize of the FNA, and honorable residence in the International Electroacoustic Music Competition at Bourges. His compositions, including works for instrumental, digital and mixed media, electronic music, acousmatic art, visual poetry, music theater and performances. Frequently explores the spacialisation of sound in composition mixing electroacoustic sounds, vocal sounds and acoustical instruments.Since 2014 is member of Sonoridades Alternativas of Buenos Aires.Gustavo Chab – electroacoustic music:1/ Mirada Roja. (“red sight”, first piece 1992). Electronic Music, is a homonym of an expressionist painting by Arnold Schönberg (1910).This piece tries to convey the expressive power of the picture. The imaginary voice emerges from the center of the picture, evoking transformation as an emotive symbol. At the same time, the sight stands out from its dramatic environment. Here, the yearning for change is also an illusion poetically expressed. The material is given a meaning and a temporal reference, having as a starting point the aesthetic value that the author elaborates in relation to a time and work. The material acts and dilutes itself, and throughout the three sections of the piece it modulates from an electronic voice simulation towards a real chorus. This work was completed at LIPM, using a DX7 and a Synclavier II.2/ Dedálico 2007 -2008. Another common Dalíesque image emerge slowly. Dalí's theory of ""softness"" and ""hardness"", which was central to his thinking at the time.

Certain types of pulsars rival atomic clocks in their accuracy in keeping time. the light is pointed in the direction of an observer, and is responsible for the pulsed appearance of emission. They have regular rotational periods. This produces a very precise interval between pulses that range from roughly milliseconds to seconds for an individual pulsar.

His electroacoustic music compositions have been performed widely throughout the United States, Europe, Asia, and Latin America. He has been honored with numerous awards including fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Fulbright Commission. He is the recipient of Luigi Russolo and Bourges Prizes (including the Euphonies d’Or prize) and recently was recognized as the recipient of the International Computer Music Association’s 2012 Americas Regional Award. In addition to his electro-acoustic works, Nelson has composed a variety of acoustic compositions that have been performed by ensembles such as the New World Symphony, the Memphis Symphony, the Brazos Valley Symphony Orchestra, ALEA III, and others. He has composed in residence at Sweden’s national Electronic Music Studios, the Visby International Composers Center and at IMEB in Bourges, France. His works can be heard on the Bourges, Russolo Pratella, Innova, CDCM, NEUMA, ICMC, and SEAMUS labels. He is currently a Professor at the University of North Texas College of Music.1/  the rain has a slap and a curve—1997, for stereo tape, 8:24″For computer-generated tape is based upon excerpts from Robert Gregory’s poem rain, convenience store, hungry cats. The majority of the sonic material is derived from a recording of the poet reading the following three lines of the poem: the rain has a slap and a curve the path it falls on curves also even after the rain you can hear a whisper of rain The composition is divided into three main sections that explore the sonic possibilities of the source material.(1)2/  Scatter—2000, for 8-channel tape, 8:48″Commissioned by the 20th Annual New Music and Art Festival at Bowling Green State University. This multi-channel work for tape is based on recordings of sounds that contain an element of motion. The composition explores the use of sound spatialization as a primary formal determinant. Scatter attempts to surround the listener with events fromevery direction that move at varying velocities. The work also explores the composers own multi-channel implementation of granular synthesis that “scatters” sonic grains throughout the multi-channel environment.(2)3/  l’Horloge imaginaire—2002, for 8-channel tape, 10:30″an 8-channel tape fantasy based upon clock sounds. The source recordings for this work emanate from a wide variety of clocks including the medieval astrological clock in La cathédral St-Etienne in Bourges, musical clocks of the 19th century, church bells, and clocks of the present day. Exhibiting both ethereal and percussive sonic landscapes, this work presents my interpretation of the sounds we associate with the passage of time. This work was commissioned by the Institut International de Musique Electroacoustique de Bourges (IMEB) and was realized in their studios in Bourges, France.(3)4/  objet sonore/objet cinétique—2007, for stereo tape, 11:37″A composition that explores the kinesis/stasis continuum as it relates to sound objects and musical motion. This work exhibits a variety of possible temporal manifestations of sound, navigating the boundaries between motion and rest to create gestures of animation and repose that shape musical structure. I am most grateful to the Institut International de Musique Electroacoustique de Bourges (IMEB) for commissioning this composition and generously providing the utilization of their studios in Bourges, France for the production of this work. objet sonore/objet cinétique was recently awarded second prize in the CIMESP 2007 international computer music competition.(4)5/  Turbulent Blue—2009, for stereo tape, 9:25″A certain degree of turbulence is required to initiate any sound, whether this impetus is a whorl of air, a gush of fluid, a surge of friction, or a sudden impact. As a musical instrument responds to this unstable flow, its physical properties provide feedback that reigns in the chaos, stabilizing the sound into a more periodic tone. Using both sampled materials and physical models of sound, this composition strives to create a surreal sonic world in which the real and imaginary coexist. This work was commissioned by the Institut International de Musique Electroacoustique de Bourges (IMEB) and was realized in their studios in Bourges, France. Initial research for the composition was also made possible through a University of North Texas Research and Creativity Enhancement grant.(5)6/  Illusory Lines—2015, 8-channel fixed media, 10:48″ (excerpt)An immersive 8-channel composition that utilizes several significant aural illusions to provide the work’s structural underpinnings. Specifically, the work incorporates both Shepard Tones (endless glissandi) and Risset Rhythms (endless accelerando/ritardando) that are featured prominently in several large sections of the work. The surface of the composition includes physically modeled strings and meshes/plates as well as samples from an accordion, a double bass and bees, exploring the inter-relationships between these seemingly divergent synthetic and concrete sound worlds. Spatialization strategies highlight a variety of structural moments while creating a rich sense of location within space.(6)(1)recording released in November 1998 on the Centaur label’s Consortium for the Distribution of Computer Music (CDCM) CD Series, Volume 27, “CEMIsonics: The Threshold of Sound,” CRC 2407.(2)recording released in October 2001 on the American Composers Forum “Sonic Circuits IX” compact disc (Innova 118).(3)released in 2005 on the Society for Electro-Acoustic Music in the United States “Music from SEAMUS 14” compact disc (EAM 2004).(4)released in 2010 on the Society for Electro-Acoustic Music in the United States “Music from SEAMUS 19” compact disc.(5)released in 2015 on the APEM/CIME (Archiving and Preservation of Electroacoustic Music/Confédération Internationale de Musique Electroacoustique) label for the Miso Music Portugal 2015 Festival CD.(6) Not yet on CD.Produced by: Roland Kuit",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=74933&sid=67884e1909c8cb41dacd6203b30b85e8#p74933

I took a C2 (painted black with Wurly legs), and link it up via midi to a Electro 3 ""module"".  I took the keys off of the Electro and cut the main control panel and jacks off of the rest of the metal chassis, then built a new ""desktop"" housing for it.  It's the long white box with wood sides.  The nice thing about having the C2 and Electro 3 linked up, is I can assign the Electro to the top manual, and be able to play The C2 organ on the bottom keyboard at the same time. One can even keep a few drawbars out on the top and blend the two together...  I built a pedal board for the swell pedal, leslie foot switch, piano/organ sustain pedal and a Boss RC-20 XL looper which sit under the C2. The other non-Nord gear seen is a Memotron (wood to match) which triggers the Moog Slim Phatty (wood to match), both go through the Boss Space Echo and then to the looper.  Everything then goes into a Fender Deluxe Reverb, which has great vibrato and reverb for the Electro's Wurly and Rhodes.It's been a long road to built and set this all up, not to mention expensive....But I couldn't be happier.

I'll see if I can post a picture of the leg flanges in the next little bit.  I pulled the side panels off first and made sure nothing was in the way, or at risk of getting nicked by the drill bit.  It does get a bit close to the key bed in the front.  Getting the locking nuts and washers on was tricky at time due to the tight space...One thing I will say, is that the overall stability has been greatly reduced compared to the ""On Stage"" platform stand I once used.  Cosmetically the C2 looks killer on stage as a nondescript black keyboard with 'vintage' chrome legs.  But she wobbles a bit.  The metal chassis it has isn't all that thick and seems to flex a bit.  So my thoughts regarding using Fender Rhodes legs is that I would think they would be even more wobbly.  If you like the thinner look, try modifying the Nord screw-in legs for the Stage/Electro.Good luck and enjoy your new Nord!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=45251&sid=67884e1909c8cb41dacd6203b30b85e8#p45251

This is going to be a really long and probably awfully worded post so I don’t blame any of you if you don’t get further than the first paragraph. Many thanks in advance though!My main gig is with a touring circus show called Circus of Horrors (yes, I ‘ran away with the circus’, no, I’m not a lion tamer). Super fun gig to play, half as much a glam metal gig as it is a circus show. For the last four years my rig hasn’t changed - Nord Stage EX88 and a Nord Wave, both connected via MIDI. Stage sends the patch changes and also occasionally each keyboard controls each other (e.g. if I want B3 on the top keyboard or Wave samples on the bottom keyboard). It works pretty great, but I want a little more flexibility, as well as smaller keyboards.So here’s my current idea:I’d like to keep the Nord organs and electric pianos as I’m yet to find any that I love more, even on soft synths. For that reason I’m thinking perhaps a 61 key Nord Electro. As well as that I’d like a 49/61 key MIDI controller on top.I’d then like to set up a rack. In the rack I’d like a Macbook Pro most likely running MainStage (gonna grab me a new 2016 one pretty soon). It’ll stay closed in the rack and I’ll probably mirror the screen to an iPad - I’m on top of a bandstand so it’d be nice if I could leave the rack on the stage so I don’t have to lift too much stuff up there. I’ll also have an interface in there, and a wireless system for my in ears.At the moment I send both of my keys into a mixer and send one stereo signal to FOH. I have another mixer which I send the same signal to, as well as taking a mono signal for my monitor feed. That way I get a stereo mix of my keys and can independently control the level of that alongside the rest of the band. What I’d now like to do is route all the audio through the Macbook/interface. I’ll send the Nord’s audio into the Macbook, then control the level of the Nord in each patch in MainStage (I’d also like to use the Nord as a controller). I’ll then send a stereo mix from the Macbook to FOH. I’ll also have a stereo monitor signal either going directly into the IEM unit or via the Macbook.So my shopping list is this:Keyboards:- MIDI Controller (recommendations? Something that works well with MainStage preferably.. a few knobs and sliders and some pads too)- Nord Electro 5D 61Rack:- Audio Interface (I’m not too good with this sorta thing so I’m still not entirely sure what I’d need.. ideally don’t really want to spend more than £200 on this)- Wireless system for IEMs (recommendations?)- Wifi router to mirror Macbook screen to iPadAny suggestions for the above are much appreciated and likewise I’m open to ideas for slightly different setups that would achieve a similar result.Cheers!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=79097&sid=67884e1909c8cb41dacd6203b30b85e8#p79097

While myself I have the COMPACT with Waterfall keys, I am thinking of getting a 76 or 88 for as an additional home keyboard if the action makes it worth the 3000 bucks.And the Fantom Rack, never thought of using i with the Stage together?? JOf course I thought about using the Fantom XR with my Stage, but I needed the money! ;o)I used the Fantom as sampler to play back my piano samples. The Kurzweil piano sounds good and works well in the mix but it lacks the dirty upright character I need. I used the Rain Piano samples from Sampletekk with my Fantom. I programmed the patch and mapped the samples myself - took me forever. It sounded really great. But it took the Fantom over 10 minutes to load the samples each power-up. Thats not handy in a live situation.I also needed a decent Wurlitzer. I had the precisionsound samples in the Fantom which increased the loading time further.But then I got to play the Nord Stage in my local Music Store and realized that they put the Rain Piano in there!! The Wurly sounded great too! So I bought the NS and I don't regret it!The Kurzweil action is OK. It is lighter than the Stage action. It is made by Fatar - TP-10. It's the same that Doepfer uses in their masterkeyboards. The NS 88 and 76 have the Fatar TP-40, I think. But this thing was heavy and I wanted a small, light keyboard to carry around. The only things I miss from the Kurz are the strings and the pipe organs. But I don't need them very often. Since I don't really like ANY of the plastic ""hammer action"" keys in today's (and past) keyboards - including the NS - I decided to buy the Compact. I really think it's not so bad playing piano on the waterfall keyboard (you need to get used to it, of course) and its lighter AND I am building a masterkeyboard with a real piano action anyway, but it'll take some time to get it finished.

But proyect got cancelled and I got into a hard part of school (can only practice once a week).I personally think the M3-M is better than the Motif (only thing better on Motif for me is pianos and stuff... but got the Stage), and the only thing better on the fantom G for me is the patch hold. Plus the M3 has a better interface in my opinion.About your question, I believe the M3-M is really capable of composing full songs. The Triton could, so why not its successor?     The M3-M has got some great drums and its got some sequences already in it, plus with Karma, it could be very fun just to put a karma track and play to it. I have tried it out several times in stores, and I gotta tell that is an impressive sound engine. Many of the bread and butter sounds are quite great in presets, imagine what you could program ;).My suggestion: go and try it out. It is definitely one of the best things that compliments the Nord Stage, what the NS lacks, the M3-M has, and vice versa (including keybed lol). It could be specially useful to a solo artist, since it would provide you with the necesary support to play like a full band live, but perhaps just turn those guitar solos into cool organ or synth solos ;)Another sugestion I believe is quite good is that if you do not seek sequencing nor drum tracks, but some of the bread and butter sounds, a Waldorf Blofeld is a great companion too. And it is quite cheap new.Of course all of the before mentioned is when talking of current gen stuff that you can get brand new. Still, I have looked into many posible configurations for the ultimate 2 ""keyboard"" set up and this is the one I like the most so far: a two tier stand, in the lower stand, the NS88 (at the most comfortable height, the height it would be at in a single tier stand), in the higher stand, about 10 cm above the NS and titled forward, the M3-M (chose this in great deal because of the interface it has, simply one of the best).  Since the M3M supports sampling, if you ever have a sound you cant recreate either in the NS or the M3, you could always sample it ;).My setup would also include the NS sending note information to the M3, but also having the M3 tell the stage when to change programs (I believe in teh M3 you can change programs with a footstep switch). Talking about foot stuff, I´d also keep it simple: connected to the NS: an organ swell pedal, a sustain and a control pedal (both´s data is  sent to the M3-m through midi.) and to the M3 only the footswitch for changing programs is used. Another thing in which the M3 helps is effects: the M3 has two inputs, so you can always have in the Nord Stage a stereo pair that is processed by the M3, this may also help avoid needing a mixer just for your keyoboards. Because if you only use one stereo out on the Nord Stage and want everything or nothing to be processed by the M3, then only the M3´s out signals woud go into the main mixer. But to use the set up in full advantage, I would have the first stereo pair of outs, to always be what I want un processed, and outs 3 and 4 to be porcessed by the M3, and in each out can be a different mono sound. And if I am right, since eachout would be a mono sound, each one could be processed independently of the other.If any one around here is interested in more M3 reviews, check this one outhttp://acapella.harmony-central.com/for ... ?t=1961837I also recommend looking for reviews in the Keyboard Magazine or such. Also dont miss the sound on sound review.GustavoPS: if you dont need karma and dont mind not having sampling, the M50 is a great budget option, although it only comes in keyboard versions, but the M50 61 is roughly 1k US dollars. It still does the sampling, but has a limited interface.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=225&sid=67884e1909c8cb41dacd6203b30b85e8#p225

(this is for anyone in general and also applies to using effects, drawbars, etc...)It is kind of like truly playing good. sure many players will be able to memorize a whole song, but really good players are able to hear a short song and play it right away (well even if they dont play it very good)Gus",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=270&sid=67884e1909c8cb41dacd6203b30b85e8#p270

I also use some of the EXS software instruments, especially for sampled Strings and some additional mellotron sounds (that's where the Nord Stage 2 would come in handy :) and some Bell-like sounds from Sculpture (which is one of my favourite synths in the Logic suite).@Petrounic: Yes, you can use ProFire stand-alone, but just with a fixed routing, which I didn't find very useful. In Stand-Alone, input channels 1-2 are sent to output 1-2 and input 3-4 is sent to output 3-4, IIRC. Unfortunately it doesn't save your routing setup for offline use. So if you want any other routings, you need to connect it to a laptop while using it.@Johannes: Thanks for the compliments! Yes, we don't like guitars very much, so we try to get most out of the keyboard sounds. I found the clavinets very very useful for doing some more rythmic patterns which are usually played by a rythm guitar. The Wah-Wah is especially great for this purpose, combined with a volume pedal :) I actually played around with a lot of different setups, with a dedicated synth/sampler instruments, much more effects etc. But it always ended up in a mess, mainly because using these kinds of sounds in a live situation requires a lot of preparation. So you have to put a big effort in preparing effects, sound changes etc., but end up pressing just some preset buttons during performance. So the Nord gave me the chance to actually perform and play naturally with the sounds live, which is just the way I feel most comfortable (as is true for the rest of our band). That is ultimately how we ended up with this kind of sound and ambience.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=2730&sid=67884e1909c8cb41dacd6203b30b85e8#p2730

In the live picture below, on the left I was playing an Hammond XK3C.  This was stolen the next day after the picture was taken.  It was stolen along with $14000 in band gear out of our trailer, and guess what?  We started a two week studio session that same day.  With the help of friends, we borrowed, rented and bought what we had to.  I rented a Korg CX3, and ran it through my Leslie 860.  It worked out ok...  I had to sell the Little Phatty in order to put money down on a Nord C2 and Slim Phatty, both financed together.  It took a bit of getting used to, but I love the new set up.  I control the Slim Phatty with the Memotron, both outputs go into the Roland Space Echo.  All boards go into a Fender Deluxe Reverb, the Nord, Moog, Tron are sent to the clean channel, and the Rhodes into the reverb/vibrato channel.  The Nord also gets connected to a Leslie 860 via 11 pin cable.  The on-board controls operate the Leslie speeds, which means no combo stomp box...  The blend between the Deluxe and the Leslie is incredible!  As a former XK1 and XK3C owner, I can say with total certainty that the Nord C2 is the BEST digital Hammond clone out there!!!

I put my most used one on the bottom, my NS2. Then I put the Korg M50 green and on thop the Pro 2 so I can edit it while standing and the panel is not obstructed. All of these are wired in Stereo to my Zoom UAC-8. They also receive MIDI from the Zoom using a MIDI Solutions Quad Thru that is taped underneath the Korg M50. This way, I can sequence and record each of them with REAPER.All other keyboards are not connected. That is because I only have 2 channels left in my audio interface. I put the mini keyboards on top, they are a MicroKorg XL+ (great for vocoder and pads) and a Yamaha Reface CP, which I mostly use with bateries and its internal speaker to mess around. I truly recommend the CP, it sounds amazing for the size and price.On a music stand, I have my Kaossilator Pro and my Volcas. Lately though, I have only been using the Volca Sample for drums. All the Volcas have batteries and mostly use them to mess around.And last but definitely not least, my most recent acquisition: a Moog Minimoog Voyager Lunar White Special Edition on a Hercules X Stand. I have just started to experiment and get to know this one. Unfortunately, the envelope generators have a fault and the Decay does not work, so they are working like ASR instead of ADSR. Still, physically it's almost like new, but I hope Moog eventually responds my questions and helps me fix this.For amplification I am using my trusty EV ELXP 112-P and on my computer (which is on the opposite side of the Moog) I use my Event Alp 5, although I might change these since they are starting to show some wear on the woofers.Almost all my cables are Hosa, they have been great and they are not very expensive. My Nord though, is using Mogami gold cables. IMHO the difference is in build quality, but not in sound.So there you go!

A couple of months ago I was contacted by a recording studio owned by a Pink Floyd enthusiast. He stumbled upon some of my covers on SoundCloud and offered to lead a cover project with me and other musicians. The project consists of covering the whole The Wall original album to the last note, including voice, sound and TV shows FX and including acoustic recordings of real symphonic and harmonic orchestras (no VSTs). The  point is not to achieve an incredible performance since the original will always remain better (although we will try our best) but rather to tell the story of the project making as we proceed further, because we already know it will be a rewarding experience. We will upload bits of sound and video recordings at each new step. We already have several musician participants (drums, piano...) but we also need fresh ones.We started by recording a quick model of Nobody Home (made in my living room in 1/2 day and mixed in another 1/2 day) which you can listen here:Do not pay to much attention at the result since we used an upright piano instead of a grand, a lousy dynamic mic for the voice and awful VSTs for winds and strings.Last week we recorded most of the drums (everything except the very last tracks of disc 2 actually). Here is a raw take of the drums on Comfortably Numb (no sound processing).The video of the drums recording session will be uploaded shortly. We would like your opinions on our project, maybe collaboration propositions if you feel like it, and will be happy to answer any questions you may have.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=68360&sid=81deb757851b2f354a56e463fad49cf1#p68360

I'd like your suggestions.At the moment we're leaning towards the Scarlett focusrite 18i20, Scarlett Octopre Mk II, or the MOTU 8-pre but are having some difficulty making up our minds.Any suggestions?Thanks in advance!Dugrok",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=67272&sid=81deb757851b2f354a56e463fad49cf1#p67272

You mentioned that your band has this lineup: (5 piece: 2 guitars, bass, keyboard and drums + 3 vocals).  If recording the entire band all at the same time, I would guess you would need a minimum of 3 lines for the drum kit (2 condenser overheads plus the kick), 1 for each of the 2 guitars, bass, and keyboard, plus 3 for the vocals.  That would be 3+4+3=10 lines.  Even if you reduced it to just 1 instead of 2 overhead mics for the drum kit, you would still need 9 lines, if you were wanting to record the whole band at once.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=67342&sid=81deb757851b2f354a56e463fad49cf1#p67342

Ultimately, it's a matter of how many instruments you'll be recording SIMULTANEOUSLY that matters. You just need to decide exactly how you're going to do your recordings, and do the arithmetic about how many mic preamp and line level inputs you need. If you're intending to record your instruments mostly separately, that will reduce your need for mic preamps quite considerably.Basically:Drums - Recorded acoustically with mics. One mic preamp for each mic on the drum kitBass - Either mic up the speaker or DI the bass, one mic preamp needed. (You can do both simultaneously if you want. Some people do that to get the best possible bass sound, but it's not absolutely necessary).Guitar - Usually mic up the speaker cab. Not usually DI'ed, but some guitarists do use amps or effects that can be DI'ed or have line level outputs.Keyboards - You should know this one! Out the back to line level inputs.Vocals - mics.  'nuff said.If you can reduce your need for mic preamps to four, you can save a ton of money on your interface. Just thought I'd mention it.Edit:Another factor to consider when deciding how much money you want to spend is whether you're going to use the interface and other gear again in the future. The more use you need to get from your interface, the more it makes sense to spend the extra to get better quality stuff. If you're only really going to use it once for your demos, then spending a lot of money on high quality studio-grade gear doesn't make so much sense. In that case, it only needs to be ""good enough"" to get the job done.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=67547&sid=81deb757851b2f354a56e463fad49cf1#p67547

Yes, all the other instruments are real (I'm very old-skool when it comes to using real instruments). If there is an instrument I want to use and I don't own it or can't play it, then I might use a Nord Mellotron sound, or even my old Casio WK-3000, which has some great orchestral instrument sounds. On one of my songs I even used an iPad autoharp app!I never use keyboard bass, and these days I usually use a Stagg electric upright rather than bass guitar. I'm a much better bass player than I am a guitarist, but I play enough six-string to do what I need to.Here are some other songs. The first three are more comedy country songs by ""Wayne Gutbucket III"":I Just Can't Stand the Way That She Makes Pies(no Nord on this one)Radio W.I.M.P.(Nord Wurly)Don't Buy a Banjo, My Son(Nord upright)The last one is more of a funk number.Genie(Nord Wurly and B3; Casio WK-3000 horn section; drums programmed in HammerHead 1.0 and arranged in Audacity)",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=63540&sid=81deb757851b2f354a56e463fad49cf1#p63540

But I can't sing, so asked around for a singer.

I play bass/kbds and sing backing with an occasional lead.  No computers/traxx needed.  I'm only with that trio every other Sunday afternoon, but we've held that gig for five years now with no complaints.  And the other two guys from the trio work full-time as a duo the rest of the week.  They've worked a steady 4-5 times per week (and often more in season) that way, a drummer/singer and a guitarist, for about 7-8 years, making good money, paying their bills and raising their kids off of nothing but music.I have no doubts that these people in the vid are good people and they obviously have serious musical skills.  I wouldn't have bothered to go out of my way to volunteer my thoughts on this, but they posted the vid and asked for response, so I'm responding with my personal opinion.  They obviously don't need to play on top of canned traxx to sound good.  I'd be much happier to see them play as a duo, or add a third if need be, without leaning on samples stolen/borrowed from the latest pop craze hit.  For me this works better as an audition tape for someone else looking for a drum/bass team, and I won't be surprised to learn that they do hook up with someone who happens to be looking for bass/drum help as a result of this vid.Your points about finding musicians (generally a crazy lot already, and it seems that the level of crazy usually increases with the level of talent) is well taken and I personally am blessed to have found people with whom I have been able to work for a very long time -- but just keep plugging away at what YOU do and seek satisfaction on your own terms and you may discover that the right person/people will come to you.Lastly, I'd encourage you to try singing even if you think you can't.  There are plenty of folks who've done well singing even though they have terrible voices when defined in the classical sense (Joe Cocker, Tom Waits, Rod Stewart, whatshisface from the Stones, oh yeah, Mick Jagger).

But that's going to change!  More piano!).  I have a double stack with an N73 on top and an N76 on the bottom.  My Sweetwater guy set me up with a cool mixer that I put on a boom so it's just above my top board, then I can adjust the master volume of both, just the N76, or just the N73 (three knobs).  Then I'm not fishing for the master volume on the N76 underneath, and I can change the volume of both boards at once.  I also have volume pedals allowing me the same functionality as well.But adjusting live when the songs aren't seared in your brains often affects the quality of my playing.  When I dial in my sounds at home to sound like they're at the same volume so I have less live volume to adjust, I then go play live at practice and certain sounds are still too loud or soft.  It's unnerving to know whether you're volume is correct as I start a fair amount of songs.  What I'm also finding is different timbres get sucked up more so than others.  My trumpet for example, if I set it the same volume as the other sounds, it just gets sucked up and no one hears it.  So that one I always have to jack up higher than the others.  I find that with strings too.  Does anyone else find this?Between the two boards, sometimes I'm splitting up to 2-3 sounds per board.  I've heard from most that it's trial and error.  Tweak at home as best you can, then tweak while you're playing live, then save your adjusted settings.But if anyone has any additional advice that I'm missing or anything that would help make this easier, please advise.Gosh, if bass players knew how good they have it.....",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=59557&sid=81deb757851b2f354a56e463fad49cf1#p59557

Use several viewpoints (home, rehearsal, gig) to build a complete picture. If you have any kind of sequencing/recording in your onstage setup, or have someone else in your band that can noodle on your favourite patches, walk out into the audience during setup/soundcheck and listen to your own rig from that vantage point - that will be a real eye-opener I bet.Having the rest of the band around will change things somewhat too. I find in generally it's never-ending, you're always tweaking, which is multiplied exponentially by the number of different patches / sound sources you are using. Where the Nords are sample-based they really can be completely different from patch to patch.A big learning experience (for me it was anyhow) is figuring out how to blend well with other instruments. It's always a challenge not to trample too much on guitar or bass guitar frequencies while keeping your own patches sounding good, and of course that changes with every musician you encounter. Part of that can be influenced by what notes you play (ie not playing octaves on everything in the left hand all the time if you have a bass player etc)I am really lucky right now as the guitar player I am working with is really keen on chords/voicing etc so we spend a lot of time talking about what we are playing together, to try and compliment each other.

We cover an american band called Clutch, which use/used a lot of organ sounds in their music.Here is a short youtube-video from a gig we played last year -This is very loud and fun rock-music, which for me is very challenging finding the right volume/balance when playing. When I practice at home, everything sounds good, but when playing with the band, I find it very difficult to have exactly the right volume/gain. I use many different customized programs for the different songs, but I find it difficult to have the right set of volume on the different programs. Even if the gain control is at the same level, some are even hard to hear when playing with full band when i turn it at max volume.We usually only play 3-4 gig a year, because of a drummer working in the oil business, traveling a lot abroad, so when playing at smaller pubs/rock scenes, and it always seems hard for the ""sound guy"" to give me the right set of volume out to the audience. I know that my role is to build up the ""soundscape""(?), and to spice it up with a few solos, but sometimes it can be a bit frustrating after a gig when someone tell me that they didnt hear me play because of loud guitar, bass and drums :pAnyone have any tips/experience, or are there any accessories that can help?(English is not my first language, so I am sorry if my descriptions are awkwardly worded)",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=59373&sid=81deb757851b2f354a56e463fad49cf1#p59373

First of all it's important that your monitor mix is right, so that it sounds right to you. Once this is in place, the sound guy can adjust the out volume to match the rest of the band. Make sure your main volume on the keyboard is only about halfway up at this stage. This is all done during sound check.Later on at the gig, I bet the other guys play louder than before, so you should too! So just raise your main volume until it sounds good to you. This should sound good to the audience too!I can also recommend using a volume pedal so that you can easily change your volume while playing.Also, if you know someone in the audience, ask them to give feedback after a few songs.Finally, make a habit of recording your gigs, preferably with video. It's a really good way to get accurate feedback on the performance.Good luck!/Anders",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=59391&sid=81deb757851b2f354a56e463fad49cf1#p59391

(An additional problem is that many sound guys just don't mix keyboards very loud; they often seem to think that the keys aren't as important as the rest of the band).Even if that's not the case, you need enough volume yourself on stage so that you can hear the keys loud enough without your instrument being turned full up - halfway up as elekromin suggested should give you enough ""in hand"" to be able to boost yourself for solos.But if you don't have enough power to hear yourself clearly in the first place, there's nothing you can really do about that.There's also the problem of balancing your different sounds within themselves. As you've found out, what works at home often doesn't work properly with the rest of the band, and adjusting the relative volume of your different sounds is a slow process of trial and error. Even the same sound at the same volume can seem to vary according to the song and arrangement. There are some tricks you can do to help. Try playing in a different register from the guitar player - if he's play a low riff as on your YouTube video, try playing a bit higher (and vice-versa), or adding a little more brightness with some higher drawbars. Adding a bit of overdrive can work wonders - even if the organ sounds a little bit too dirty by itself, the distortion will be obscured in the mix by the guitarist's distortion and it might just give you the extra volume and brightness you need. Unless you're doing the ""Jon Lord"" thing, trying to compete with the guitarist on his own terms won't work - he's got a Marshall! - so you should think in terms of finding the spaces which he isn't using at that moment. Actually, on that video, the organ level is a little bit quiet, but not too bad. It shouldn't take too much to get your volume where it needs to be.And as ever, take great care not to go too far with volume; your hearing is vitally important and you must protect yourself from hearing damage at all costs. If the band are so loud that you can't safely compete with them volume-wise, find another band.Oh, and try standing instead of sitting - it's rock and roll, dude!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=59410&sid=81deb757851b2f354a56e463fad49cf1#p59410

The band was Stratus, formed by Clive Burr shortly after he left Iron Maiden, and was comprised of Clive, Bernie Shaw (now Uriah Heep) on lead vocal, Tino and Cris Troy (Praying Mantis) on guitar and bass, and me.The budget for the album was about 50 pence, and was recorded in Frankfurt at Dreamboat studio, now presumably long gone.These sound like they were recorded from vinyl, and were basically your typical British AOR-style rock from the mid-eighties, an offshoot of NWOBHM.The first track is a breezy up-tempo number, the brass (ahem!) being made up of about a million overdubs on an Oberheim OB8 and my Juno 60, and with a Minimoog solo at the end. I remember having a lot of fun putting the ""brass"" parts together like a jigsaw puzzle, with one of the other guys operating the synth controls - filter, pitchbends and such - while I played.The second track is just your typical cliched AOR ballad, but it features some lovely guitar work by Tino. I used the studio grand (a Steinway I think, but I'm not entirely sure), and an OB8. Quite how we got the piano to sound that bad is a mystery.

I'm eventually looking for a lightweight keyboard with all the versatility and quality of a modern Nord product but with Hammond-style durability that wouldn't object to the occasional violent Keith Emerson homage - the search goes on!And as for female attention...in my experience at least, most people seem to find keyboard solos the equivalent at getting a really high Scrabble score.

I have another one without MIDI that I plan to retrofit and place next to the one pictured.  It sounds remarkably different.That’s a Sequential Circuits Prophet 5 Revision 3.3 with MIDI that I’ve owned for 20 years.  It just came back from Greg Montalbano in Oakland California so it is functioning just like it did in 1981.  Or, more like around 1984 when it was upgraded with MIDI.  It sounds incredible especially through the Ibanez CS9 chorus stomp box.Below the P5 is a Korg M1.  When I lived in Portland Oregon, I purchased this from Dick Peterson, the drummer for the Kingsmen (Louie, Louie).  At the time I had no idea that I was in the presence of greatness, but I collected enough clues from visiting his lavish house and amazing home studio to do some research that revealed that I indeed had a brush with fame.  He never returned further emails asking if he had found the promised owner’s manual.  I don’t think the provenance improves the value of the M1, and I can’t prove it, but it was an interesting deal.  I really hate the sound of the M1.  It’s just awful.  It has a really fresh and solid keyboard action so it makes a decent MIDI controller.In the rack is a Furman power conditioner, a Korg guitar tuner, an Alesis Microverb III, a dbx AFS 224 feedback suppressor, a MOTU midi timepiece, an Oberheim Matrix 1000, and sitting on a rack shelf is an Edirol UA-25EX USB AudioCapture interface.  That’s a Mackie CR 1604 mixer on top of the rack.I have an identical Peavey KB/A 100 just behind the pictured laptop computer for stereo goodness.As far as versatility and overall sound quality, the Nord Lead 3 is my favorite keyboard.  I absolutely love this thing.  I have read quite a few comments online disrespecting the Lead 3 and I just don’t understand it.  It sounds amazing to me and the interface with the rotary encoders and LED rings is ideal.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=20000&sid=481dcbd6d8be8d30e242f9604ed34c6f#p20000

It’s a “square low cut” shape, set to cut under 100 Hz.It reduced some of the proximity (loudness) effect, and some of the loud noises I made touching / taping things like the mic / standAdded a 2nd point to enhance high-mid frequencies, coz my voice sounded more like I hear it normally.Added a 3rd point to cut high frequencies that fo not come from the voice. It’s a “square high cut” shape, set to 8.5 KHz. It diminished the “sss” too.Setting method : Start with no eq, add 1 point, set the frequency, the gain, then the Q until it sounds natural.Pic:EQ.jpg (31.25 KiB) Viewed 2295 timesCompressor :Make the voice volume more constant. I targeted a 0db output, otherwise I found it introduced a hearable distortion.The threshold around -7 db takes the voice when its volume becomes interesting to make it ‘constant’.The knee at 6db makes the transition soft.I raised the ratio to 1.6, not more, or it sounded distorted / less natural.On the graph under, horizontal axis is the input, vertical axis is the output.Pic:Compressor.jpg (26.27 KiB) Viewed 2295 timesFilter, Delay, Reverb :No particular intent here, just a matter of taste.Pic:filter_delay_reverb.jpg (36.86 KiB) Viewed 2295 timesPic of another choice :filter_reverb.jpg (39.74 KiB) Viewed 2295 timesAbout the DAWThe recording, on the first post, was made under Logic and some of my bad settings.I decided to go (back) to Ableton Live because I see more clearly what I’m doing with it.Similar setup was done under Reaper too.The “Lite” version of Ableton that I use is limited to 6 build in effects/plugins per project.- END -",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=40402&sid=481dcbd6d8be8d30e242f9604ed34c6f#p40402

BTW the mod wheel goes from 0 too 100% on the osc shape, and I generously and almost randomly modify it with my hand during playing.Someone also commented me on the brass being too prominent and even artificial... might replace that with something else for other recordings. Right now I am focusing on recording 1 song a day to gain some experience on audio editing. For that I record several takes of ""live"" solos and then just ""glue"" them together pasting the best sounding stuff and eliminating the mistakes (like missing a beat, or tonal mistakes). I have done 2 other songs but they were not so great since I was still experimenting a bit with latency and recording with my Zoom H6 but today its Witch Hunt day!

On the walls, I'd put up curtain tracks and use curtains (thicker the better) over the walls. Alternatively, you could use acoustic foam, but it's not cheap.I think the wierd resonance is due to where the noise is cancelling out. With curtains over the windows, you've got rid of the most reflective surfaces. However the walls and floor will reflect and then get damped by your own bodies (as it's a small room and there are a few of you in there) - but because you're all standing in different places and possibly moving, it's not going to be a consistent cancellation.If you can damp the walls/floor as above, then the reduced reflection will mean less sound being damped by people/instruments and make the acoustic more consistent.Hope this is of some use!Cheers,Rob.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=29410&sid=26ad6d1723e03c9c3e0c3d48dba617ca#p29410

Disclaimer: I've never done this, though I have tried to edit recordings from a rehearsal room and wished I had prepared for that systematically.First, generate a chirp signal, for example in Audacity (""Generate"" menu). For a start, you can try a logarithmic chirp from 50 to 12800 Hz with a duration of 16 seconds; this will give you two seconds per octave and aligns nicely with the equalization tool in Audacity. Play this sound through the speakers in your rehearsal room, e.g. as a sample from your Nord Stage, and record the result just like you would record a song. It should obviously still be a chirp, with as little background noise as possible, but it will have lots of bumps due to room resonances. Load this result into some audio editing software again, and create an EQ curve that turns it back to the original constant-amplitude chirp (""Effect""/""Equalization"" in Audacity). (You might have to do multiple EQ passes in series, using large filter lengths for low frequencies and smaller filter lengths for higher frequencies; just always use the smallest length that works.) Be sure to save the EQ curve(s) you use. After you have created one or more EQ curves that neutralize the resonances, just apply these curves to your recorded songs as well.If you are lucky, everything will sound better, but there is also the possibility that your keyboard will sound better (because it runs through the same speakers) but everything else will sound worse. In any case, you probably need to apply one additional EQ to reduce bass frequencies because your speakers cannot reproduce them as well as higher frequencies, causing you to amplify them too much.In case you get satisfactory results and want to reuse the EQ curves over multiple rehearsals, make sure the speakers and microphone are always at the same place.There might be tools to do this sort of thing, but I'm not an expert at all.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=29440&sid=26ad6d1723e03c9c3e0c3d48dba617ca#p29440

It's more like, I own one and sometimes I play things on it. That is because most of my time I practice on my Kawai Grand Piano, band rehearsals and gigs are done only with my Nord Stage 2 SW 73 and since I am not dedicated to music, with college I am left very little time, which I spend mostly with my girlfriend. So as you may guess, I have no time to spend composing or doing midi tracks! And even if I did midi things, I'd compose it on my computer and then use a midi interface I have around.Yet, I do agree about that Korg sound, I love it. Just not the Pianos or the Organs. But the synthesizer sounds are superb and the orchestral and drum sounds ain't that bad. So I guess I am satisfied with its sound, even though I rarely use it.

For me that detracts a bit from the 'core' of the song.Some things I like/don't like:Faint ringing on the right channel, which happens through-out the song. You can especially hear it well from 0:06 to 0:10 (until the piano starts). Might be a compression artifact.0:47 - 0:53 I think the 'bouncing' bell like sound is a distraction.0:42 - 0:48 I like the changes in the filtering of the snare (or what is it?), since for me it adds more life yet doesn't loose connection with the rest of the song even though it is changing quite rapidly.1:03 - I like the 'mzzzz' sound just right of the middle, that is slowly changing and maintained over a few seconds - gives it more body. The same goes for the other atmospheric sounds shortly after this point in the song.1:12 - the 'blip' is maybe a bit loud, though in itself not out of place1:20 - I like the synth sound that starts at this point, it really adds something I think1:25 - here the music gets really 'busy', but in a good way - there seems to be cohesion between the things going on.1:35 - I think this string-like synth sound works well at this point.1:46 - Hmm, nice sound.1:57 - Yes!! The bit happening here (filter resonance?) is the best bit in the song, I think.2:02 - I have trouble following what the piano is doing here (this is probably my fault, not yours).2:13 - More filter goodness? What bugs me a bit is how it starts out in the right channel, seems to pan a bit between left and right for a second and then sits in the middle again.2:33 - 2:48 This bit bugged me the first few times I heard it, but it sounds just right to me now.2:43 - 2:46 These up-lifting chords make me want to play Final Fantasy again. That's a compliment.I like the piano, but I'm not completely sure about the reverb on it (or what I perceive as reverb).Anyway, just coughing up some hairballs. I don't even know the rights terms to use, so please take my comments with a grain of salt.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=31715&sid=26ad6d1723e03c9c3e0c3d48dba617ca#p31715

When you go to try out the Electro 3, you should probably pay extra attention to how usable the use of samples on the E3 would be for you. I say this, because SampleTank has more features than the E3 when it comes to samples. For example, you can have a maximum of 1 sample per key, so you cannot do any form of velocity switching.The E3 is also mono-timbral, so you can only use one instrument at a time. For example, you cannot use a piano and a pad sound at the same time.  There are ways to 'fake' it using samples, but in general you'll loose the dynamics of the piano. The E3 also cannot do splits nor is it meant for controlling external equipment. While you would be able to use (for example) SampleTank to make the pad sounds to go with a piano sound on the E3, you wouldn't be able to (flexibly) switch sounds on the SampleTank from the E3 nor could you use splits (unless SampleTank could do that internally using a single MIDI channel).A second hand Stage Ex would be able to do those things (and probably cost about the same), but with weighted keys it would be quite a bit heavier. A 88-key Stage with a weighted keyboard is light for a full-size stage piano, but I think it still weighs a whopping 25 kg (or something like that).",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=22360&sid=26ad6d1723e03c9c3e0c3d48dba617ca#p22360

The Bass player will be playing the E (as it is written in his part) and so you can omit this note from your chord.  Therefore your Left Hand will be playing G,B,D,F#.  However, if you do not have a Bass player present then you will need to play E,G,B,D (unless you have very long fingers and can stretch all 5 x notes with your left hand !!).The same rules apply to the A13 chord.  So (upwards) G,B,C#,F# if you have a Bass player.  If not then G,A,C#,E.Notice that i have included to ROOT (E and A), and omitted the upper-extension (F#  and F#) in the chord if there is no Bass player present.These types of voicings sound good when written for Trombones in a big band (though i did not do so in this arrangement because i chose to let the Rhythm Section play these particular chords, and to feature the upper Trombones playing the melody on the B Section of the tune).Hope that answers your questions.Best,Paul",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=20979&sid=7633c74b00d0315e99996386cd25f224#p20979

Generally speaking, good Harmony consists of one chord smoothly moving (resolving) into another.  And this is produced by applying good Voice Leading.Because this piece is a MODAL composistion, i could have written it in OPEN KEY (ie. with NO Key Signature).  But because each Section has such a strong sense of Tonality, i decided to assign Key Signatures (those being of the respective Relative Majors).For IMPROVISATORY Scale choices, i would use E Dorian (D Major) for the A Sections and F Dorian (Eb Major) for the B Section.i hope you find this useful.............Best,Paul",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=21138&sid=7633c74b00d0315e99996386cd25f224#p21138

Fellow Dutchie, are you?No, that's the mirror. I am pretty much ITB nowadays and the NP88 and FanX7 are the only hardware I am left with. I do plan to replace the latter with a MotifXF7 sometime later this year.The Fantom pianos do sound a lot better when played from weighted keys, but they have a 'plasticky' quality and don't hold up when used with subpar amplification (which is most of the time). Roland's best sounds are on the expansion boards, the stuff in the Fantom is meh. But they really excel at velocity response and aftertouch. I am reprogramming the board as I no longer need it for piano/ep/clav duties.For now I'm using the factory sounds in the NP88, but when I get some time I'm gonna check out the other libraries. I heard the Bosendorfer and Bright Grand samples at Dave Ferris' place, but I kind of prefer the 'woodiness' of the Lady D.

I think the metal bottom plate acts as a resonator for vibrations generated by playing on the keys. Dampening the bottom plate might be more effective. I suppose you could stick some of that 'asphalt' (bitumen) tape on the bottom under the keys - that stuff is used for sound isolating sheet metal parts in cars, HVAC, etc. It is made of tar and fairly heavy/rubbery.To see if this actually would help, you could try playing the keys while pressing your flat hand firmly against the bottom plate (say below where you're playing) to see if the sound is noticeably less.

With the right sounds, the DX7 became very usable.Edit: Actually, I think the Datadisk came later, at first I photocopied blank patch charts and laboriously copied sounds I liked parameter-by-parameter. 147 on a DX7 if I remember correctly.

We have just released our latest and last album ""PFSF"".  I wouldn't go so far as saying that this is a 'Nord-heavy' album, there are in fact 7 different keyboards used in the recordings.  The ""B3"" tone is from a Nord C2 through a Leslie 860, if you're interested.  The over-all sound is something of a psychedelic approach to folk-rock.  As of January of this year and after 4 years, we no longer will be playing together as other projects demand more of our time and focus.

When set up in a push/pull arrangement, subs can be devastatingly effective in a Rave, House, Dub mix.Every time that I have tried to use stage monitoring with 15"" instead of 12"" or 10"" for keys, I find myself rolling the bass off because the increased bass frequencies of the 15"" prevent me from adequately hearing/feeling what the drummer and bass player are doing.Hope this helps.Cheers, Hanon",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=11132&sid=7633c74b00d0315e99996386cd25f224#p11132

My background is classical piano training when I was a kid, more or less forced by my parents. I think for about 8 years. I didn't enjoy it a lot and was not motivated. I now realize I could have work much harder. I recently had a renewed interest, and I think Clavia is in part responsible for this. My ultimate goal with orchestral sounds is to do the Mozart (I'm his #1 fan and even moved my tough piano teacher playing it one timeconcertos (one solo piano vs the orchestra), so this Adagio was an easy piece to try to experiment and find a sound. I'd record 2 tracks: the piano solo, and a piano transcription of the orchestra. But again, I'm not very optimistic, all this does is making me realize how great an orchestra is. Hence my attempts to do it electronic, but then the more I tweak it to my liking, the less electronic it becomes, and when it ends up like an orchestra, what's the point, a real orchestra does it better.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=9480&sid=7c648cb94d55a9953a0073c2656eb7b3#p9480

176866,25,7c648cb94d55a9953a0073c2656eb7b3,p9425,"My new NS2 76 setup, accessories & amplification",2156,Malliflitti,2011-11-21T14:42:13+00:00,False,,"New user, thought I'd share some thoughts about my setup.Former setupI used to have a NE3 73 and a Yamaha S90ES (great piano sound). I like a simple and portable setup, so I never gigged with both of them together. Mostly I was gigging with the NE3, but I was never happy with the piano sound (especially not when playing mono) and the keybed for piano playing. So I found myself playing mostly organ or rhodes.My amplifier was an AER AG8, which is a little, light, but strong and powerful amplifier, with a great sound although a little too ""muddy"" for piano sounds.My keyboard stand was a Ultimate Support V-stand. It is not available anymore, although I still think it was the best and coolest stand in the world.NS2I now bought the NS2 76 HA to have both keyboards in one, and to rediscover the joy of piano playing. It is a fantastic instrument, but it is not easy to use - you need to read the manual. I still need a lot of time to discover all the possibilities.My main concern is the piano sound. The Bosendorfer XL is fantastic in stereo, and acceptable in mono. I do hope Clavia will once release a mono piano sound as good as the mono S90ES piano sound.Soft case & flightcaseI bought the Nord soft case. It's sturdy enough (much more padding then the NE3 soft case) and has good wheels. It also holds the music stand and the keyboard stand. But some critics...You cannot hold the bag at the top handle and then roll it, because then the angle with the ground is too small, and the bag touches the ground. You need to use the handle in the middle of the bag and hold the piano in a 70° angle, which is not very handy.When you first want to use the bag, you have to insert the padding in a right way. I did not do this good enough apparently, because there was still some zipper not covered, which damaged the side of my NS2.I also bought a flightcase in the event that it will be transported by someone else or perhaps (if I'm lucky) to travel by plane:http://www.thomann.de/be/thon_keyboard_ ... i_holz.htm. I am happy with it, although the wheels are not of the best quality.Nord Keyboard StandAlthough I am very happy with my V-Stand, the convenience of ""everything in one bag"" and the lower weight convinced me to buy the Nord Keyboard Stand.  It is very sturdy, and it is easier to move the NS, as the stand is attached to it.  It of course takes a minute or two to set up, whereas the V-stand was a matter of seconds.My greatest concern are the alternative longer tubes to play standing up. They simply aren't long enough, and I am of average height (1m75). I plan to modify the longer tubes by also adding a screw thread on the other side of the tube. I can then combine the shorter and the longer tubes to play in a standing position. To be continued.Nord Music StandLightweight, sturdy, extra wide, easy to install (just slide it in the keyboard) and fits in the Nord soft case. Absolutely recommended.AmplificationAs the stereo piano sound is so good, I decided to buy a pair of Electrovoice ZXA1-100 amplifiers, and the Yamaha Stagepas 300 trolley to transport them. I will probably get a JBL EON 510 bag too, for when I only need one of them.They sound as close to hifi speakers as you can get, go quite loud (although I have the impression my AG8 could go louder), and are small and lightweight. Biggest concern here is the hiss, which is there when you power on the speakers. This makes it unuseable in room practice/studio applications, but it is not noticeable on stage, except maybe for very quiet venues or classical performances.So now I have a setup that fits in nearly every car, and I can carry both the piano, stand and amps in one time from car to stage. Moreover, the NS2 is a pleasure to play on. Spent a lot of money, but I'm happy I did.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=9425&sid=7c648cb94d55a9953a0073c2656eb7b3#p9425

I've pulled out the original cramped dinette and uncomfortable settee, and am building a console system with four 12U rack spaces and a desktop just under 8 feet wide. Lots of geekery is afoot, with a network of Arduino nodes, robust ham radio station, lab instruments, and systems... and with my musical interests, of course I have to have a built-in keyboard as well. My current rig is a Roland RD-700SX, and while I like it and have certainly not outgrown it, the physical size is relatively bulky and the user-interface paradigm is a bit cumbersome.So after a few weeks of agonizing over the choices (integrated workstations like Motif), a MIDI controller augmented by a rack synth and/or software instruments, downsizing to something cheap and expendable for the harsh environment, or just living with what I have which really isn't bad at all)... I seem to have latched on the Stage 2 as the perfect solution. Not only is it as tidy dimensionally as such a machine can get, but I love the immediate editability of the control panel and the overall look. I haven't even touched one yet, but am pretty sure one is in my near future.This boat project (Nomadness) is the successor to my earlier technomadic geekery - a computerized recumbent bicycle on which I traveled 17,000 miles around the US back in the 80s, and then the Microship, an amphibian pedal/solar/sail micro-trimaran. The new boat, at 44 feet, is quite a bit more comfortable.

I'm really looking forward to re-recording them with the Nord). I really wish I had started long ago, and not at age 54.As to finding the time for gonzo engineering projects... it's what I do for a living.  I used to joke, while pedaling around the US on theWinnebikoand its successors, that it was a shame my old high-school guidance counselor never suggested this as a career option. In a sense, I never outgrew science fairs; my career, so to speak, is to build bizarre contraptions (though never gratuitously bizarre), travel with them, write about the adventures, and try to mine the systems for the occasional product spin-off.  (That last one has always been my weakness; I tend to just publish everything, which is easier but much less profitable.)The piano integration on the boat should be fun, and will be strongly shaped by this important truth:Water corrodes. Salt water corrodes absolutely.That translates into conformal coatings, a stowage system that sheds stray droplets past (and not into) the piano, vapor-phase corrosion inhibitors, improved sealing, and a few spares for I/O devices.  That latter is actually one of the things that most attracts me to this machine... it looks very solidly built, with real hardware for controls instead of a big touchscreen. Serviceability is a huge issue for anything that goes to sea, and even though this will be very well coddled in its mounting nest, it's still a challenging environment when things get feisty.As this comes together, I'll post here... the Stage 2 should integrate very smoothly into the wrap-around console, right down to the fonts and graphics.Oh, here's the ""land-based"" studio with that Roland I mentioned.  This pic is from 2007 or so, shortly after I built the desk:The Roland will go to eBay, and I'll probably sell that wonderful Mackie mixer... it's dead silent, but would not be at all console-mountable on the boat. For that, I picked up an Edirol M16DX, which separates the control surface from the black box bristling with connectors. A bit more hiss, but it solves a huge packaging problem.Cheers!Steve",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=9185&sid=7c648cb94d55a9953a0073c2656eb7b3#p9185

Although my main gig at the moment is The Skanx, a 9-piece ska/funk/reggae outfit (see earlier post  about my rig), my musical roots are definitely in the blues. And the Wurly is my favourite keyboard sound - it's so funky and expressive and fun to play. And it goes surprisingly well with upright bass, a combination you unfortunately don't hear very often (think ""Mercy, Mercy, Mercy""). That's why I played upright bass rather than bass guitar on my recording.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=9174&sid=7c648cb94d55a9953a0073c2656eb7b3#p9174

When I started, I used a Casio WK-3000 for all my sounds - it's actually got a very good Wurly sound for the price, plus a dedicated drawbar organ and Leslie sim. I added a Stylophone to this fairly early on, playing them through a no-name 30-watt guitar combo.Towards the end of 2009, the band bought a vintage Wurlitzer 200, just in time to use it alongside the Casio's organ sound on the recordings for our début EP. I upgraded my amplification to an 80-watt 4-channel keyboard amp.In early 2011 we unfortunately had to stop gigging with the Wurlitzer as it was too heavy, fragile and temperamental. At the same time, the band bought a second-hand Roland VK-7 drawbar organ, and I have been using that ever since, along with the Casio's Wurlitzer sound until two weeks ago, when my father bought me a Nord Electro 3 73 for a (very generous) 50th birthday present! The reason I still use the Roland is that in many songs I use piano and organ at the same time, or change between them too quickly to switch sounds.Current rig:Stylophone S1Roland VK-7 organNord Electro 3 73the t.amp PA4080-KB combo ampFatar sustain pedalSchaller volume pedal with stereo splitter cableSimon Beck",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=8491&sid=7c648cb94d55a9953a0073c2656eb7b3#p8491

I like simple solutions, and having the rack available to twiddle was a great advantage. In case you're wondering, it's not balancing by itself, it's secured with a couple of spider cables! Wait till you see my Amazing Simple Pedalboard Solution For The DIY-Challenged.The venue was the Mathew Street Festival in Liverpool, and I was playing for a Killers tribute band called The Fillers. It was a fun but very challenging gig. Believe it or not, my kbd setup was not really adequate for the amount of parts and sounds I needed. Nothing difficult to play, but a nightmare logistically.Yes, that was the same frustration with the MOSS board.

I hear its near to impossible to do so! and which sound do you get from that? Doesn't the Stage's FM section produce close enough results?About the VA... from what I have heard, the NL2x sounds more ""analogue"" than the Nord Lead 3, but of course that may be subjective. Also keep in mind you can get a brand new NL2x and that is not the case with the NL3. Another VA I would consider is something blue from novation (nova series). The new ultranova is probably their best VA but it has a very ""limited"" physical interface, although it is supposedly made to be easy to manipulate. I just gotta love those liquid filters!!

Instead, I have a a large collection of pro Voice sounds which I have painstakingly gathered over the years from producers, session players and the like, which I then ""mix and match"" in Performances to get what I need. The two main reasons I bought a TX802 (again!) are:1. While ROMplers (or the Stage) provide basic DX-type sounds like bells and so on, if it doesn't have a sound I need, it's pretty much impossible to synthesise it from scratch on a non-DX type synth. I am a professional working musician, ""close enough"" isn't good enough for me, I often need to reproduce sounds for the original artiste, and my sound design has to be spot-on. Plus I have lots of cool bass, pad etc type sounds which I love cos they have a very different flavour from analogue synthesis.2. My Extreme gets used a lot, and its limited 8-part multitimbrality is an issue (I try to use one Combi per song for live performance). Handing some sounds over to other synths should leave the Triton free to do what it does best instead of trying to get it to do everything at once.About VA, I was looking for opinions about which synth to get. I thought a Nord would be best for me, as it needs to be reliable, multitimbral, have plenty of polyphony, and have pretty much all the knobs I need on the front panel. A true analog would possibly sound better, but modern analog synths are very expensive for what they deliver.I know the debate between the sound of the 2X versus the Lead 3 - some say the difference is like night and day, while others say the difference is pretty minor. I haven't seen anything on Youtube demos that convinces me that there's much real difference between them, and the Lead 3's enhanced synthesis capabilites, keyboard aftertouch, and front panel design - which many people say is simply the best layout ever - are pretty convincing. On the other hand, both synths suffer from limited 4 octave keyboards and a complete lack on onboard EQ or effects, so my mind isn't made up yet. All suggestions welcomed!To any admins: I know this is a Nord forum, but I am hoping that it would be good to have an area for discussions on other synths as well; all synths are dear to my heart and I love any opportunity to exchange knowledge, or indeed just general chit-chat, about our favourite toys.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=7296&sid=7c648cb94d55a9953a0073c2656eb7b3#p7296

I wanted a Tetra, but there was noneSince I could not resist buying something, I decided to look at all things. Microkorg was ruled out as I have an MS2000BR at home I rarely use. Then the microsampler was fun but sampling is not really my style. So all left was the Korg R3, Novation Ultranova, Alesis Ion and Alesis Miniak. I am going to transport it by plane, so the Ion was a little bit to big for me to fit in my luggage. Then I truly disliked the Miniak Interface. The R3's vocoder was superb while the Ultranova's disappointed. Then there is those ridiculous R3's mini pitch and modulation wheels and the displays are not all that clear to see. Ultranova is Blue and that fits with my non black keyboard rig, plus it has got a very nice interface and the display I found was very clear and easy to read. Then for other sounds I just could not appreciate them good enough and decide to go for the one i liked the most on demoes and that was the Ultranova. I mean, just check this one out:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNov2RJu5nwDaniel Fisher from sweetwaterSo I do not have a laptop nor 1/4 inch plugs so I got to wait till I get home to actually play it (which is tonight in midnight). but so far it is very nice quality considering it is plastic, good interace and great keybed. My only gripe is that the knobs are wobly but they do not feel flimsy so I have mixed feelings in that regard.So that's my story, I will post it in another thread and put a review of it afterward comparing it to the nord stage and my mopho.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=7390&sid=7c648cb94d55a9953a0073c2656eb7b3#p7390

It is heavy and its odd shape makes it difficult to grab and maneuver onto a stand.

I think I have about 200 hours of recordings, and I have trimmed them down to several motifs (just about 1 or 2 hours of motifs) and I have several ideas I actually think I can materialize into songs, even got some ""bare bones"" for very epic prog-rock songs. I record almost all of my personal practice sessions and afterwards just cut the notably practice part and leave those little improvisations for later. That´s how most of the stuff I posted came to be, just me messing with sounds or practicing when I happened to have the camera on.I actually have several pieces written and recorded but my biggest problem is doing lyrics. So I actually hesitate on posting those since they are very far from being complete. I got a sort of poprock piece with just a few words sung (which I wrote with a guitarist) and also a piano ballad which are just missing the lyrics. Since I just got into vacations and have 2 free weeks I will try to write them down and post them afterwards.I also got a very funky weird piece that is just the nord stage and drums, I will do it an instrumental and probably will post it today or tomorrow.My girlfriend is probably better than me at doing lyrics, so I will see if she helps me do some decent ones!The problem is that vacations are rarely totally free-time! I got a few days worth of work to do with my home´s network and I got to put up a server for my dad, that could take easily a few days. But whenever I get inspired I will make sure to go record somethings!!BTW I am 19 and started music in my 15s (my parents never got me to take lessons and I decided to go by myself), and its always nice to hear good things from people with more than 7 times my experience!!Best Regards,Gustavo",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=2825&sid=7c648cb94d55a9953a0073c2656eb7b3#p2825

Are you talking about adding bass on Discopop only, or on all the songs (e.g. the piano improvisations)? I agree that I should add bass to Discopop. I just recorded the song at first, and I didn't have time to add the bass.

Maybe playing a groovemachine like the affordable AKAI XR20 would make it easier to record your drums.Yeah I play the drums from software (IK Multimedia Sampletank 2.5) through midi on the Nord Stage. I don't have too much experince with how to make drums tight and sound good. I just play drums like I am a drummer on the keyboard lol. Maybe a groovemachine would help. I use Cubase LE to record and I think it has some possibilities to make drums tighter and stuff, but I just haven't studied it too much.Johannes wrote:And nice sound radindrops, I like the gently layered synth.

I will definitely put it up later on the day (my day still has about 17 hours left ;) )I also have more sounds that use the LFO to sound like a sequencer, although I am not the first one to think of doing something like this:http://www.sonicstate.com/articles/article.cfm?id=146Although I did stumbled upon the NS´s pseudo sequencer by ""mistake"" I put the lfo in the cyclic mode, attack on fastest, decay at about half, played a polyphonic phrase and found out that it repeated the phrase.BUT there is somehting I did not mention, I dunno if the video shows it, but doing what I did tends to leave a sort of noise level onthat patch and on other patches it sounded like you are holding a pad. Which makes it sound like two sounds at the same time but can be annoying if you only want the pseudo-sequenceSaludos,Gustavo",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=902&sid=6bc7d19fea2f37d27f475548547d74f8#p902

Again, it is all real time, no editing.I attached the program I used: here is a quick walkthrough:Panel A, simply a Grand with some synth strings, the volume of the syth strings is controlled via the controll pedal. On panel B there is a wurlie on the upper side with a synth bass on the left side. The fliter sweep on the synth bass is controlled also via the controll pedal.GusHere is the link to the tune:http://rapidshare.com/files/247443858/E ... v.ogg.html",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=243&sid=6bc7d19fea2f37d27f475548547d74f8#p243
