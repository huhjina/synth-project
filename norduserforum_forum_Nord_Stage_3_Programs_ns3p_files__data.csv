An excellent source of information on synthesizers and the keys to programming is the collection of SOS magazine old articles called Synth Secrets athttps://www.soundonsound.com/techniques ... d-on-sound(thanks Mr_-G- for the link!). Stage 3 synth programming tutorials can also be found atnord-stage-forum-f3/nord-stage-3-synth- ... 17063.html(thanks Ivan Jochner!), and a whole set of Nord tutorials by member ""My Keys to Music"" can be found on the YouTube channelhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_xKuR ... BvAc63Y9qw(thanks Marc!).IMPORTANT: My NS3 is loaded with different pianos (""L"" instead of ""XL"" versions for example) so after downloading a program you might have to relink the piano with one you have. My pianos and programs listherewill help. I also use a control pedal (Yamaha FC-7) on almost all of my programs, so one will be needed to take advantage of the morphing that's part of the programs.The program below started out as the preloaded ""Furious AT Lead"" program. After a bit of messing around, I came up with two variations that I thought were ""interesting"" and may hopefully be something that helps you further your understanding of what the Stage 3 synth can do as well. Slot A is a synth with a higher harmonic that comes in as the filter is decaying into the LFO range.  Slot B is a different synth that starts out with the following settings: LFO MOD ENV about 0, OSC CTRL on 6, FREQ on 1, and RES/FREQ on 6.  On the Slot B MP3 you can hear a percussive sound in the notes played low with the left hand; the sounds become more ""aggressive"" as the FREQ knob is turned slowly from 1 up to about 4 or 5 with the right hand.  All of the synth sounds heard after that are the result of turning just those four knobs and playing around. Every Synth program in the Stage 3 is an opportunity to learn, so turn, tweak, and save your work to go back to and tweak again. Have fun.Slot A WannitBBBadSyncW.mp3Slot B WannitBBBadSyncW.mp3WannitBBBadSyncW.ns3fProgramming example(574 Bytes) Downloaded 2360 timesUPDATE 12/19/2018:Below are a few more to mess around with. This first one is a program with both a record scratch effect and a synth with a LFO filter effect. The MOD ENV ATTACK determines how quickly the filter will sweep up and the MOD ENV DECAY determines the sweep down:LFOFilterSweep W.mp3LFOFilterSweep W.ns3fStage 3 program - one synth with a filter effect on the LFO, nice for solo or chords, and another synth with a record scratch effect also included.(592 Bytes) Downloaded 2495 timesThis second program I believe started with a pre-loaded program Weightless Pad that I modified with LFO filter, arpeggio, and panning effects synced to the internal clock.Weightless Pad W.mp3Weightless Pad W.ns3fModified version of Weightless Pad with filter and arpeggio effects(574 Bytes) Downloaded 2487 timesThe third program is a slightly percussive synth sound that seems to work well for solo or chords.

Listen through to the end with headphones to hear more of the second synth come in.  Both LFOs are synced to the internal clock.LFOSampHldSweepW.mp3LFOSampHldSweepW.ns3fStage 3 program that has a random S/H on the LFO and a triangle LFO filter effect on a pad, new v6 Rhodes, and Hammond.(592 Bytes) Downloaded 2510 timesAnalog Brass.This next program is simply a version of Analog Brass with the synth settings eliminating the need to add the Chorus effect so it can be used on the Piano. This has Velocity=1, however if you're trying to recreate an early 80s brass sound of a Prophet or Oberheim for example, Velocity should be off. The MP3 example covers the sound and then adds Slot B with a Pop Brass sample.AnalogBrass    W.mp3AnalogBrass    W.ns3fStage 3 program - Analog Brass with no chorus effect needed.

Over the last few months I’ve posted quite a few programs that may not be something you’d use playing out, but could learn from if you don’t know how you would recreate it yourself.  Below are samples of some of those programs and links to original posts. Quite a few others can be listened to at the other posts listed.

I set it at 24 semitones initially so that turning the knob during performance will take it to 48 semitones (and no further) for the rest of the song. The effect is similar to the Sequential Circuits Prophet 5 where the OSC Frequency also moves in steps when the knob is turned.  The program can be found atLINK-->nord-stage-3-programs-ns3p-ns3pb-files- ... 20405.htmlStage 3 - Loverboy Turn Me Loose.mp3Stage 3 - Loverboy Turn Me Loose v2.mp3In order to get three synth sounds with two synth Panels for ""Gimme Gimme Gimme"" by ABBA, I took the approach of using a Stage 3 string sample and adding a high triangle wave with OSC 2 (balancing the two with OSC CTRL), leaving the other synth panel for the bass synth. Using a synth panel for two different sounds happened to work out in this case but you'll find that getting the ""perfect"" sound for one OSC sometimes means compromising on the sound of the other given that the Attack, Decay, and other synth parameters have to be applied to both. For example, my choice of triangle wave over pulse (square) wave was somewhat driven by the strings not being bright enough if I adjusted the FREQ to sound good for the square wave. If you don't need to get all the synths out of one program, flexibility opens up some. At the link below I also provide a program using an Oberheim sample provided by Funk76 for the high ""flute"" sound in place of the bass synth, and the strings are covered by the other synth panel.

For the first program I set it up so the intro pad and panning/phase shifter ""strings"" are on the left hand with the latter being on the Control Pedal. The right hand is set up for playing chords, but the actual sound to use is with the second program, where the left hand still has the panning/phase shifter strings and the right hand has sort-of a muted electronic clavinet. After listening to the song again, I'd speed up the phase shifter just a little bit with both programs. If you don't play in stereo you'll lose the panning effect, however you can replace it with a slow tremolo just to vary the volume a little which is similar to hearing one channel more than the other.Cher Believe 1 W.ns3f(592 Bytes) Downloaded 468 timesCher Believe 2 W.ns3f(592 Bytes) Downloaded 442 timesMP3_example_of_Stage_3_Programs_for_Believe_by_Cher.mp3I worked as well withGyauhmhelping on two programs forHelene Fischer's ""Atemolos"" (For the second part of the song, I downloaded a small steel drum sample to use along with strings for a little percussive effect and used the control pedal to increase the FREQ and a couple levels.

I'm now retired and finding more time to... well, anything I want! Below are links to a few programs that I worked on recently. Take care.Steely Dan's ""Peg"" - program and samples. This program uses two samples; one is a modified sax used as the Lyricon combined with backing vocals for the chorus, the other is a very small Clavinet sample (198 Kb) used along with the Lyricon for the intro.  Though many may not use the backing vocals, I sampled some of Michael McDonald's isolated vocals from a video on ""Aja"" and layered them over other backing vocals where needed to have the full chorus available.  The Lyricon has two ranges in the sample so that the notes are at the correct pitch while the Clavinet alternates between high and low notes in the intro.  The Stage 3 program has a Rhodes with Phase Shifter layered with a Clavinet with Flanger, panned slightly left and right respectively.  Pitch-corrected samples of the Lyricon/vocals are also provided for those transposing down a semitone (-1).  As this program uses only samples in the synth panels, it could easily be set up on a Stage 2 as well.  To make the MP3 demo, I made a backing track with bass, drums, and guitar at Karaoke Version - all other parts are covered by the Stage 3 program available at:LINK -->nord-stage-3-programs-ns3p-ns3pb-files- ... 21984.htmlFrom the program I also created a sample for players of other Nord keyboards covering the Lyricon, vocals, and layered Rhodes/Clavinet with effects that can be found at:LINK -->nord-user-samples-nsmp-samples-f14/stee ... 21985.htmlSteely Dan - Peg W DEMO.mp3Four Clavinets with Effects.Using the small Clavinet sample I put together for ""Peg"", I made this program just to give folks a head start on a few Clavinet settings.

On the MP3 I step through multiple settings starting with the Clavinet sample and ending with all four Clavinets layered with Flanger and Auto-Wah on both synths.

The first program has a pad left of the split and a mono synth with glide right of the split to cover the initial intro. The second program moves both synths to the left to add a soft Silver Grand to the right.  Simply by design, my old Prophet 10 tracked the highest note played when in mono mode, so I could play a full synth chord with one ""panel"" and have the layered mono synth of the other play just the highest note. On the Stage 3, adding a high ""violin"" to a full B3 chord for a song by Kansas for example could be easy if the synth featured high tracking in mono mode, however instead one has to play each chord so that the top note is the last one hit or the mono synth will go to an unintended key.  I play it carefully that way in the mp3, but having high tracking as a synth feature would be much easier.Stage 3 program -->nord-stage-3-programs-ns3p-ns3pb-files- ... ml#p152351Muse Resistance2W Demo.mp3""Ashes to Ashes"" by David Bowie.

I set it at 24 semitones initially so that turning the knob during performance will take it to 48 semitones (and no further) for the rest of the song. The effect is similar to the Sequential Circuits Prophet 5 where the OSC Frequency also moves in steps when the knob is turned.

Using a synth panel for two different sounds happened to work out in this case but you'll find that getting the ""perfect"" sound for one OSC sometimes means compromising on the sound of the other given that the Attack, Decay, and other synth parameters have to be applied to both. For example, my choice of triangle wave over pulse (square) wave was somewhat driven by the strings not being bright enough if I adjusted the FREQ to sound good for the square wave. If you don't need to get all the synths out of one program, flexibility opens up some. At the link below I also provide a program using an Oberheim sample provided by Funk76 for the high ""flute"" sound in place of the bass synth, and the strings are covered by the other synth panel.

Using a synth panel for two different sounds happened to work out in this case but you'll find that getting the ""perfect"" sound for one OSC sometimes means compromising on the sound of the other given that the Attack, Decay, and other synth parameters have to be applied to both. For example, my choice of triangle wave over pulse (square) wave was somewhat driven by the strings not being bright enough if I adjusted the FREQ to sound good for the square wave. ....At the link below I also provide a program using an Oberheim sample provided by Funk76 for the high ""flute"" sound in place of the bass synth, and the strings are covered by the other synth panel.

How do you accomplish this?As noted in my original post with the programs, one is somewhat limited with what can be done to the sound of OSC2 (the high ""flute"") without also affecting the sound of OSC1. Unison mode can add a detuning effect however it tends to sound bad with some samples such as the strings. I updated the program ""ABBA GmeGmeGme W.ns3f"" to morph chorus to the synth flute/strings when OSC2 is turned up with the Mod Wheel. You could also try the other program ""ABBA GmeGmeGmesW.ns3f"" which uses a sample created by Funk76 that is closer to the original analog flute sound, however the sample is 4MB and not sure worth the difference of losing use of the bass. You can go further and create your own sample to have both bass and strings on one panel, leaving the other for the synth flute (synth or sample).

Here's a program with the NS3 Master Clock synced to the LFO rate, arpeggiator rate, A-Pan rate, and Delay tempo.  Panel A has a piano with delay, and a synth with A-Pan, Env Filter sweep (up and down), and LFO affecting the OSC1 and OSC2 X-Fade mix. Panel B has a synth with A-Pan, Env Filter sweep (down), LFO affecting the OSC1 and OSC2 X-Fade mix, and arpeggiator.  The program uses a Control Pedal on both synths to adjust the levels.After playing an initial chord in the demo, I start with the piano, bring up the Panel A synth with the control pedal, and then add the panel B synth (initially off when you load the program).  I then switch on the arpeggiator on the Panel B synth to end the demo.On their own, the Panel A and B synths can yield numerous variations on the sound just by selection of the OSC1 synth type and waveform used with the X-Fade.  Panel A for example uses an OSC1 waveform with a harmonic that comes in and out at the LFO rate.  Among other options, it's worth playing around with the OSC1 selection, pitch of OSC2, LFO waveform, and the OSC2 Ctrl.  One can then move to checking out the parameters effected by the Master Clock and how they change as the rate/tempo knobs are turned but remain synced to the Master Clock.

I picked a few that were requested more than once and will upload the files here, along with some rough YouTube videos that show how I use the sounds. Forgive my playing and the ""live"" sound quality. For some of these sounds, there may be samples needed to go along with the Programs. Most should be from the Nord Sample Library and some were found on this forum. I'll start with just the Programs and can go locate specific samples later as needed (or tell you where to find them). I was thinking about doing Bundles, though I'm using XL pianos for some of these sounds and the Bundles would be pretty large. I think most of you can get the idea of the sounds from just downloading the Programs.First isEvery Little Thing She Does Is Magic[BBvideo=425,350]<iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yz5ZhXZmmMY"" title=""YouTube video player"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"" allowfullscreen></iframe>[/BBvideo]",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=146373&sid=96d246e5b055961512eeee3e62212cd1#p146373

Otherwise it is a bright CP80 sound with an organ sound in the background. Hope it helps!,https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=170456&sid=96d246e5b055961512eeee3e62212cd1#p170456

Could you plz share the sounds/samples you use for ""Shut up and dance""Sure thing - I don't believe I have documented this on video, though I can add this to my list to show what I'm doing. For the intro and verse sections, I am mostly laying down an atmospheric pad using the Shut Up DancePad, which has the pad on the upper side of the split (filter sweep with control pedal) and a bright electric grand sound on the lower split, which I typically play the chord stabs during the chorus.For the signature solo, check out the Shut Up Lead 2, which has two fat synth lead sounds stacked together, with the control pedal controlling volume for one of them. Sometimes I will start with the single sound and swell in the second sound to build some energy.Hope this helps!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=173103&sid=96d246e5b055961512eeee3e62212cd1#p173103

This will produce more defined results than attempting velocity xfades using only your Nord's native tools.I do not fancy myself a hacker or computer programmer, so if I can do this, you can do it too. Shame on Clavia for not just telling us, since it took me all of 10 minutes to figure out. That said, I assume no risk for your poor choices, yadda yadda yadda. If you brick your computer or your Nord Stage by screwing with Sample Editor projects, that's on you.Now, I'm only going to say this once, so listen well, even though I know some of you won't listen: this procedure requires a Nord Sample Editor PROJECT. It must be as yet UNCOMPILED. IT WILL NOT WORK WITH FINISHED .NSMP3 FILES!!!! Presumably it will work with .nsmp and .nsmp4, but I've only tested it on the Stage 3, which is why I'm posting here. This hack is made possible by the quasi-human-readability of the Nord Sample Editor .nsmpproj files. In theory, if somebody with more knowledge could explain the .nsmpproj architecture, more developments into more customized sample patches could be made. There are MANY more parameters (such as one-shot mode, tuning per note independent of zone/sample tuning, dynamic EQ bands, and more) that are not accessible from the GUI of Nord Sample Editor. Some of these are probably used in creation of Nord Piano files. This suggests to me that there is a possibility of authoring a sample set with multiple velocity layers, but it is beyond my technical ability, and I fussed with Nord Sample Editor for a good 5 hours yesterday trying to make it happen. Today, I am here only for the task at hand: the level 1 sample velocity hack.Without further ado, here's how to cook up a 2-layer sample patch on a Nord Stage 3.1. Build your sample sets in Nord Sample Editor. If you want to remember which layer is which, you could do as I have done, appending p (piano) to one and f (forte) to the other. Save the projects, don't export yet.2. Determine the point of velocity split. In the provided example, I am splitting at 95/96.3. Open the .nsmpproj for both sample sets in your text editor of choice.4. In the p file, find and replace all instances of ""m_velocityMax = 127"" with the 127 changed to your chosen split low value. Save the file.5. In the f file, find and replace all instances of ""m_velocityMin = 0"" with the 0 changed to your chosen split high value. Save the file.6. Open Nord Sample Editor and transfer both sample sets to your NS3.7. Select (e.g.) panel A and load the p set to it. Repeat with panel B and the f set.8. Make any desired modifications to FX, amp / filter, etc.9. Save your program, et voilà: you have finally shunted your Nord's sample playback capability a shade closer to what italways should have been.NOTE: since the 2 sample layers are on two different panels, they will not use the same FX unless you copy them 1:1 between panels. You may choose to view this as a pain in the rear or as potential for very expressive sound design with (for example) delay throws or a longer reverb on your f layer.This process is fast and painless on the Stage 3. Experimentation could be rewarding, such as a timpani and piatti combo that only sound at high velocities layered with an orchestra patch. The implications for boards with 3 or more layers are vast. If you have a Stage 4 — lucky you, you could program the Kurzweil Triple Strike Grand if you wanted. A Wave 2? FOUR distinct layers.

This way you don't need to have multiple layers.Actually that was one of my first tests. Unfortunately as has been mentioned, NSE treats these as round robins. My NE6/NS3 will only play one of the samples, even if I have them occupying different velocity ranges.My suspicion is that the key to unlocking multiple velocities in a single file lies with the ""map"" class (… div? struct? param? var? I don't know what to call it) inside the NSE project file format. My best guess is that you can only have one sample (or set of samples all occupying the same velocity range if using NSL4.0-compatible boards) in a ""map."" You must therefore hack multiple ""maps"" into being within a NSE project file to get true multi-velocity sample playback. But the syntax of the NSE project file remains inscrutable to me. I do not have the brain for this.Funny trivia: I made a short 20-second video about this on TikTok and the Nord Keyboards account liked my video.Wish they had said something.

I'm looking to mimic as many Doors sounds as possible. I'm pretty new to the Nord world but, if I understand correctly, .ns3f files are stage piano program files, so they won't help. To my knowledge, I can't convert the program files either. I was wondering if you can give any advice about which patch to start with (or patches to mix) and which effects to apply. I'm planning to post something on the general forum too, but I noticed this thread and was hoping you guys might have some input too. There are several songs I am looking to mimic:For example, in Hello, I Love You, I think Rey Manzarek used a Gibson G101 with some kind of percussion and sustain setting on it. I am excited to try the patch Supertrampfanboi shared above (thank you!), but I'd still need an effect to get that buzz sound. Any ideas?Riders on the Storm is a Rhodes, obviously, but I think I hear tremolo and maybe a phaser in the original recording?Not to Touch the Earth: no idea what organ he used, nor how they got the weird psychedelic floaty, bendy sound. My hypothesis is that it is a Gibson G101 and they used the bend switch on the proprietary volume pedal those organs had. How could I mimic it?For Love Her Madly, Moonlight Drive, etc., Ray was playing a tack piano, which my NE6D has a near perfect sound for (labeled as a honkey tonk piano) for these Doors songs. It sounds just like it.I also has a Yamaha MODX8 and Yamaha has always had great default Vox Continental organ sounds for the Doors' early recordings, it's one thing that has kept me a Yamaha customer. My S80 had a perfect Vox and so does the MODX. Interestingly, it sounds more dead on to the Doors recordings compared to the NE6D.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=145775&sid=96d246e5b055961512eeee3e62212cd1#p145775

I did a quick tutorial search and didn’t find a matching scenario.I have a simple setup where my keyboard stereo audio routes directly into my laptop and I record the audio with Audacity. I bypass any unnecessary source of extraneous noise that might affect the quality of the sample. The Nord Sample Editor v4 will let you record directly from a source audio input into the app, however I prefer the flexibility of starting with a WAV file using Audacity and then just dragging the file into the sample editor with it assigning the keys to the notes sampled. Given you can add effects with your NE6D, it would be better to record your Yamaha without effects if possible (turn off reverb, chorus...) to give you more control of the final sound. If you have the ability to use USB from your mixer as the audio input to your laptop, that should work well, but in all cases (USB or audio mic/line input) you need to watch your levels so the audio doesn't clip. Let me know if you have other questions - if a lot of this is new to you, just let me know what you need clarification on.

Great video created by My Keys To Music that helped a bit in approaching this sampled version of the Who song. Note that using these samples requires that you play the song in the original key or the tempo will be wrong.The original recorded Lowrey was a bit sharp, so I took the Intro and dropped the pitch to be in tune to the piano for the first sample. Audacity and AVS4YOU should be able to change the pitch without changing the tempo, but neither did well with the very short duration samples (1/4 - 2 seconds) I used the first time. Based on the exchange below, I found out from Audacity that the latest version has a checkbox to indicate you want high quality sampling. If you have the same problem with changing the pitch of a sample, try the latest version of Audacity in high quality mode.The sample with the 32nd notes was created by cutting off the last half of each 16th note (C, D, F, G) and cut-n-pasting the first half again. I don't know the song yet but I play through a few notes on the MP3 so you get an idea of what you have.The bottom split has ""WhoBabaORileyFGW.nsmp3"" with the intro pattern on the F key and a pattern on the G key for when the song changes to a C chord. The middle split is the piano. The top split is the second sample ""WhoBabaORiley32W.nsmp3"" with the 32nd notes. It doesn't matter which sample memory locations you store new samples in your Nord Stage 3, just make sure that after you load the program, that you point the Slot A and Slot B Synth to the correct sample in your system. For example, if you load the ""WhoBabaORiley32W.nsmp3"" into your sample location 280 (287 in mine), then you just need to point Slot A to 280 rather than 287.UPDATE 4/6/19.

I had grabbed them a few weeks ago, but found that the proposed splits (piano in the middle) don't work on the ns3 compact since it doesn't have a high-F key like the ns3 76! So I put the 32 synth part between the FG synth and the piano. This also allows me to play the 32 synth with my left hand while playing the piano with my right rather than having to use my left hand for the piano part as you demonstrated (and doing a fuller chord on the piano since I can't hold the bass piano key as well).I took it a step further by pressing the ARP RUN key and then quickly hitting the low C key to get the automatic repeating 8th note that gets played when Roger sings ""We're all wasted"". I then copied this program to a second program where I replaced the 32 synth and piano parts with another synth where I used the ""Strings Quartet Solo Vib"" sample with sufficient mucking about in the Delay, and Amp sections so that while the FG synth is repeating the C key ad nauseam (while dropping the Decay to 288ms with the Arpeggiator set to 1/16T with ARP RUN and KB HOLD keys on), I can play the violin part through to the end and on the very last note simply press the KB HOLD key off to silence everything. I switch to this second program right after the last piano chord is played with the guitar ""solo"".  I hope this was clear. Try it.

Appreciate any insights.Yes, the piano is a little ""darker"" on the recording.  I think I used the Grand Lady D on this, which could be EQ'd a little, but you might want to see how it comes across playing live.  If your rig isn't going through the PA, you probably don't want to take any of the brightness off that will naturally happen with the room.The WAV files I posted could be used to create the ending by piecing together individual notes or you could record the riff using the 32nd notes sample and then create a new sample with it playing in a loop.  Attached is one for the C note playing just before the violin comes in.  The timing can be adjusted using Audacity or other audio editing software, or you could opt to play the note manually so the timing is easier to transition to which is slower than the intro.

If you set the left-hand sample ""WhoBabaORiley16W mono.nsmp"" (or ""WhoBabaORileyFGW.nsmp3"") on ""hold"" and play along with a click set for 118 BPM, you can periodically just hit the ""F"" note again to retrigger and line back up with the click as needed. The tempo changes toward the end before the violin solo. KeyBard provided a mp3hereif you want to listen to that transition.

The problem is that you need a single sample that will cover what I use at different ends of the keyboard on my Stage 3 with two samples. An option for you is to load ""WhoBabaORiley16W mono.nsmp"" and ""WhoBabaORiley32W.nsmp3"" into your NE6, and then use Nord Sample Editor 4 to create a NSMP3 file sampling the notes. With NSE4 you would have the option of putting both into a small range on the NE6 with the piano covering the other, or setting it up with the 16th notes at the low end and 32nd notes at the high end with the center section of the sample silent for the range covered by piano. You would be able to have the intro 16th notes continue to loop using the sustain pedal, but it would affect the piano as well, so no sustain on the piano might sound better.

Great video created by My Keys To Music that helped a bit in approaching this sampled version of the Who song. Note that using these samples requires that you play the song in the original key or the tempo will be wrong.The original recorded Lowrey was a bit sharp, so I took the Intro and dropped the pitch to be in tune to the piano for the first sample. Audacity and AVS4YOU should be able to change the pitch without changing the tempo, but neither did well with the very short duration samples (1/4 - 2 seconds) I used the first time. Based on the exchange below, I found out from Audacity that the latest version has a checkbox to indicate you want high quality sampling. If you have the same problem with changing the pitch of a sample, try the latest version of Audacity in high quality mode.The sample with the 32nd notes was created by cutting off the last half of each 16th note (C, D, F, G) and cut-n-pasting the first half again. I don't know the song yet but I play through a few notes on the MP3 so you get an idea of what you have.The bottom split has ""WhoBabaORileyFGW.nsmp3"" with the intro pattern on the F key and a pattern on the G key for when the song changes to a C chord. The middle split is the piano. The top split is the second sample ""WhoBabaORiley32W.nsmp3"" with the 32nd notes. It doesn't matter which sample memory locations you store new samples in your Nord Stage 3, just make sure that after you load the program, that you point the Slot A and Slot B Synth to the correct sample in your system. For example, if you load the ""WhoBabaORiley32W.nsmp3"" into your sample location 280 (287 in mine), then you just need to point Slot A to 280 rather than 287.UPDATE 4/6/19.

I think I tried this, but I am not sure that the missing items that the Sound Manager identified were correct to begin with. It seemed odd that the Shine On program was missing two ep samples, as it doesn’t make sense for the patch. I had those same samples loaded, but just a different size. Am I correct to assume that the Nord must be looking for certain samples/synths loaded in particular banks or slots?I really I guess need to know what samples/programs make up the patch.Does anyone have a working version of this they could open in Sound Manger and help to identify what is in the program?Thanks,Bill",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=120283&sid=602233ba4b90209c51452b57cdf6a376#p120283

So the fact that EP has a different size than the one in the program would be viewed as having a different name, correct? What is still unclear is why it would identify any electric piano as being missing from this particular patch. I mean, the sound doesn’t need an EP. Also when I reminded the first EP to the larger version it put a grand where it said if was missing another EP.

I'm unable to play the sound since it doesn't point out to the right samples or Synth sounds. Could someone help?Welcome to the Forum! Regarding the EPs noted above, the Nord Sound Manager will list sounds/samples that are missing even if they aren't actually used in the program.  If you don't have the EPs listed, you can download it from the Nord site or simply point to another just to get rid of the error.  For the sample, check which of two synth panels is set up to use a sample, and then relink it to the new NSMP3 sample you loaded either using your NS3 or using the Nord Sound Manager.  Check the synth levels - if they are morphed to the control pedal and you're not using one, the level will be at zero.When you start working with samples and want to start saving new ones, here are a few tips for Sound Manager:- View your current samples in ""organize"" mode to show open memory locations.- Sort samples from largest to smallest and delete the ones you don't need starting with the largest so you're freeing up the most space without losing as many samples.- Save all new samples to memory locations 250 and above so you always know which ones you loaded versus which ones came with your Stage 3.Below is a link to access over 70 programs I have put together for the Stage 3 that might be of help to you in the future.

So for me  it's on that short list of songs that really can't be done well live for 99% of bands.Your best bet would be to assemble an array of software modular synths on an iPad and get busy with programming.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=179059&sid=602233ba4b90209c51452b57cdf6a376#p179059

You'll find the the B3 sets back in the mix a little when played along with the piano, so I typically back off the piano and then adjust the synth level from there. Though settings vary quite a bit, for songs with a piano I will usually set the piano about -2db and then adjust the synth level to where it needs to be. For additional flexibility I typically ""morph"" the synth Level to my Control Pedal so I can fade in parts easily.

They're fairly simple but still distinctive.  Your question did make me think about the old Prophet 5 programming.

For my program, the synth uses Wave 1 ""Mix Triangle - Second"" with a triangle wave mixed in 2 octaves higher.  Unison mode is set to 1 and chorus is added as well.  If you're trying to recreate this with a E5D, absent finding a sample to get close (check the samples section of this forum) you could try using the B3 organ 8' and 2' stops (adding a little of the 1' stop perhaps), but route it through the chorus effect (slow) rather than the Leslie.

This has nothing to do with the instrument's split functionality - it's just up to your phantasy. It's to be done via Nord Sample Editor. And you will need to balance the volume of both beforehand.BTW: Nord have been famous for their organ engine; they still are famous for their piano samples.

The Prophet Rev2 has layering and I assume one sound can be in mono voice (unison) and the other polyphonic, but not sure if the mono voice will track the highest note played in a chord - it sounds like it to me.  The old Prophets would track the high note that way and I'd love it if the Nords could be capable of tracking like that when in mono voice, at least as an option. On my Prophet 10, I could combine the upper and lower synths with one being in mono with glide, which added a bit of flexibility in playing - it's one of the first things I looked for when I got my first Stage.  What I'm hearing is a dominant top note with glide and the other notes with a similar polyphonic sound. I tried a split with two synths on the NS3 last night, one for mono part, and covering the filters and volume with the mod wheel. It's a little harder to play with the split than being able to play with both hands like in the video and just have the high note tracked - this at least might get you started.Update:The program was revised 9/22/2018 to add the mod wheel also covering the drop in pitch which required using OSC2 for the primary voice.Update2:As Nick starts to ""open"" the filter (turn up the Freq) more as the song picks up, the program was revised 9/25/2018 with the filter applied to the Control Pedal (rather than volume). I also added two additional programs that achieve the same sound but each accommodates a different playing technique as follows:""NS TradeItAll W.ns3f"" is the same as previously posted but with the filter applied to the Control Pedal for when the song picks up.""NS TradeItAll2 W.ns3f"" swaps the Control Pedal and Mod Wheel functions. The Control Pedal is used all the way up, and then backed off quickly to pull the pitch down and ""open"" the filter.""NS TradeItAll3 W.ns3f"" is the same as 2 but with left and right hand sounds swapped.Take care.NS TradeItAll  W.mp3NS TradeItAll  W.ns3fNS3 Program for Nick Semrad on Trade It All - soft synth - mono voice split left, polyphonic voices split right, with Mod Wheel covering filter and drop in pitch, and Control Pedal for filter only(574 Bytes) Downloaded 2025 timesNS TradeItAll2 W.ns3fNS3 Program for Nick Semrad on Trade It All - soft synth - mono voice split left, polyphonic voices split right, with Control Pedal covering filter and drop in pitch, and Mod Wheel for filter only(574 Bytes) Downloaded 1950 timesNS TradeItAll3 W.ns3fNS3 Program for Nick Semrad on Trade It All - soft synth - polyphonic voices split left, mono voice split right, with Control Pedal covering filter and drop in pitch, and Mod Wheel for filter only(574 Bytes) Downloaded 1972 times",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=106971&sid=602233ba4b90209c51452b57cdf6a376#p106971

Below are the steps you can follow to program it. Good luck!Load program ""NS TradeItAll2 W.ns3f"" from above and for both Slot A and Slot B:a) Hold down the CTRLPED button under MORPH ASSIGN and turn the synth FREQ knob until the OLED panel indicates TO: ""none"", meaning the Control Pedal will not adjust the Freq value.b) Release the CTRLPED button and then set FREQ to 147 Hz (or to what sounds good to you).c) For MOD ENV set the ATTACK to 3, a typical setting for ""brass synth"" sounds, the setting determines how long it takes for the envelope filter to ramp up from the FREQ setting to the upper bound set for MODULATION MOD ENV.d) For AMP ENV set the ATTACK to 0.e) Save the program with a different name (or you can rename it using Sound Manager).That's it. To play, back off the Control Pedal a little from its max setting (lowering the pitch of OSC2) and then play the chord while increasing the Control Pedal to max to bring the sound up to the correct pitch. The Mod Wheel morph is already set to turn the FREQ up more if needed.  I hope this helps you learn a little bit more about the NS3.

I approached it with a split having my left hand do the pads and arpeggio, all of which I did with samples, so they are triggered with single keys.  The right hand is dedicated to the Moog-like lead line (sounds like a French Horn), which is Gm pentatonic noodling.I have a Stage 3-88, so the key assignments reflect that.Left hand is used to trigger these samples.C1 is the drone on G (it's the Shine On drone from another user)-Sting sings-D1 and Eb1 are hit at the same time.  There are the arpeggio and the Gm chord pad.-Sting sings-Gb1 is the Gm7/Ab chord pad-Sting sings-A1 is the Ebmaj7 chord pad-Sting sings-Return to Eb1 Gm).-Drummer starts-B1 is the first glissando padC2 is the second glissando pad.Right hand is used to do the lead line.2) is after the song starts.

I don't use them that much for covers (except some D50 sounds) but fun to have and to play with (can lead to very interesting experimental sounds).All the programs for my cover band are homemade, generally using resources found here (those are the same found much more organised in the NUS) as a start. I always end up tweaking those programs to my own tasteThing is : depending on your band setup, you will need different programs configuration (remove brass sound cause you have a horn section, no bass as the bassist doesn't want to have another layer). So there is not a ""standard"" program for a covered song.If you're using 2 keyboards, then you may need to reconfigure which sounds plays with which keyboards and in the end, for i.e., may not use this synth lead sound on the upper split section in the Nord program (BTW, that is the most time-consuming sound to create).Also, some of the songs I play are covers of coversTherefore, the original ""Wurly killer patch with phaser"" is of no use.Then, out of the 200 programs in the package, you'll need only say 80, the rest is unused for the money... and you'll need in many cases to go back to programming for tweaking.Stage are so easy to program. Importing samples or creating your own sample is also a piece of cake with NSE v4.And again, the community here is sharing so many programs and so reactive to share samples/programs upon requests that I never felt the need to go to commercial banks !I'd like to mention the quality of the Nord (and other brands) sounds from NarfSounds.

I personally have it installed in my own Nord Stage 3 and the more I use it the more braver I became to modify the sounds to my personal taste.  I also have downloaded some samples from the Forum as well.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=160274&sid=602233ba4b90209c51452b57cdf6a376#p160274

Compared to what other creators are charging for a fraction of the songs, it's well worth $80. Quite a few are very accurate. You Can Call Me Al comes to mind. My only beef is I wish there were instructions for EACH patch that explained what each part of the program are intended for, meaning, I want to know exactly how he uses each patch in each song for those of us who can't piece it together for the not so obvious ones. Sometimes there's some guess work especially when some of the parts don't match anything in the original song. Most are self explanatory. Would love it if there was a simple video example of every patch that just shows the songs broken up into the sections that are played. The YouTube videos just skim over it from what I can tell.

It's far from perfect, though it works well live.I hadn't thought of sampling the giggle at the beginning...good idea!I'm only using one program for this song with the arp on one panel and the phased pad on the other panel, with control pedal morph for volume swells. I change my layered Hammond drawbar setting within the same program. Clearly Nick Rhodes didn't use a Hammond, LOL...it just fattens it up for me and works well live.If you wanted to have the giggle, plus the arp, plus two different synth sounds for verse and chorus, that's four different things. That won't fit into one program with the limitation of two synth panels, unless you create some custom samples where, for example, you have the giggle assigned to the lowest key with two other verse/chorus sounds sampled into zones above that (catching three sounds on one synth panel). Then you'd have the other synth panel free for the arpeggiator thing. That's a bit of work, though it would be possible. Another option would be using two programs and splitting things between those. With seamless transition and song mode, it makes that sort of thing pretty smooth on the NS3.Good luck if you work on this and please share your results!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=174949&sid=602233ba4b90209c51452b57cdf6a376#p174949

As the first version used just one Synth panel, it was easy to add a split to have the other synth available to hold a note during the chorus of the song. More notes may be played, but I set this up to put the synth on ""hold"" to play a high ""C"" note while the other part is played.  The MP3 covers the intro and then the second part that includes the other synth.  If you have already downloaded the program above or the one miloreason83 posted of mine and don't want to go through the trouble of downloading this, the setup is fairly easy as both already have the second synth programmed and fairly close to what you may want - the split just needs to be set up (top right, last few notes) and the synths assigned.

""VH Jump V3a    W.ns3f"" the same as my original for Panel A synth, and I added the Panel B synth to mix in just a little different attack to the beginning of the sound. ""VH Jump V3b    W.ns3f"" is the second program for the song with the Panel A synth on the left hand shifted a couple octaves and the Panel B synth providing the strings for the song. My earlier posthereworks well as a third program if you want to have the high C note on strings on hold while playing the Panel A synth with both hands.For other Nord users that use samples, I've also attached NSMP files that have the doubled-up synths for the intro and strings on the high end. Using octave shifting you can play the main part as loaded and then shift it up a couple octaves to have the strings on the right hand.  To make the sample, I used my Panel A synth for Jump and added the ""Final Brass Motif.nsmp3"" sample from Ivan Jochner in Panel B to add a little more punch. If interested, the sample is available with his post atnord-stage-3-programs-ns3p-ns3pb-files- ... ml#p106093.  Ivan's sample is fairly small and can easily be added in place of what I have for Panel B in ""VH Jump V3a.ns3f"", but my preference above was to create a ""Jump"" program that didn't require loading a sample - your choice.Two NSMP files are provided below. one covering synth and strings and a smaller without the strings so the second panel could be used to accent the primary synth. The note samples are long/looped, hence the file sizes.

By Donnie Iris. There is a synth patch that hits pretty hard at about 1:35 on the original recording found at YouTube. Can anyone advise what that might have been? I've searched around Google and YouTube and there isn't much of anything of use on this one. It's kind of an obscure one hit wonder but it's catchy for sure. Thanks for any input.

So there never can be a correct normalisation in loudness, and Nord even didn't try to get closer to it.I started by setting pianos to -2 dB but never got the right relation between them and a lot of other sounds.

The acoustic gives a natural body, while the digital gives a really nice sparkle and brightness. It will overall sound less static, as there are slight differences in tuning between the samples (also try with Grand + Upright or any other combo). Tasteful chorus, delay, compression, (EQ) and reverb on both pianos. For maximum effect, use different chorus and delay settings on them. I use this piano sound exclusively on stage, for all songs.But some songs require something a bit extra, like in this case. Then I just add a synth layer. For example on ""The Best"" (Tina Turner) I've layered it with the D50 sample that also appears on the original studio version. I also have one version with some strings added to fill up the sound. This is what the Stage 3 excels at.Now for this exact song: I hear a lot of octaves on the piano. Not sure how it was achieved in the studio, but that's what gibes it the brightness. 2 alternatives on the Stage 3:A: just change the octave range on one of the pianos. Might get you close enough with the brightness, but will take away from the fullness (because the piano layers aren't working in the same register anymore). Wether that's a bad thing or not.B: add synth layer(s) with up-octaved oscillators (or an alternative method), to achieve that sense of ""brightness or something else"".You're probably best off adding synth layers anyway.Just look for the right balance between octaves and fullness and punchiness all those cool words.And the synth programs that you layer on the pianos don't need to be anything crazy. They just need to blend in with the piano, if (like in this case) all that's needed is ""brightness or something else"". So often fast attack is a good thing, maybe cut out the bottom (so it's not competing with the piano. Find the healthy amount unison/detune/thickness.If the stars align, I'll upload the programs here that I talked about but for the mean time just try it out.

On the Stage 3, set the MODULATION Mod Env to 10, and Freq starting around 2, to set the range of the sweep you want.  Try a classic sawtooth wave (try unison=1) for your sound and a pulse (square) wave on the LFO for the note iteration.

This program has a clean Strat sample from my post atnord-user-samples-nsmp-samples-f14/bass ... 21417.htmlwith compression, a Clavinet with EQ for a little low end ""bass"", and a distorted ""Les Paul Neck-mic"" sample on the right with harmonic on AfterTouch, vibrato on Mod Wheel, and Wah morphed to the control pedal.

Starting with the program below I placed a B3/Leslie and clean Strat with Tremolo/Chorus left of the split, and solo guitar with harmonic feedback right of the split. The harmonic is added using OSC2 and mixed with OSC1 using aftertouch. This program uses the new Nord Strat sample""E Guitar S 62_ST Stereo 3.0.nsmp3"" (included below), but if you want to save sample space (>4MB), the small Stratocaster sample below or others you may already have could be used instead. On the mp3 the B3 and Strat are both held with the sustain pedal so the left hand is free for the pitch bar, mod wheel, and Leslie slow/fast. The B3 volume is on the control pedal.  The solo guitar uses the stock ""Les Paul Neck-mic"" sample, but you can try out others to your taste.

A few use Nord NSMP3 samples that aren't yet in the NSMP4 library, but ""EGuitar S62"" is available and perhaps ""Blues Guitar"" can be used in place of the Les Paul. Most of the samples I used are ""clean"" and are modified by the distortion and effects settings of the NS3, which should be easy to mirror on the NS4.

I'm not sure how it will sound trying this option, but worth checking out. If you listen closely to the original solo, Bernie's synth is in monophonic with the glide prominent, and then mono is switched off and chords are played, and then mono is switched back on.

But that's what the Nord family is all about: having the means to create your own sounds and trying new samples from time to time.Whereas you will find older OS versions by manipulating the last figures of the download address, I don't think that it works the same way with factory bundles. But you may ask the Nord support.BTW: Do you remember the name of the program missing? Names rule in that case, not numbers.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=169244&sid=a1586ee0fc546621ec3e580ddfffbc4f#p169244

I can play a show with only a sustain pedal + a control pedal added to that. In the future I intend to use Mainstage for 2 main functions: A talkbox and sidechain. Sidechain requires routing outputs 1-2 of the S3 through Mainstage, with a kick mic signal pumping it when needed. The talk box is a completely different story (which I'm happy to share), but that is completely handled in mainstage apart from S3 Extern controlling it.I have thefull repertoireon Spotify (almost 4 hours), but I decided to remove unnecessary songs from this list. This includes songs that just use basic (but good) piano or B3 programs. I have 4 different grand piano patches, with various levels of padding on top of the Silver Grand XL (my only grand piano sample). I have 4 B3 programs with increasing amounts of overdrive (and a solo volume on panel B), so I avoid making 23 redundant B3 programs.I play in a 5 piece band, with 1 guitar, 2 keys (me being one of them), bass and drums. My fellow keyboardist mainly plays piano, and occasionally some EP. This leaves me with lots ofdoing whatever the hell I want. YAY!My strategy in programs levels might seem weird to you, I try to keep the average volume low, so I have lots of headroom for solo sounds. I generally keep my programs even in volume, but store small adjustments beforehand to aid whoever is in charge of mixing our band.Here are the songs:I colour coded the ones that don't have their own Song, but are instead grouped into one Song with others on the instrument.All Night Long - Lionel RichieAll Night Long-04-2022.mp3Africa - Toto[/color]Africa-04-2022.mp3Animal Spirits - Vulfpeck-  (a very funktional synth with optionally a Talkbox)The Best - Tina Turner-  (uses a killer D-50 sample, credit to whoever shared it here)The Best-04-2022.mp3Breakthrough - Queen-  (tailored B3 for our pianist because I'm singing)Careless Whisper - George Michael-  (I wish there was a cheese ""smilie"" available)Careless Whisper-04-2022.mp3Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic - The Police-  (arrangement is much like in ""Live in Buenos Aires"" version. my part is B3-piano combo, and I love it!)Every Little Thing-04-2022.mp3Get Lucky-  (piano-EP blend + lead)Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!-  (I have alternative programs for this. I like a simple (string)pad+lead combo with CtrlPed controlling the lead volume)Higher Ground-  (flashy clavinet)Hold The LineHot N Cold - Katie Perry-  (can be bland without the sidechain in Mainstage, but can be pumped with CtrlPed)Isn't She LovelyI Wish - Stevie Wonder-  (rhodes + hybrid brass)Jump - Van Halen-  (normal + solo program, solo with a CtrlPed bonus for added effect)Kung för en dag - Magnus Uggla-  (no one will ever need this)Let's Go Crazy-  (s slappier Farfisa with some sprinkles)The Power Of Love - Huey Lewis & The News-  (B3 - synth split)Purple RainRosanna-  (piano + solo synth)Seven Days - Stings*x On Fire - Kings of Leon-  (apparently the platform will automatically censor some words)Shut Up And Dance - WALK THE MOON-  (Also benefits from sidechain)SledgehammerSledgehammer-04-2022.mp3Superstition-  (flashy clavinet)Thriller-  (2 programs, split synth bass on left side in bothoutput 3, plays through bass amp)Uptown FunkYou Can Call Me Al - Paul SimonYou Can Call Me Al-04-2022.mp3Link to files in Google DriveI tried to make this as readable as possible.

Use this for the chord progressions with the left hand and when you get to the parts of the song where she sings ""both of us knowing"" and the pitch goes wonky, I set it up for aftertouch to give vibrato for the wonky sound, and then use the pitch bend knob to bend it down an octave as you release the note. It will give a similar effect to that in the song.The upper split (panel B) I just used the electric piano section (EP4 Mk5 80s) and used the EQ to dial down the treble a bit for a more muted and less bright piano like what I hear on the record.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=169044&sid=a1586ee0fc546621ec3e580ddfffbc4f#p169044

To use with my Stage 3 program ""Styx2MuchTime1 W.ns3f"" above you will need to point the synth to the new sample loaded.  The clock ticking is pitched with actual seconds on D7, but playing Db7 will slow it down a little, and it's looped in case you hold out that section of the song a little longer.

An example starts at time 0:15 in this:In addition to the NS3 piano options, I have Spectrasonics KeyScape and Ivory 2, so I think I probably have the necessary raw materials. I quite like that sound and would like to have it as an available preset for impromptu melodies. Any hints at types of reverb or other processing that makes it ring like that?Thanks,Mark",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=168193&sid=a1586ee0fc546621ec3e580ddfffbc4f#p168193

I played around with this some and and had an enjoyable evening. The ""two piano"" hint seemed to be a key part in creating the target sound. I combined the white grand and the lady d on the NS3. I did add a bit of synth/pad with a medium-ish amplitude delay. And a little bit of most of the on-board effects (pan, chorus, delay, reverb). I also added a bit more reverb with an external pedal. Playing the melody line along with one of those 7and5 songs sounds pretty similar. To my ear, you were pretty much spot on with your ideas.

The intro synth should be played a little differently than on the MP3 I recorded: with my right hand I'm simply holding the low A note with my thumb while triggering the higher notes, whereas on the record the low A is played and released like the other notes. It will sound even better if you play it that way.  The solo synth for the middle has a quick slap-back echo, a little amplifier distortion, and other settings to fatten it up a little - I can't wait to try through my regular setup.

I didn't think that could happen but not sure... Just in case, I added the synth section programs used if you want to load those and link each to the appropriate program.  ""StyxFoolinYrslf1.ns3y"" is the lead synth I used for ""StyxFoolnYrslf1W.ns3f"" and ""StyxFoolnYrslf2W.ns3f"", and ""StyxFoolinYrslf3.ns3y"" is the lead synth I used for ""StyxFoolnYrslf3W.ns3f"".A couple other things, I use a Control Pedal for certain volume levels, and I use a piano to reinforce a bass note in the intro that you might not have.

If you want to try it with the program you created, here's a link to a program for Crazy Dream by Tom Misch that is set up for it on one of the synths.

I have updated to the latest OS and this hasn't helped.Sometimes the volume of the organ engine comes back to where it should be (by its own accord) after playing for a few minutes, but then also randomly reduces volume.The other engines are providing output fine and I've swapped headphones to isolate the issue specifically to the organ engine alone.It is definitely a problem with the output of the organ engine in my NS3. It is nothing to do with settings (as I've previously successfully saved lots of programs and songs, but now they no longer work properly because of the organ engine issue).I have also reverted back to basics just turning on the organ engine in isolation (with piano engine and synth engines switched off) and ensuring any pedals are not connected. I've also cycled through the factory organ presets. However, the problem still remains throughout and the Farfisa model doesn't appear to be giving any sound output.I have had my NS3 Compact from new and had Electro 5d and Electro 4D before, so I am well versed in Nord architecture and I'm confident that this is not a ""user error"" in relation to any saved settings.Any suggestions or experience of how to fix this issue would be greatly appreciated.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=165201&sid=ed0a221fa89e5267557fc94bf0933478#p165201

While it is easy to take isolated tracks and create samples and then map them onto keys, I have taken the time to listen and try to recreate without using cut and paste samples. So far so good with main bass riff, pan flutes, electric staccato/gated keys, and distorted phased guitar. I'm now trying to recreate the solo synth sound from a live version (Nine Inch Nails - Closer (Live: Beside You in Time - Unedited)) that starts at 2:49. I can hear a chirpy steel drumish sound with a bit of white noise. Not sure how to recreate without any samples by using just the synth, piano, and organ sections (or any combination of those). I'm open to any and all suggestions.Maybe start with an electric piano to cover the steel drum aspect, add a bit of autowah for chirp, and perhaps some distorion to get noise? Didn't get me there, though I can hear some bits that are.Thank in advance to any responders.Best,Rackmount",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=164977&sid=ed0a221fa89e5267557fc94bf0933478#p164977

Obviously the tool wouldn't be able to replicate the programs fully because the keyboard functionality is so different... but I think the following would be incredibly useful, and probably straightforward for someone with the right skills? My idea is:- Export my existing custom programs (in my case approx 40 of them on NS2)- The tool:-- Creates a new program for each (for either NS3 or NS4), with the correct name-- Assigns the correct sounds and samples to the slots / sections-- Does one or two basics that are common across boards, e.g. sets split points, volume- Import the new Programs to the new keyboardIt would save hours just from creating the basic names programs with the right sounds assigned.  From there I can sort out effects, or improve with all the new features like piano dynamics etc.What do you think? Is it doable?

Somehow some songs get by that I haven't heard over the years until brought up like this one. What a great Rhodes solo in this song!

When organ tones get high enough, they start to sound thinner, and it becomes less critical to use the exact same drawbar settings that the player used in the recording you are listening to. I would start with 888888888, then play the top pitch alone, to see if it sounds reasonable or if you need to reduce certain drawbar settings. Then figure out what the next lowest note needs to be, play test those 'second notes' along with the 'top notes' and see if you need to modify the drawbar settings then, and continue.There is probably some chorus or vibrato in there too. You can add that either on an Electro or Stage.This organ part is not the main thing - it is a decoration. If you get the top two sounds of the chord right, with the right tone (drawbar and chorus settings), it will probably sound right in a band context, because the rhythm guitar and bass parts are much more prominent and important.Regarding the top note of the chord, for a lot of time in this song I hear a lot of the note ""G"": For example, for most of the time from 1:57-2:08 the ""G"" is most prominent at the top of the chord, and you can hear where it occasionally dips down to F#. The same is true earlier in the song, from 0:50-1:17. And then from 1:17-1:18 the organ sound gets richer - maybe an extra note below the others was added to the chord, or maybe the organ play added some volume via the control pedal?Part of what you will need to do will depend on how your band's guitarist plays. If they use an acoustic and play it similar to what you see in this video, that will leave space for you to play those sustained organ notes at a relatively high pitch, which you hear in this video. In the video, those two chord playing instruments did not step on each other's sound space - you can hear both, even with the organ part being soft. If your guitarist plays on electric instead of acoustic, that might change things, and if your guitarist starts playing higher chord voicings or most sustained notes, that could change things too.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=162965&sid=ed0a221fa89e5267557fc94bf0933478#p162965

Is there already a manual in the forum ?At this link you can download the Nord Sample Editor 4 application and read their online guide: websitehttps://www.nordkeyboards.com/software- ... e-editor-4To create the separate sounds you need,- open the NSE4 software,- either a) load the original clip (saved as a WAV file) into NSE4 (drag-n-drop directly to a key also works well in this case), or b) record the sound directly into your laptop from your Electro 6,- copy the clip to the keys you want,- modify the start and stop time of the clip used for each key to have one key cover just the ""BD"" and the other cover the ""Snare+Claps"",- set the keyboard range you want for each sound and set the key samples as ""unpitched"".  For example, if you assigned BD to key C3 and the Snare+Claps to D3, the actual range of the BD sound can be all notes below C3 and C#3, and the range for the Snare+Claps could be D3 and above.  ""Unpitched"" is needed otherwise the sound on will be interpolated and sound like a recording being slowed down or sped up depending on whether below or above the root key used.As there's more to creating a sample than just the basic steps above, I'd suggest reading the online guide first to help fill in the blanks.

Having tried every available clonewheel on the market, I never had one that sounded better in a full rock band mix. I thoroughly tested Crumar Mojo, Viscount Legend, HX3, Hammond XK1c but none of them made me happy.My old Stage 2 EX, then my Electro 6D and currently my Stage 3 all made the FOH guys happy, commenting on how great they sounded through different PA systems.So these are the settings with some comments:EQ:- Treble +10.0 dB- Mid Freq 306 Hz- Mid +5.0 dB- Bass +5.0 dB=> That’s giving the B3 lots of treble to increase perceived overdrive and key click as well as some oomph in the lower mids- Drive (EQ Section): 3.0- Hammond Section Vol: -10.1=> The EQ increases the loudness so I had to tone down volume and use the EQ section drive for compensating the lack of distortion. Otherwise it’s hard to balance the B3 with other sounds.- Compressor: 5.0Hammond Sound Settings:- Tonewheel Mode: Vintage 2- Click Level: High- Rotary Speaker Type: 122- Rotary Balance: Bass/Horn 40/60- Rotary Rotor Speed: Low- Rotary Horn Speed: Low=> Yes, I’m not using the 122 Close like most people do. With the high amount of treble, the „throb“ (amplitude modulation) is just too much through a big PA. Also, am I the only one noticing that the 122 Close setting takes away all the presence in the higher mids?In addition, a citation from maestro Jon Lord about Chorus/Vibrato: „C1 - only one I ever use.“",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=159195&sid=ed0a221fa89e5267557fc94bf0933478#p159195

I haven't played around with the synth for this one, but I hit the ""easy button"" and sampled it for you.  The sample is looped - you can put the synth on hold to play it as long as you would like. The sample is unpitched so it can be played across any zone you assign. If you play the song in a different key, you would need to change the pitch of the original synth pattern (attached) with software like Audacity so that the sample retains the tempo of the original sample. After making your new WAV file, you would load the WAV file into the Nord Sample Editor 4 to create a new sample.

I set the wheel to reduce the organ volume to zero and the piano volume to 100% when the wheel is pushed all the way up, and of course back to 100% for the organ and zero for the piano when it is pushed all the way back. Now I see that sometimes when I push the wheel all the way up or down, it doesn't go to 100% or zero, the last LED (the one for 100% and the one for zero respectively) stays dark. When I move the wheel up and down again, all the LEDs light up again, as they should.At the moment I'm not worried about this because it's barely audible, but I'm wondering if this is the start of a potential bigger problem. Has anyone here noticed the same behaviour from the wheel and is there anything that can be done to fix it?",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=160403&sid=5617b7035cf5ca468d840a12a93b8aff#p160403

For the Slot A synth I used Wave 8 (""Wave Organ #1"") and for the Slot B synth I used a triangle wave to fatten up the sound a little. For both synths the LFOs are set with the square wave and synced to the clock, the control pedal covers the Wah effect, and EQ is used to pull out some of the midrange. Try it out with your keyboard set up across the range of the control pedal and adjust the midrange EQ as needed to make sure there isn't a frequency range coming through too strong compared to the rest.

The high triangle would sound closer to the original using one panel for just that (perhaps using the 4MB sample from the post above) with appropriate LFO/Ring Mod effect, and using the other panel for the strings with a longer release, but the bass synth would have to be covered by another program or keyboard. The second program below is an option without the bass, with Piano/Strings on left and high Synth/Strings on the right. Hopefully these programs can get you started whatever direction you choose to take.

To use this some manual changes are needed throughout the song. In the MP3 for the first program, the White Grand and strings start out the intro, I then manually select MONO mode for the Panel A synth and use the Mod Wheel (""MW"") to turn up the synth ""flute"" on OSC2 and back out the piano, and then turn off MONO mode and back off the MW to get back to the piano/strings.  A B3 is set up if you'd like more emphasis in the middle section. NOTE: You can adjust the MW morph on OSC2 to blend in more strings if you want it to sound like the MP3 for ""Abba Gimme x 3 W.ns3f"" above.Note:Synth bass updated and chorus on MW morphed to ""flute""/strings in Dec 2022.ABBA GmeGmeGme W.ns3fStage 3 Program for ""Gimme Gimme Gimme"" by ABBA - Bass Synth, Piano, B3 and High Synth/Strings(592 Bytes) Downloaded 419 timesStage 3 - ABBA Gimme Gimme Gimme no sample.mp3For the second program, I loaded the sample provided by Funk76 in place of the Panel B bass synth and kept the strings in Panel A but without OSC2.  In the MP3 for the second program, the White Grand and strings start out the intro, the MW is then used to turn up the Sample and back out the piano, and then the MW is backed off to return to the piano/strings combo and I added the B3.  For both programs the control pedal is set up to change the level of the B3 and Panel A Synth. Don't forget to load the sample below if you choose to go that route.

It's a little different than layering two completed sounds, like layering the Panel A synth over the Panel B synth that can have completely different characteristics and effects applied.  Though the choice of OSC2 sources is different than OSC1, OSC2 adds a great deal of flexibility to the synth including the capability to affect the waveform of OSC1.

Im using nord electro 6Hello, below is a NSMP file made by sampling each of the notes from my program. As the file is very big, I've also attached the two WAV files I used for Synth A and Synth B so you can make your own NSMP if you want it smaller. My file is large because I used samples for all notes across 2 octaves on the lower section and only skipped every other note on the upper section.  With sounds that have have a timed aspect to them, like the slide pitch change for Synth A,  you pretty much want each note to have the same characteristic, so that means more actual samples used, whereas for sounds like the one used for Synth B, you can skip more notes with interpolation working pretty well. Other ways to make the NSMP file smaller is only use the samples for the notes you will actually play in the song and let the rest be interpolated, and you can cut the file size in half by converting it to a mono (rather than stereo) file.  I hope this helps. Take care.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=140666&sid=5617b7035cf5ca468d840a12a93b8aff#p140666

I would take the route of preparing a bundle or full backup file just in case you find that the other Stage 3 is not 100% original.

And a fast LFO modulating the filter, giving it that rough edge.Hard to tell from a fast listen on laptop speakers, but it's possible it's the same LFO applied to the pad's oscillator pitches giving them that detuned effect.This is the kind of stuff the Memorymoog is exceptionally good for, except that's not as precise-sounding and more ""woah"", like all things Memorymoog.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=156056&sid=a1299f703f04239b80fc58da9bcf9b74#p156056

Watching a great video on the making of the album ""Aja"", I came across a section where some (not all) of Michael McDonald's vocals were isolated for ""Peg"". Starting with those vocals, I blended in some backing vocals from the free demo of the chorus at Karaoke Version (https://www.karaoke-version.com) to complete the ending phrases. The samples provided in NSMP format:""Steely Dan - Peg W.nsmp"" has the backing vocals on the low E1, F1, and F#1 keys and a modified sax to emulate the Lyricon. The vocals are down in the mix in case you want to use them to supplement your band's vocals.""SD Peg Lyricon.nsmp"" has just the Lyricon without the backing vocals if you would prefer to use that and save some sample space. For both samples, the notes for the Lyricon are set up with an octave shift down at Bb1 so that the higher intro notes on the Clavinet have the correct accompanying Lyricon notes (listen for it on the intro).""Clavinet S.nsmp"" is a very small (198K) Clavinet sample made just for this song (you can try other Clavinet samples as well); it's manually turned off during the verses and chorus.The program has a Rhodes with Phase Shifter and Clavinet with Flanger (effect amount morphed to the Mod Wheel) that are panned slightly left-right and can be backed off with the Control Pedal to get a good balance with the Lyricon/vocals.  To make the attached MP3, I went to Karaoke Version and made a backing track for $2.99 U.S. with the bass, drums, and guitar; I'm really impressed with the quality of what's available at the site.  For those of you who transpose your keyboard down a half step, I've attached pitch-corrected samples that will split correctly with the keyboard transposed -1.

I know they take a lot of work.Sorry you're having trouble with setting this up. Using Nord Sound Manager, you would load ""Steely Dan - Peg W.nsmp"" and ""Clavinet S.nsmp"" first, and then load the program ""Steely Dan Peg W.ns3f"".  In that order the program would find the two samples needed for the program and have the backing vocals on the low E1, F1, and F#1 keys.  I play the chords to the song with my right hand while I play the intro clavinet/Lyricon with my left.  The clavinet sample is only used for the intro and just before the guitar solo, and manually turned off during the verses and chorus. I use a control pedal for some of the levels; if you don't have one you would need to disable the morphs for that. With the samples already loaded, try reloading the program and see if everything sets up as described.  Let me know how it turns out - good luck!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=155125&sid=a1299f703f04239b80fc58da9bcf9b74#p155125

Your English writing is good (so don't worry), but I will try to use simple English.These songs are full of unique sounds. This can be hard to do before meeting up and planning the band arrangement, because many sounds could be done with a guitar or vocals instead of your Stage 3. When you know for example: ""I want to play a growling lead here,"" or ""Here I need to play a calm pad"", then you can try to make that specific sound.Most of these songs have not been discussed here before, but there are a couple of threads discussingBliss, which you can find by searching ""Bliss Muse"". If you find a Stage 2 program, load it up to our beloved file viewer app (link below in my signature), and copy it on your Stage 3. (Love and respect to the creators!)Remember: you will use this instrument to create art, not to just copy a certain sound. If you make programs and samples yourself, they might become much better.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=153292&sid=a1299f703f04239b80fc58da9bcf9b74#p153292

Very nice video and program, I like the morphing you did on OSC2 for the effect as well. My program used 2 guitars but for different parts, so the panel set aside for the left split could be assigned to the bass.  In case you want to try it, here's your program with the right distorted guitar added. I brightened it up a little with Freq and EQ, added the Wah effect on the control pedal, set AfterTouch for the high harmonic, and then put in the settings you wanted of having it in Mono with AMP Release set to 588ms. The Mod Wheel will add vibrato - another option would be to swap the high harmonic to be on the MW and Vibrato on AfterTouch (just my preference not to put them together on one control). After loading you'll need to reassign your piano to the program as I didn't have the same one loaded in my Stage 3.

It would be great to hear you cover the JS song with the new program whenever you have the time.For your bass and guitar sample, making your own with the Nord Sample Editor 4 might be your best bet for having the notes you want where you want them. Based on the modified Les Paul sound, I posted a new program with a clean Strat with chorus on the left and a Clavinet added just for a little low end in the first octave like your program if you want to try it out as-is or using the clean Les Paul sample.  I wish Nord made a simple bass sample for the Piano section, but using the Clavinet works OK layering it over the Stratocaster.LINK -->nord-stage-3-programs-ns3p-ns3pb-files- ... ml#p150248Regarding the bug you noted, I don't use distortion a lot but haven't ever had a problem with it cutting out. It's possible that the circuit board connection or pot might be the problem (do the EQ settings drop too?).  If it happens again, check to see if the ""E"" (edit) shows up on the program display (assuming you haven't already changed a parameter); if so, the setting could be erroneously changing due to the problem I noted and toggling between programs loads the default settings again.

And merely toggling these settings (without switching to another program and back) does not correct the problem. Also after it has occurred (and before I correct it by switching programs), I try switching the Oscillators between SAMP, CLASSIC, WAVE, FORMANT, and SUPER. There is NO SOUND on 2 or 3 of those, including WAVE and FORMANT. Toggling back to the default SAMP setting does not restore the distortion. It's just plain LesPaulneckmic.When i load the program with its default settings (with distortion), I can very closely simulate this bug by manually turning off the aforementioned settings. Though, in contrast, I can switch between Oscillators and all CLASSIC, WAVE, FORMANT, SUPER and SAMP sound full-bodied, with distorted effects, etc. like they should.I suspect it is because I don't have the LesPaulHarmonicW in my library?

The effects and EQ settings are saved with the Stage 3 program, so stepping through the synth presets or simply the OSC types won't bring the EQ/distortion back.

Periodically I'll see a post where someone would like to have the B3 on one panel not use the same Leslie/Reverb effect as the B3 on the other.  As the Stage 3 is programmed to utilize just one Leslie/Reverb setting (can't have a fast Leslie on Panel A and a slow Leslie on Panel B), I put together an easy work-around that uses the Chorus and Stereo Pan effect in place of the slow Leslie for one panel; the reverb on the B3 can also be set differently than what's used on the panel with the Leslie. For those playing in mono, I would suggest replacing the Stereo Pan effect with a Tremolo effect set lightly and at the same slow rate as the Chorus effect.

The backbone of synth sounds in EDM is both compressors and expandersside chained to rhythmic parts. So you get beating and ducking effects. If you are using something like Mainstage, and have a bass drum mic on stage, you can do the side chaining there. Otherwise just start basically all the sounds with Super Saw (or unison + detune), and morph the filter and volume as you wish.The sound you ultimately use depends highly on what you are after arrangement-wise.If your guitarist is telling you to replicate these sounds perfectly, politely tell him to ""sod off"".

I just came across this and am surprised it sat unanswered as we have so many helpful folks on the Forum.  Here's something to get you started - left of the split is a pad and right of the split is a mono synth with glide to cover the initial intro.  For the second program, both synths are placed on the left with soft Silver Grand on the right.  If you don't have my specific piano sample, you can designate another that sounds close.  Using the mono synth can be tricky when playing it with chords as I do in the attached demo, as you have to play each chord so that the top note is the last one hit or the mono synth will go to an unintended key.  Frankly, it may not be worth it to you to keep the mono synth for that part as you'll be able to play more freely to cover other parts that go with the piano.

As soon as I have access to it I can tell you the settings, it should be easy to recreate with the synth setion of your stage.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=152131&sid=a1299f703f04239b80fc58da9bcf9b74#p152131

Below are a few programs and samples I put together for ""Telephone Line"" by ELO. The intro program uses the Control Pedal for the wah effect placed on the synth, the verse program has strings on the left hand so the low piano notes can be easily added, and the chorus program uses the Control Pedal to add in strings an octave higher than the other strings during the manual arpeggio. There's a Rhodes used lightly with effects in all three.  I've also provided two samples, the one used in the program has the full electronic intro on the low keys and the C2 note and above just have the telephone for the middle of the song (1st MP3 example below); the other sample is a little smaller if you don't want the full intro (2nd MP3 example below). I couldn't find a telephone sample that matched the song, so I took another, changed the pitch, tone duration and period between tones to get closer to the original. BTW, the MP3 didn't record well, so there's some line noise in the long intro that won't be in the actual sample.  The WAV file is also attached below if you want to play around with it in the Sample Editor. The versatility of the Stage 3 comes out in this one.

Some of the classic programs are fairly simple, but I thought some of you might appreciate saving a little time with something to start with and tweak.

Even if I delete samples from the stock collection to add space, I keep those sample locations open and load new samples in locations 250 and above.

I finished the Stage 3 program this morning adding the other parts to the song with the lower split covering a shallow Rhodes that morphs out as the analog strings morph in with the control pedal, and the intro piano and LFO synth are on the upper split.

""Simple Machine"" uses a sawtooth wave (what's typically used for an analog brass sound) and has the Modulation Mod Env applied to an OSC2 setting of the shape and Unison set on 1. I am not sure if you'll get the same effect utilizing Mod Env on the Stage 2. The synth in the song changes in different ways so what may work for the beginning may need to be changed for other parts - I'll be interested to hear what Davywavy comes up with using the Autowah effect.  As the Stage 2 doesn't have the synth Drive settings 1-3, you could use the Drive on the EQ that can be morphed to the control pedal or mod wheel for sound flexibility.

The Stage 3 program below uses the sample ""Child Of Love W.NSMP"". When you load it with Nord Sound Manager, NSM will ask if you want to convert it to NSMP3 format; after you agree it will load just fine as long as you have enough synth sample memory available. With the program you have the options of manually playing the notes with the Arpeggiator on (full chords are assigned to G1, C2, F2, and G2), or turning the Arpeggiator off and using the synth HOLD toa) play the chord progression on Bb1 taken from the program sound;b) play the chord progression on E1 taken from the original intro sample (turn off Tremolo, EQ, and Chorus, and turn FREQ to max); orc) play the chord progression on F1 taken from the original intro sample with high hat partially taken out (turn off Tremolo, EQ, and Chorus, and turn FREQ to max)Using the synth HOLD allows you to use both hands to play the piano.  The manual version will make it easier to sync from time to time with your drummer. The AMP Release is set so that the sound has some presence after the notes are triggered. The Tremolo puts emphasis on parts of the Arpeggiator sound . The program sound can be tweaked using FREQ, EQ, and other settings - when I get a chance I'll work on it further but I wanted to get this to you to play around with.I assigned a B3 and Strings to the right split so that they can be brought into the mix with the piano using the Control Pedal (similar to my Utility program). For the program I use the White Grand and Blue Swede Upright with Chorus applied. On the recording the piano sounds like a CP80 Electric Grand with Chorus, but I thought Blue Swede would work well.MP3 files are provided below with the some options played.

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated!MarkHey Mark,I haven't covered that song, but it is freaking awesome! Those synth sounds, off the top of my head, almost sounds like you could use 1-2 sounds and get the sounds by tweaking knobs or morphing things like resonance and filter. I'd need to do a deeper dive to really work it out, but I think a basic Moog-like lead would be a good starting place and then you just need to adjust things like filter and resonance.If you want a potential starting point, check out the lead synth I created for The Cars ""Bye Bye Love"" as I think it has some usability for this song.post146682.html?hilit=bye%20bye#p146682If I get time over the weekend, I'll see if I can be more helpful.

Great song! There really aren't many stand-out keyboard parts in the song, other than what appears to be one or two different synth bass sounds occurring in the intro and repeating later in the song. This sounds like a pretty basic type of Moog like bass that I bet can be found in the NS3 synth presets. The repetitive played A note seems like it may have a quicker decay than the A-F#-D, which sustains a bit more and maybe has a touch more resonance.During the verse and chorus, it's harder to hear, but there may be a bright synth pad type sound mirroring the guitar chords.

Regarding your sampling issue, it sounds like all you need to do after loading your samples into the Nord Sample Editor 4 is enable ""looping"" and set where you want the loop to start and end if you don't care for the loop NSE4 automatically assigns. Along with the NSE4 manual, ""My Keys To Music"" on YouTube has a free series of videos on sampling that may help. Though you are sampling for 5 seconds (good practice to start with long samples, you can always shorten them in the NSE4), you'll find that for some samples you can loop them at a shorter duration after working with them in NSE4 to reduce the Nord sample size.

I don't own any Nord yet, but I've read whole Stage 3 manual few times and it's quite intuitive. Short answer, no it's not possible to layer two samples on the same A or B panel.But there is workaround to make something similar. If you use Nord Sample Editor, you can record each of the 2 or more samples you want to layer together and connect them into one sample.But there is a catch, before recording your samples into a DAW or Sample Editor, you should make all your desired settings for each sample to get what you want from them. Because when you connect those 2 or more samples together into one, and load them into Nord, there will be no way to control different parameters for each independent sample, because they're all layered together into one.So Nord reads them as one sample --> all effects, parameters inside synth section affect that whole sample (group you made)... but there you have it, that's the way you can have more than two sample layers on any Nord, but it's a little bit limited, so how useful is that depends on your needs.P.S. don't forget to read manual, it's really necessary and important to get most out of your stage 3. I don't get people who own that beautiful keyboard and don't read manual and do some research. I can't afford it at a moment, but I've done so so many research, read so much stuff about it, watched many many videos, and had a chance to play it 3-4 times in my local store for 1 or 2 hours... that's all... but it's  worth it to me, and can't wait a day when I'll probably own one.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=145113&sid=874da6e516bcdbf47df70b8ccb3390f3#p145113

The arp section of the Stage is not very powerful, for example. No sequencer. Little capability for EDM (only 1 LFO). That's what you might need in a cover band - as far as I've understood.If you say: I want to make my own sounding and want to be able to hook up a new sound in a few seconds or change my settings softly or dramatically while playing, a Nord is great.I'm the keyboarder in a big band playing jazz, latin and pop standards - mostly with a different sounding than the original (special arrangements, no covers). So the capabilities of a Stage are far more than I need for that as nobody is asking me to sound exactly like XY.What I intended to say is: A Stage 3 cannot be the best instrument on the market for everything - as some people seem to think. But I have experienced that it has pushed my creativity. Of course, it's primarily made for live use - with a distinct idea behind what live playing could mean.Tristanmac wrote:I assumed as it was super easy to build a patch, piano/organ/pads, easily turn on/off or blend, and sounded great that it would be ideal for the meat and potatoes of any keys player?I fully agree on that. Even if I don't know what you exactly mean by a meat and potato sound (I'm not a native English speaker). To me, it's acoustic piano (great uprights!), Rhodes, Wurly, Clavinet, electric organs and a little synth playing. A Nord Stage will even provide some vegetable and sauce. And indeed: for the rest (whatever that is), you still have the Nord Sample Editor and the Extern section.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=145136&sid=874da6e516bcdbf47df70b8ccb3390f3#p145136

A recent post in the main Stage Forumnord-stage-forum-f3/stage-3-synth-progr ... 21767.htmlhad a question about setting up a synth program allowing a single note to fall off in pitch over one or two beats after being hit. I offered a couple suggestions and then messed around with it further on my Stage 3.  Getting the pitch of a note to slide down, slide up, or both, without the use of morphing or the pitch stick is something the NS3 can cover well (as long as you don't need the effect on a Super or Sample waveform), however absent full ADSR capability, the effect cannot be delayed for some period after playing a note within one synth program.  To get around that, here are a couple of programs where I use two synth programs - the primary sound on one panel and a sliding pitch sound on the second panel with the Delay effect used to bring it in later than when the note is played. For the DX7 program, the Delay effect is on panel A with the AMP ENV Attack bringing it in slowly to somewhat coincide with the primary sound on Panel B decaying out. To learn more about it, there's nothing like turning the knobs and seeing what they do, so load a DX7 version and see if you can create the Analog Brass version from it - all are posted.  Good luck!Update Nov 26, 2021: Replaced the DX7 program with versions sliding (gliding) up and sliding down, and added a ""Syndrum"" program.DX7 SlidinDown W.ns3f(592 Bytes) Downloaded 165 timesDX7 SlidinDown W NS3F Example2.mp3DX7 SlidinUp   W.ns3f(592 Bytes) Downloaded 171 timesDX7 SlidinUp W NS3F Example.mp3Brass Slidin5thW.ns3f(592 Bytes) Downloaded 202 timesBrass Slidin5thW NS3F Example.mp3For the ""Syndrum"" program, both panels are used with the electronic drum on Panel A and an overlapping white noise ""hit"" on Panel B.

You can assign engines to a particular split section by either holding the ""Shift"" button and pressing the On/Off/Zone Select button, or by quickly double-pressing that button.Switch on the rotary speaker (to ""organ""), set the organ model to ""B3"" and adjust drawbars to taste (I'd probably start with 888800036 or so, probably with chorus set to C3).Next, select the synth presets for the horns — you can press the ""Shift"" button an turn the ""synth preset"" knob to have it show a list of sounds that you scroll through.Choose a baritone sax synth preset for the synth on Panel A, and a full brass synth preset for the synth on Panel B.What you're *not* going to get is the bell ride he's playing on the highest note during the pre-chorus, but I have no idea why you'd want to play that, anyway.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=147871&sid=874da6e516bcdbf47df70b8ccb3390f3#p147871

Using compression (far right on the Nord) can help notes retain a higher output level (but losing some initial dynamics if up too much) giving the impression of a longer sustain, however other options include adding a longer-sustaining piano sample to the synth section and having it fade in behind your primary piano, or incorporating a light ""pad"" behind the piano in the mix that can hold for a longer duration without standing out. Here are a couple examples with the pads further out in the mix but easy to move back using the Control Pedal. Follow the links to get to the programs that you can load into your Stage 3 using the Nord Sound Manager.

Using the Nord Sound Manager available on the Nord site athttps://www.nordkeyboards.com/software- ... nd-manageryou can load the programs into your Stage 3.

I use a Yamaha FC-7 for my control pedal, but a search for ""control pedal"" in this Forum will yield other suggestions as well.  Adding an EP in the other panel as suggested by Rusty Mike or simply adding a nice long reverb effect can add character to the piano without overshadowing it.

Learning more about the Stage 3 after the post above, it is possible to get two notes using OSC1 and OSC2 on the Stage 3 (one Synth slot). Obwanz has a Stage 3 version posted before mine that I really like where synth effects are morphed to the Mod Wheel for sounds at the end of the song.

I'm currently running 1/4 in. to XLR hybrid cables directly to the board. The tech at Guitar Center had told me I should try running straight 1/4 in. to the board or utilize a direct box. Had mentioned level impedance as the cause for sounds lacking fullness. Would the variation in hybrid cable to straight instrument cable have that big of an impact on sound? If this is the case the problem might lie entirely with how I'm getting to the board rather than within the sounds themselves.Thanks in advance for any advice on the subject.Spencer,https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=145906&sid=298e57c9dd053acc6a033742428c7e97#p145906

Watching Edgar Winter play it live on the video below helps in seeing how it's played and also what's in some of the sounds used.  A control knob to the left provides the wide pitch swings; setting up the synth to use only OSC2 will provide the wide swings but they will be digital stairs steps, not the smooth analog pitch changes.  The ""wah"" effect is either provided by a traditional wah wah pedal or possibly a control pedal for the ARP. The first sound used is a classic analog synth with portamento and some amount of release, but the other after the drums has a pulse LFO applied and possibly an octave trigger (notes toggling an octave like you'd get with the single octave arpeggiator playing individual notes). Later it gets even more interesting when Edgar moves to the ARP panel; the panel B synth for my program ""WannitBBBadSyncW.ns3f"" atnord-stage-3-programs-ns3p-ns3pb-files- ... 15748.htmlhas some similar effects that can be adjusted in real-time if you'd want to try messing around with it for that part (MP3 provided below).

Fantom might be ""better"" if changing controls/adjusting sounds in a live situation is not needed that much but you need other features like multi-layer samples of natural instuments, more parts, integrated sequencer etc. - very different concepts between those two (or in general between Nords and the ususal workstation suspects)I for one do not need all these additional functions anymore which a workstation like the Fantom or also the Montage / Kronos / .....  provides, for the band I'm playing I need a good sounding B3 organ with direct access to the controls, great piano sounds and the ablity to add pads and some synth sounds which I can shape to my needs whenever I want on stage, hence the Nord Stage is the perfect keyboardfor me.Long story short - it's you alone who can answer your question. I suggest you go and test both a Nord and a Frantom in light of the music you will play live and, much more important,howyou will play live, then decide if the one or the other suits your needs best (or maybe none of them ...)Edit: I understand from your other thread that you have already purchased a Nord Stage 3 76HP, are you able to return it for another one like the NS3 88, or isn't it a bit too late otherwise to ask these questions?",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=145140&sid=298e57c9dd053acc6a033742428c7e97#p145140

In the last 8 years, that 88-key has been the Nord Stage 2 (first the original, then the EX).But more and more, I was realizing that it was probably too much and I was sticking with the 88 keys purely out of habit, being a trained pianist.For my jazz band, where I only play piano, I don't need all the extra functionalities of the Stage.For my cover bands, where I play all sorts of sounds, I don't need the 88 keys.In any and all situations, I was getting tired of lugging a big stage piano up and downstairs, on cramped stages in small venues, etc.So, for the jazz band I got a Yamaha P-121: decent acoustic pianos (the only sounds I use there), onboard speakers, 10 kilos, 73 keys of Yamaha GH hammer action, surely not the best around, but not the worst for sure (I actually like it a bit more than the FATAR TP/40 in the Stage).And now I just substituted my NS2 88 with the Compact version: 100% of the sonic power in only 80% of the size and 50% of the weight. The VERY rare occasions when I miss the extra keys are when I had programs with complex splits and layers which used the whole keyboard. But I just had to reprogram those patches (making new custom-mapped samples in a couple of occasions) and that was it, I really didn't lose anything from the performance side.Of course the piano sounds are less enjoyable on the SW action, but for comping behind a band it's more than good enough. When I REALLY need, I can always bring along the P-121 to have an extra set of weighted keys, and the two instruments together weigh barely more than the NS2 HA88 by itself.In the studio, I don't miss the weighted keys because I play the Nord pianos in the Compact via MIDI, from my Kawai CN-27 with the excellent RH-III action (the same as the Nord Grand).So, for the first time in my whole life, I'm without a 88-key piano for gigging. Does it feel weird? Of course.Does it make my performance worse in any way? Not at all.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=145261&sid=298e57c9dd053acc6a033742428c7e97#p145261

Any samples provided for the Nord Stage 3 can directly be used with the NW2, however I anticipate that you would then have to set up the synth and effects parameters to get your NW2 program to sound close to the NS3 program (absent any piano or organ that might also be in the NS3 patch).

To address the problem I would record a WAV file of the notes with the Arpegiator and string swell using Audacity (or other recorder/editor software). Load your sample into an empty program so all synth parameters are at their default and all effects are off; you want the sample you create to be in the same raw format as the original (granted the original will be playing through the HP12 filter). Play all the notes you need sampled starting from the bottom and leaving a clean break between notes. Once your WAV file is created (save the original), change the pitch of the notes in the WAV file you need altered and save it under a new name for importing into the Nord Sample Editor.  If you use Audacity, make sure the lower left box is checked to use high quality stretching (see pic). The tricky part of putting together a sample meant to be transposed is with split points, understanding that transposing the Nord down a half step means that the sample you create will have all notes shifted UP a half step (whatever is on B will play on the C note for example). Addressing the split point(s): If the two sounds have a split point set at C3, you'll want the range of your lower sample to end at Bb2 and the range of the upper sample to start at B2.  When you transpose down a half step on the Stage 3, the sample will shift UP a half step so that upper sample will start at C3. Make sense?

Like the original recording, the acoustic piano (White Grand Large) is panned to the left and the DX7 (DX7 Rhodes Piano Sample) is panned to the right, and I added the DX7 synth sample across both.  The program can be easily modified if you want to layer all of them rather than playing acoustic with left hand and Rhodes with right.  A synth panel is left available for adding strings or monophonic synth for the short solo.

Marimba available at the Nord site:https://www.nordkeyboards.com/sound-lib ... us/marimbaProgram ""Toto Africa p1 W"": This program is used for the Intro, First Verse and End, with synth brass/marimba on left and Africa_split sample/marimba on right.  The filter for the brass is morphed to both the Mod Wheel and Aftertouch - the MW allows for nice adjustment if you want the sound a little brighter and AT is used at the end of the verse (listen to end of mp3). The Marimba in the piano section is used for both slots, and the delay effect is set at a tight slapback to sound like multiple players. The sample and Marimbas are morphed to the control pedal to pull them out of the mix during the verse. For those of you limited on sample space, I've added a second program ""Toto Africa p1bW"" using the Kalimbas that are pre-loaded in the Stage 3 - the high end could be tweaked a little.Toto Africa Intro and First Verse.mp3Toto Africa p1 W.ns3fStage 3 Program for ""Africa"" by Toto - Intro using ""Africa_split.nsmp3"" sample(592 Bytes) Downloaded 1225 timesafrica_split.nsmp3Sample with synth and kalimbas for ""Africa"" by Toto(2.17 MiB) Downloaded 933 timesToto Africa p1bW.ns3fStage 3 Program for ""Africa"" by Toto - Intro using Nord Kalimba sample(592 Bytes) Downloaded 1007 timesProgram ""Toto Africa p3 W"": This program is used for the 2nd verse where brass is on the left and mono synth is on the right.

The delay effect is set at a tighter slapback than the intro but not as heavy so it wouldn't sound like sloppy playingFor those of you who would prefer to play the part with your hands overlapping in the same split so you could set up another part on the keyboard as well, I also have ""Toto AfricaSol2W"" posted that also uses the Africa sample.

Most of the classic programs are fairly simple, but I thought some of you might appreciate saving a little time with something to start with and tweak. Note that most of my programs use the control pedal morph even if only to bring instruments in and out of a mix.With some of these programs you may need to relink the piano(s) to what you have in your Stage 3, as one of the first things I did when I got my Stage 3 was replace some pianos with smaller files to add more - I have 48 at this time.All sample locations below 250 are pre-loaded Stage 3 locations that I don't mess with.  Even if I delete samples from the stock collection to add space, I keep those sample locations open and load new samples in locations 250 and above. The programs below use all the ""stock"" samples except for the James Taylor song which uses ""SynthPad2__CL stereo 3.0"" in location 252.It doesn't matter which sample memory locations you store new samples in your Nord Stage 3, just make sure that after you load a program, that you point the Slot A and/or Slot B Synth to the correct sample in your system. For example, if you load ""SynthPad2__CL stereo 3.0"" into your sample location 280 (252 in mine), then you just need to point Slot B to 280 rather than 252.I'll revise this post as needed based on questions, so feel free to comment.Take care.I found the program for the 10cc song ""I'm Not In Love"" on this site for the Stage 2.

I'm glad to contribute this so hopefully more folks will also choose to cover it with their band.  The first program uses the DX7 synth sample that comes with the Stage 3 and has the synth special effect on the other panel. The second (main) program covers the synth bass with vibrato on AT and DX7/Strings. The third program has the softer DX7/bell sound with the synth bass on the other panel.  The approach to the programs would be a little different if I wasn't using the 2nd synth panel for the synth bass, but I like the effect in the song. If you're playing with a bass player and together the lows are too overpowering, trimming off the bass in the panel EQ might be a better option than turning down the synth Level so you keep the effect.

I'm sure You will come prety close if you play around with those parametres.Another option instead of setting the LFO opening and closing the filter, is to assign it to the Mod Wheel or Pedal so that you can control the motion yourself.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=140800&sid=6c71460bda61441d4e8ca26ecb1f9ff7#p140800

Below are two programs I put together for ""Babe"" by Styx.  The Rhodes EP1 (Version 6) has the Dyno filter set and EQ'd to bring out the tines even more with the midrange boosted at 5K Hz and treble flat.  I have the same piano mapped on the lower/mid range for Slot A and upper split for Slot B as I set up program 1 so I can bring in the strings and mono synth on the upper split with the Control Pedal and while simultaneously taking out the upper Slot B Rhodes. If you listen closely to the actual song, it sounds like the upper D note on the Rhodes has more of a tine sound than some others since they are individually voiced, and the lower notes especially don't have quite as much, so you may want to trim off the mid and treble a little on the Rhodes for Slot A if it's too much after listening to it through your rig, but try it first - some really like the distinctive sound so I biased it that way. I hope some of you can make use of this. Take care.Note: If you don't play live with your Stage 3 in stereo, you'll lose the stereo panning effect that's part of the original sound, so you may need to play around with the Phase Shifter a little more or use the Chorus effect.The mp3 covers:a) Program 1 - the intro with the Control Pedal down so you hear the upper range of the Rhodes,b) Program 1 - the Control Pedal up to take out the upper Rhodes and bring in the Strings on lower split and Mono synth on the upper split,c) Program 2 - Rhodes, B3 and stock Stage 3 voice sample in mono, played during the guitar solo making sure the highest note is hit last so the voice on the highest note comes out while the chord is being played, andd) Program 2 - an alternative for the guitar solo part with the Rhodes, B3, and voices on the left hand and another mono synth on the right hand (arpeggiator used to make it easy, but can be turned off).

Cheers for the helpHello, you're definitely getting there. I have a few suggestions that hopefully will help get it where you want it.  Listening to the original I hear a faint note playing an octave lower than what I consider to be the primary note; there isn't a distinct character to the tone, so for the sample I'd suggest adding a sine wave to OSC2, setting it an octave lower than the sax and slightly blending it in.  It sounds like you might already be capturing the other sound an octave higher than the sax with the sawtooth, but another option (if not already programmed this way) is to set the sawtooth OSC1 at the same octave as the Sax sample and use a sawtooth for OSC2 set an octave higher and blend the two.  It sounds like you recorded the sound off a speaker where I'm also hearing perhaps the keys being played, but I'm hearing more initial attack (like a piano) than the sound on the original.  I would suggest setting the filter and amp attack slightly above zero on the sounds used (sawtooth especially) and setting the release about 9-10 o'clock.  Here's an example of an analog brass program that has settings that you could play around with.

I have been living in here, and on Youtube trying to learn as much as I can about it, but I still have some questions relating to grabbing sounds in here, and loading them.1 - I went through all the pages and downloaded about 20 sounds/samples that would be awesome to use in my band. I see that the Nords come from factory pretty full of sounds so I am guessing in order to customize this board to my preference with all sounds for my use, I'll need to delete a bunch of factory sounds for space? I went through every factory sound, and made a list of ones I'll never use. If I just go in Editor and do a mass delete of a bunch of these sounds, will that throw off other sounds that may be sharing some of the same voices or properties??2 - I see many people in here upload MP3s, so if I want that sample sound, do I just upload their MP3 file? Will they (in some cases) bring all the other sounds (drums etc) in as well?  Or can I only upload a .ns3f file into the Stage 3?)3 - Huge question. Is there a player out there that I can preview the sound files with, without having to upload it into the stage 3. Like a file player for a quick reference? I see some put files on out there to share, but no MP3 or way to ""preview"" them. Or does everything have to go through the upload to Stage 3 and play process?Finally for now, Can the User edit the factory program sounds? Example I found one I liked but wanted the delay off of it. For the life of me I cannot seem to figure out how to edit factory sounds (I have memory off too if that matters)?Sorry for all the questions but I'm loving this thing and want to get it up and running asap, and cannot locate the answers to the above questions.Thanks on advance and much appreciated~~",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=139259&sid=6c71460bda61441d4e8ca26ecb1f9ff7#p139259

And welcome to the forum.1. So, NS3 has 2 GB of piano and 480MB of synth memory. If you want to put new sounds on, you obviously must have enough memory equivalent to the size of that particular sounds. Nord sound manager has a feature where you can select to see all the sounds that are unused (when I say unused, I mean sounds that are not being used by any progam). I would suggest that you delete them first (those you don't like), that will probably make some memory already. If that's not enough, deleting sound that is being used in any program/s will change that programs. So if you like some programs with sounds you don't like, try to avoid deleting them.2. You can't upload mp3 directly to the board, but you can use sample manager to sample it to your board.3. As much as I know, you can use Nord sound manager and whatever sound you click on, you will be able to play it instantly on a board. I think there is no such player that can do that for Nord (but not sure about that one).You should be able to edit factory sounds, but not that you can change them permanently like a sound, rather you can tweak their parameters in order to achieve your desired type of sound and save it per program. Then you can copy panels to make it easier for you to use that sound again.I don't own Nord yet, but I love it and it's my dream, so I have a lot of research behind me for NS3, that's where my info comes from.

Both sections have their own amount of available memory to hold samples, for pianos the space is 2GB, for synth  samples it is 480MB and they are totally separated from each other, you also cannot make use of some free space in the synth section to store a piano sample there and vice versa. Also the samples for the piano section are provided by Nord exclusively, those cannot be created by users. Samples for the synth section can be loaded both from Nord but also from others, like you will find massively here in the forum - those samples are either .nsmp or .nsmp3 files.If you mean samples when talking about sounds, and you want to add some more to the Nord you need to check if the respective memory section has enough free space to load additional samples, otherwise need to delete some which you don’t need. Deleting a sample affects all programs (see following item b) which make use of this sample. Best way is to delete the program first which you don’t need, and then see if Nord Sound Manager marks the sample as “unused”, which means that no other program makes use of it and you can then delete it.b) a programThis holds all information which is needed to play a certain sound, it contains for example the organ settings, the specific piano sample and all related settings, the synth settings or synth samples which are needed, all effects settings etc. - this combines a whole bunch of different settings. Programs do not have any effect on memory usage, there are 400 programs which can be used, deleting programs does not have an effect on memory.For question 2: the MP3 files are provided here to be able to listen to the sound of a specific sample, but MP3 files cannot loaded into the Nord Stage. It makes use of .nsmp3 samples which are loaded on the Stage by using Nord Sound Manager, this software is also able to convert the (older) .nsmp format into the .nsmp3 format when uploading them to the Stage.For question 3: the answer is “no” - you can listen to .nsmp or .nsmp3 samples only if you load them onto the Nord, create a program which makes use of the sample and then play. That’s the reason why people usually provide MP3 files with an example of how the sample will sound (see above)For your last question: yes absolutely, you can edit factory program and change every single bit of it, you just have to make sure to switch memory protection off in the general settings to be able to save what you have changedHope it helps a bit - I recommend to listen to some tutorials which are available on YouTube, one very good channel is “My Keys To Music” atand also this one:and read the manual",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=139262&sid=6c71460bda61441d4e8ca26ecb1f9ff7#p139262

Below are a few tips that might come in handy for freeing up sample memory using the Nord Sound Manager:- View your current samples in ""organize"" mode to show open memory locations.- Sort samples from largest to smallest and delete the ones you don't want starting with the largest so you're freeing up the most space without losing as many samples.- Save all new samples to memory locations 250 and above so you can keep track of what samples you added versus the ones (0-249) that came with the Stage 3.Regarding the Piano memory, when I first got my Stage 3 I replaced all the XL pianos with smaller versions and then added others to have a wider selection available to me. In a live band setting the additional quality of the fully-mapped keyboard of the XL is lost, so I opted for quantity and variety. The current list for my Piano section with 45 available Grands, Uprights, EPianos and others is at the following post if you are interested.

They can be used by a synth engine set to “sample” mode. The .nsmp3 format includes support for default parameters like attack or release settings, as well as filter adjustments, that make them more useful immediately, without needing any setting-up. These files are copied onto the machine and can be used in a program or several programs, or not at all..npno files — same thing, but available only to the piano engine. Different sample format (including multiple velocity layers)..ns3f files are full Nord Stage 3 programs that go in the program section. They contain the settings for one organ, one piano, and one synth for each of the two layers — regardless of whether those engines are actually switched on in the program. Effects settings are also saved, of course. They DO NOT include the samples or piano files — merely information about which ones are used. These are machine-specific and can only be read by Nord Stage 3..ns3y files are synth presets that go in the synth section and can be stored as part of a program on the Stage. Again, specific to the Nord Stage 3..ns3fb is a bundle format that includes the program and any piano/sample files used. It’s just a .zip file with a different ending, so renaming it to “.zip” and unpacking it will alle you to see the samples and pianos, so you can transfer those, at least, to another incompatible machine, as these are, of course, specific to the Stage 3..ns3b is a full backup of the entire machine, including all pianos, all samples, all synth presets, and all programs. It, too, is just a .zip file with a different extension.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=139287&sid=6c71460bda61441d4e8ca26ecb1f9ff7#p139287

Why would you want to make it play that?As you certainly will know, the synth sample engine on a Stage 3 only has one velocity layer, so you won't be able to have different sounds depending on the velocity. You may use your two panels, though, for morphing between two different sounds with the help of a pedal.As you already have that sound, you may record it and transfer it to the Nord Sample Editor. But only for one fixed velocity level. It will remain a compromise. Maybe people would use the Extern section of the Stage 3 and play sounds like that from the computer on stage.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=138913&sid=6c71460bda61441d4e8ca26ecb1f9ff7#p138913

The Nord Stage 3 supports the following pedals for use as the Control Pedal: Fatar, Yamaha FC7, Roland EV-7, Roland EV-5, Korg EXP2 and Korg XVP10.  I have used the Yamaha FC7 for over 30 years and have only had one fail over that whole time (I believe a cable failure due to too many tugs and not enough care). Taking the time to learn how to morph various control parameters (level, freq, rate, etc) to the Control Pedal, Mod Wheel, and/or Aftertouch will open up all kinds of possibilities for what you can do with your Stage 3 - you'll love it.  In case you're interested, I have over 70 programs available at-->nord-stage-3-programs-ns3p-ns3pb-files- ... 15748.htmlthat all use the Control Pedal in some way, even if just to vary the level of an instrument compared to another.

But this is a much more homogeneous instrument where all components seem to come from the same source and stay homogeneous even with EQ or amp sim.The enhanced sample, on the other hand, feels like it comes from different sources and does not blend into a homogeneous instrument even with excessive EQ.The 5.3 sample even sounds even more realistic from the transient phase than the one from back then (4.x).The only thing wrong with the 5.3 sample is that the velocity reacts too sensitive in the NS3 (comp 73).maxpiano wrote:Maybe you are looking for the older 4.x versions, which afaik are no longer available (unless someone saved them and can share with you), however if you look at the bottom of the current pages there is the ""older"" 5.x version in S format, that maybe you like better than 6.x?See for examplehttps://www.nordkeyboards.com/sound-lib ... lose-idealpage, download the S version 5.3 and try it.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=136707&sid=ba3f7ecc4759eb4cb4fc9334bc100b2b#p136707

Taking from the suggestion by alex78 until you find a sample more suitable, try assigning the delay effect to your sample for a single repeat with only the effect sounding (none of the original in the mix). Set the timing for however long you need the sound to play before the drop. Set the Amp Env Attack to fade in. Then find another sample for the other synth slot that doesn't drop and have it fade out as the other is fading in. This has a limited use, as the sound will play after you stop playing a note because of the delay effect. Morphing the levels between the two might help as well, simply turning down one while turning the other up while playing a note, that way one could be used normally and the one with the drop effect brought in only when needed.  I hope you find something better, but this exercise will help in future programming also. Good luck.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=136436&sid=ba3f7ecc4759eb4cb4fc9334bc100b2b#p136436

My mapping is, like yours, 100% complete, although there is always room for bugs, and was developed by me manually over many weeks, by brute force bit comparison, same as you have done for NS3.NS2 coverage:- Organ: 100%- Piano: 100%- Synth: 100%- Morph: 100%- FX: 100%- Global parameters: Master Clock/Transpose/Split 100%- Extern and output sections: 100%I have also shared my complete software with you with MIT license so you are freely allowed to use as you see fit. It provides a more 'performance overview oriented' HTML view of the patch (see images below) which happens to be what I value the most when using hundreds of patches and quickly learning new ones. It is especially important to highlight the morphs and show clearly which parameters are affected by them and how, and to show the split points to quickly remind which hand is doing what and where.The one thing I did not ever achieve is automated conversion from NS2 to NS3. Three reasons:1. no interest in decoding the checksum algorithm to be able to CREATE a valid ns2p/ns3f file (and at first glance it was not trivial what was being checksummed and how)2. not possible to migrate synth programs due to the NS3 INFERIOR FM synth implementation (but superior in other aspects) i.e. not a true superset of NS23. Actually the practical knowledge gained by manually dialling in the settings on my new NS3, rather than an automated conversion, was valuable and really helped me learn the NS3 after having been an NS2 and NS1 expert.-gordon(standard Disclaimer applies here: The author and this work is not affiliated, associated, endorsed by, or in any way officially connected with Nord Keyboards / Clavia DMI AB, or any of its subsidiaries or its affiliates.

That last bit will have been extremely time consuming as the sample names are not stored in the file but, instead, a 'hash' of the name is stored.And as we don't have the hashing algorithm that Nord uses, he's had to individually map, one at a time, EVERY sample to the hash it produces!Being a software engineer, I can tell you this guy has put a HUGE amount of effort into his viewer!I hope my script will prove useful and will hopefully be available in the next week or two.Once again though, huge thanks to Florence and the other guys who contributed to this herculean effortPS. With regards the sample names, user sample names are also stored as hashes so, again, without knowing Nord's hashing algorithm, it's impossible to display the name of a user sample. We don't even know if it's a one-to-one hash-to-name thang or if the hash translates to some sort of internal storage mapping...Of course, if Nord would care to let us in on their hashing algorithm...",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=136353&sid=ba3f7ecc4759eb4cb4fc9334bc100b2b#p136353

English isn't my first language). Isn't there a way to make them more visibile (while still providing some visual clue that the Panel is not active) -- a little less dim, to be actually readable? The ""show all instruments"" settings show them ALL, even the OFF ones, so it becomes a bit confusing visually.2) Try load the attached Program in the tool. You'll notice that, on Panel A's Synth section, it reads ""config: 4 detune"", but the wave type is super, which isn't compatible with the osc configuration 4, ""detune"". I was wondering if the Synth somehow remembers the last setting done on a different wave type and still show it even if it's not applicable in the current settings. For example one selects the classic ""sine"", goes to osc config n. 4, then change the wave type. The osc config n. 4 disappears, but apparently it is still ""remembered"" and saved into the Program.

It kind of sounds like a chromatic glide down the keyboard but haven't had much luck so far creating the sound. Any ideas?....To make a sample, once you have the sound you like (it sounds like a monophonic synth with sustain to me), I would suggest recording the chromatic drop for an octave at a speed to cleanly cover the notes and let the last note sustain a little (or you can sequence it if you have a MIDI sequencer). At this point, don't add any delay effect. In Audacity or other WAV editing software, speed up the tempo (not pitch) of your recording as needed to what's used in the song. Import your saved WAV file into the Nord Sample Editor and set it to loop where it sounds correct to you. Save the file and import the NSMP3 file into your keyboard where you can then work on adding the delay effect to top it off.  That's how I would go at it to start. I hope that helps, take care.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=134227&sid=ba3f7ecc4759eb4cb4fc9334bc100b2b#p134227

Just the original tenor sample from Nord, and then I used the effects, remembering what a sax player I toured with used to tell the sound guys about how he wanted his sound set up.Some doubling delay, quick and with low delay threshold so just one note gets repeated (like a vocal doubling effect.)Some reverb.Some chorus. (I also added in a tremolo setting too.)I used the mid parametric eq sweep to scoop OUT a very 'synthy' frequency that needed to go.Finally, compression, set to 8. Lot's, in other words ... so the airy tones are up there with the screech timbre. On a big rock stage, it's those timbres you want, all of them, soft and hard, without dropping out or ripping ears.

They will create an illusion of bending down when they release that bite down on the reed, and relax back down to the note they actually played. However, unlike guitar riffs, a sax actually doesn't ever bend down, always up. Remember that with your pitch bend technique, and it goes a long way to adding authenticity. Don't bend down, and you're all good. Only up. A real sax can't bend down, except to return to the note it bent up from. Subconsciously, people will notice this and it helps to make the sound do it's magic.Ya, I'm actually quite happy with this sax patch, which are notorious for not sounding very authentic on most synths.

The sax is all alone on panel B and easy to copy out. Panel A has the organ and piano pad, which is where the patch size expands, likely the piano sample. But you can scrap that panel A and just take the sax panel out and use it in your own program.That organ on panel A has the rotor morphed so if you set the wheel to just below half way you get the slow leslie effect Wright used on Us and Them. There's enough room under where I have the sax split to play the piano part for Us and Them along with your sax soloing. But you can scrap all that and copy panel B to a new program and you'll just have the sax, and I'm sure it will be a smaller patch then. Maybe.

The result allows you to use your left hand on the pitch stick when you want all the notes on the right hand to slide, or you can play notes with the left hand too and use the AT/CP control to sound as if you are pressing a pedal or knee lever on a pedal steel to affect just those notes played.The first program allows the left notes to be ""bent down"" by the Control Pedal and ""bent up"" with AfterTouch.

The last two pedal steel programs don't use a sample as the OSC2 function used to bend a note up or down with AT can't be used for that function with a sampled sound. Podmed posted a nice sample of a lap steel at the link below if you want to try that for general playing as well.

You should be able to download the Program files to your computer and then with your Nord Sound Manager connected to your NS3, download them into the Program section of the instrument. A few require specific samples and the Sound Manager should help you with this as it will show ""missing"" sounds whether Piano or other samples.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=129125&sid=ba3f7ecc4759eb4cb4fc9334bc100b2b#p129125

As suggested by EricL, there are some programs that need a sample loaded using Sound Manager. It's also possible that you may need to relink the pianos, as some may point to pianos that I added or replaced with a smaller versions than what you might have.  All of that can be done using the Sound Manager which will tell you if a sample or piano is not found.  Let me know if you have any luck or are continuing to have problems.

And tweak a lot to see what affection each parameter has to your sound. Good luck!Support this. A few days ago I looked up how E-Guitarists create their sound. In short, it's more working backwards (from Amp to Effects) and providing a matching sample as input. Results became better, and I see some things I probably can't do with the NS3 alone (harmonizer etc.).Also experimenting with sounds will help. E.g. mixing 2nd harmonic wave (A) with 3rd, or 4th and so on (B) is interesting.In summary what helps me is to separate Effects (reverb, flange etc.) from the sound I'm after, trying to figure out the sounds basic ingredients and try finding something that comes close enough.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=130604&sid=bdc106a7c5ac64b59eaa8b8dd4734780#p130604

What sample or oscillator you use?There are perhaps some basics that could be taught, but I agree with the comments here that for the most part it's your own experimentation that will get you where you want to be. Among the basics of a sound, I listen for what the sound is doing. Does it start with a sharp attack or fade in? Does the filter simply decay or is there a slight effect of it opening up first like you hear on an analog brass sound? Is the sound exactly the same no matter how long it's held?  Getting into the oscillators you can play around for hours, especially digging into the OSC2 functionality that adds a lot of flexibility to modifying the sound. You can learn a lot by taking apart programs as well and seeing what oscillators were used to create the sounds. Overall it will take some time, but I think you're already on a good path of learning what the synth can do for you, rather than go the path of simply sampling - you'll get more out of it.

It sounds more like a dance/trance/house kind of sound but I'm not sure, and also have no clue about how to generate this from the NS3 synth secion (I'm quite bad at synthesis ...).

As you are really looking at nailing this, the only suggestion I would have would be to perhaps use samples for the 32nd notes specific for the notes played (there's just a few) so that each note plays at the same tempo as the song rather than slower or faster depending on key played. That's the only bad thing about sampling when the tempo is part of the sampled sound - it doesn't interpolate well.

I'm not quite happy yet with the right-hand synth but it's a decent start - back in the 80s on my Prophet 10 I programmed it starting from a steel drum patch. You can use this to make a second program keeping most of it but replacing the right-hand synth for the other that comes in during the verse.Update April 15, 2020: I worked on the left-hand and right-hand synths a little more tonight and added a MP3 example - the new program is ""Maniac A  W.ns3f"". I copied that program, replaced the right-hand synth for what's used at the end of the verse, and named it ""Maniac B  W.ns3f"" .

The overall feeling of the song is very van halen-ish anyway...Let us not forget that all those hair metal groups of this era were highly affected by Van halen's technique and massive sound. You can create the intro sound by layering an overdrive guitar sample, as WannitBBBad said, with a simple sawtooth wave, tweak the filter to find the sweet spot and apply those effects. The main songs consists of a classic b3 rock organ and a typical Jump-style synth sound, check this video on how to create it (it's not for nord stage but that kind of 80's sound is bread and butter for nord's synth engine)For the arpeggio sound all you have to do is morph the attack and decay of the same sound to make it shorter and sharper, and maybe close the filter a bit.

Så vælger du et klaver du vil have i klaver sektionen og slår de andre sektioner fra. Så trykker du på b og vælger de to andre lyde i de andre sektioner, og så trykker du på a og b samtidigt. Derefter blinker det aktive panel og du kan så justere niveauer mm eller trykke på den anden knap for at gøre det andet panel aktivt. Hvis du kun vil have en lyd ad gangen, så tryk begge ned og slip den ene først så kan du bare trykke enten a eller b for kun at have den ene.Short answer in the official forum language (which is what we're all kindly requested to use, myself included): The manual is your best friend",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=127861&sid=bdc106a7c5ac64b59eaa8b8dd4734780#p127861

Du wählst zunächst Panel A aus und stellst dort nur das Grand Piano ein, danach wählst du Panel B und dort die Farfisa Orgel und in der Synth Sektion das Sample für die Strings. Danach kannst du beim Spiel zwischen Panel A und Panel B umschalten.Farfisa und Strings kannst du entweder parallel spielen oder du teilst die Tastatur mir Keyboard Split auf, so dass du auf einem Teil der Tastatur die Farfisa und auf dem anderen die Strings spielen kannst.BTW: Google Translate can be helpful for both of us but it would be easier to use English, don’t you think so?",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=127862&sid=bdc106a7c5ac64b59eaa8b8dd4734780#p127862

My kid immediately started digging into it, turning off the organ and piano engines so just the synth was left. Then asked me, ""can you make a program of just that?""It's two layered synths - both square waves, but it sounds like synth strings. Changing them to triangle, sawtooth or different duty cycles changes the timbre in interesting ways too, but sticking with square waves for now. The LFO on panel B, the ""shape"" modulation, unison = 3 and the LP filter/Mod Env are the secret sauce here.I added arpeggiation just to panel B, I really like what it does (thus ""random"" in the name).

Adding an extra 50€ in components and circuit board would be about a €500 premium.

Look at it this way:Korg Combi = up to 16 internal or external soundsYamaha Performance = up to 4 internal soundsYamaha Performance placed into a Master = up to 4 internal sounds plus up to 8 external soundsNord Program = up to 2 sounds (panels), but each of these sounds in turn can contain a piano sound, an organ sound, a synth/sample sound, and an external sound. So instead of looking at it as a combination of 2 sounds, you could also say that Nord Program = up to 6 internal sounds plus up to 2 external sounds (with the additional qualification that the 6 internal sounds can be up to two piano library sounds, up to two organ sounds, and up to two synth/sample sounds).But no matter how you look at it, a single Nord Program is already a combination of multiple sounds.Here's the important part. It is true that you cannot combine two Nord Programs,but you similarly cannot combine two Korg Combis or two Yamaha Performances/Masters.Don't forget that a Nord Program is not a single sound like a Korg Program is or like a Yamaha Voice is... rather a Nord Program isalreadya combination of multiple sounds (up to 8... 2 synth programs, 2 pianos, 2 organs, and 2 external MIDI sounds).And on all these platforms, you cannot combine one combination of multiple sounds with another combination of multiple sounds.(Okay, not counting the rare cases where a single Yamaha Voice or Korg program consist of multiple sound at the Element/Oscillator level.)Now, let's get back to the OP's question: ""I have found 2 different built in patches that I want to layer"" --First, let's assume that by ""patches"" you're talking about programs. Take a look at what is in each panel... you may find that all the sonic components you care about are located on just one of the two panels (maybe even only one of the two panels is sounding by default), and then you can combine the one panel from the first program with the one panel from the second to create a new program that contains what you're looking for from those two patches, as maxpiano alluded to. There are plenty of Nord Programs that default to only one active panel, so there is a reasonable chance you can get exactly what you want this way.Second, let's instead assume that by ""patches"" you're talking about ""synth presets."" Well, then again you're in luck, because you can combine any two synth presets, by putting one on one panel and one on the other.Third, we'll elaborate on the approach Lew suggested, of sampling the sound combination so it becomes a single sound. This approach has numerous significant limitations, but it may be useful anyway. Lew is right that you probably don't want to include the pianos in this approach (largely because they will not sound nearly as good in a single-velocity sample), and as long as--between the two programs you're trying to combine--you don't actually need to play more than two piano sounds simultaneously, there's no need to worry about this, since you can pick up to two piano sounds and copy them into your new combined program anyway (again, as maxpiano alluded to) or recreate them (piano sounds don't have a ton of parameters). Similarly, it is unlikely that, between the two sounds you're trying to combine, you'll need more than two organ sounds, so the same applies, you can manually bring whichever organ sounds you want (up to two of them) to your new combined program. (Sampling organ sounds can be problematic because you can't effectively sample, for example, the percussion or the leslie and retain the original playing characteristics.) The most likely place you're going to want to combine more than two of something is in the sample/synth sections. Here's where you could try what Lew suggested... resample one pair of synth sounds into a single sample set, resample the other pair of synth sounds (assuming you do need the maximum of four) into another single sample set, and then you can layer those two sample sets to get all four sounds. Maybe. It will work better with some kinds of sounds than others. The trickiest part will probably be reproducing the effects. You're still limited in how many effects you can apply at once, and once you merge two sounds, you won't be able to put an effect on one sound without putting the identical effect on the sound you merged it with. An alternate approach could be to sample the sound with the effect you want, so the effect is ""baked into"" the sample itself. But it will likely change the sound... for example if you take a sound that was put through a phaser and sample it with the phaser enabled, when you play back the sampled version, you'll have all the notes behaving with their own phase shift effect instead of all sharing the same one. And some effects, like an echo that happens after you let go of a note, can't really be made part of the sample at all. Modulations within the synth presets themselves can cause similar problems. So, as I said, there are significant limitations. But there are some cases where it could conceivably work.Fourth possible solution... take advantage of the EXT functions, which are currently unused (as they naturally are in all factory programs), and instead of sampling two sounds to turn them into one sound, you can sample up to two of the sound and still keep them separate by sampling into, for example, an iPhone or iPad app, and then use the EXT section to trigger whatever additional sounds you need from that app. You can then use the Nord's usual mechanism to trigger two of the sample/synth sounds, and the EXT functions to trigger two more of them, re-sampled into your other device. For the re-sampling, choose the sounds that least need effects, because if you want them to have effects, you'll have to get them elsewhere (i.e. from another iOS app).In any resampling scenario, one of the other things you'll have to think about when deciding which sound will be where and how you will set it up is whether these are sounds that stop playing when you let go of a key versus ones that gradually decay when you let goThis isn't all easy, and won't necessarily get you what you want. Without knowing which sounds you're trying to combine, I can't tell you whether a given approach will work, or will at least get you something close, or if you barely have a prayer of getting what you're after. But these are at least some things to consider, and even thinking about how these different ideas work may help you better understand how the NS3 does things.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=126639&sid=3b928228f0c004fda10bc8b753af297a#p126639

Not even on other models such as e.g. the Motif you could layer the Combis/LiveSets when they include a full configuration/usage of the keyboard resources (because NS Programs are equivalent to ""combis"" of its 6 engines + 2x extern + effects).I just saw that you had already put more concisely a bunch of what I just posted.BTW, I saw something somewhere that said that, when Nord developed the Stage 3, they discussed whether to support 4 panels or seamless sound switching. (I believe the way seamless switching works is through two ""hidden"" panels which allow them to essentially play 4 panels worth of sound during the times the seamless switching is happening.)

I am a drummer by trade and i know my way around a few other instruments and have a pretty solid knowledge of music / sound in general. That being said, I don’t know a thing about synthesizers or how to get sounds out of them that I can hear in my head.The issue at hand is this: I play drums in the band at a large, very modern church. The church owns a Stage 3 HP76 and we have a few different keyboard players. They’re great, can play anything you throw at them, but none of them have invested time into learning this board in and out, so none of them really go any further than the presets. (I know, it’s a tremendous waste of an extremely high caliber instrument and there are people that would kill to own it who would use it to its fullest potential). Hopefully this changes in the future, but in the meantime we need some help.In a few weeks, we’ll be covering Paramore’s “Fake Happy” and we’re looking to replicate (as close as possible) the synth sound heard throughout. I personally (again, not a keyboard player) have read the entire synth section of the Nord’s manual several times over and have watches many videos and tutorials, but I’m realizing it’s a little deeper than that. There are concepts and terminology around synths that I just don’t understand.

A touch of hall 2 reverb or stage 2 reverb just to add some space to it, add some attack to the strings unless you want a more romantic feel then spread the attack so it's a slow ramp and just soften the bell strike a touch by adding a slight ramp on the attack. This should give you that sound.I'd write the program for you but the studio's offline whilst work's being done to get it comfortable due to some help coming through. once everything's back online, then I'll see what I can do, if not, try it yourself. if it's more of an enya profile for christmas then go to the digital pianos sound and add the mks70 piano to panel B and take the volume down a touch so it's more of a rounded sound to the grand.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=124747&sid=3b928228f0c004fda10bc8b753af297a#p124747

Here are a couple of tips:Make sure that all the settings in the synth section are default and zeroed out.  Start with an empty patch. Add a little reverb.But here is the key.  You must play the sample the way a guitar player would, as is done in the sample in the Nord Library.  Playing the sample from a keyboard player's perspective will never really sound like a guitar.  If you have a guitar, play a few chords, note the order of the notes (much different than a keyboard) and try to emulate strumming a chord.  That should give you more realistic results--dj",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=122701&sid=3b928228f0c004fda10bc8b753af297a#p122701

I was also aware Nord recently kindly put some Chinese samples on their website and I went through every single one in that section few months ago but still with no hope.I understand some comments that the sound based a lot on the technique and mostly using the wheel but it has a distinctive sound which is not easy to replicate even when play a simple note (well not easy for me). Obviously the audience do not expect 100% characteristic of the sound when play on the keyboard (similarly when you play a guitar sound on the keyboard) but they do expect it is close to around 70-80%. Anyway when I posted the question I had very little hope someone would be able to help as it seemed a different world to most of you, you need to understand the sound.

The first program allows the left notes to be ""bent down"" by the Control Pedal and ""bent up"" with AfterTouch. The Control Pedal allows for smoother movement but you sacrifice being able to use the CP for volume. The second program allows the left notes to be ""bent down"" using AfterTouch and the Control Pedal is used for volume.

This uses the Synth to emulate the key click for when the note is played. The Synth and B3 levels are morphed to the Control Pedal.  As the Leslie modifies the B3 key click, I used Chorus on the Synth key click so it's not the exact same sound for every note played. If you want it even closer, you can load the key click Synth in Slot B and route it through the Leslie too.  I use the Amp/EQ to increase the key click volume (midrange works well) but the synth level set for the morph can be reassigned to your taste too.  This is my default B3 with the drawbars morphed to the Mod Wheel for a bit of performance flexibility.

If you don't have a control pedal, I'd suggest getting one because the ""morph"" function opens up the programming flexibility in performance quite a bit.For getting a start on your new Stage 3, you might find some helpful programs atnord-stage-3-programs-ns3p-ns3pb-files- ... 15748.htmlthat includes links to those above and many others. For any other programs you are looking for, I'd suggest checking the Stage 3 program forum using the search function - it works well when using a single keyword, but try variations too because the word has to be an exact match - for example, ""Dancin"" will not find anything but ""Dancing"" will bring up your post and mine. Good luck, take care.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=111607&sid=d6d60d7df92ffc51d89cdb2a501a9207#p111607

If that is not suitable for you, you can decompose it and/or edit it to your liking?Essentially, it's a two Oscillator Mono wave with Modulated filters.Great idea. Early on the album there are some parts using the square (pulse) wave and at one point the LFO on the Mod Wheel using a sawtooth or inverse sawtooth wave.  The dominant Mini Moog sound used about 27 minutes into the album is using the Classic sawtooth wave with the distinctive resonance in the decay that's also used in the synth sound 2:35. To make the sound I would suggest starting with the following:MOD ENV Section:ATTACK 0, DECAY 6-7 (see MODULATION Section for how this plays into the sound), RELEASE 6OSCILLATORS Section: CLASSIC set with SAWTOOTH, OSC 2 with SAWTOOTH +12(?)VOICE Section: MONO, GLIDE 1, UNISON Off or maybe 1FILTER Section: LP12 or LP24 (can't remember which is similar to Mini Moog), DRIVE 1, try KB TRACK offMODULATION Section:LFO AMOUNT 0, MOD ENV 10, FREQ 3, RES 6-7.  You need to play around with these settings - I describe it this way: the MOD ENV is the highest point in the filter and resonance you'll hear, and the MOD ENV DECAY setting determines how quickly that filter and resonance will drop to the FREQ setting. There are a couple places in the solos where a note is held so you hear the range of the filter decay and how quickly it decays. Working with MOD ENV, FREQ, RES, and DECAY, you should be able to get the sound you're looking for.AMP ENV Section: ATTACK 0, DECAY 7, RELEASE 5 (notes hang on a little after being released), no VELOCITY.VIBRATO Section:Set for WHLIt's a pretty clean sound, no chorus or phase shifter effects, but reverb is needed and a little echo might be nice.  I hope this helps, take care.UPDATE:Listening to this again and comparing it to my Nord, I'm having a hard time hearing whether it's sawtooth or mid-size pulse (square) wave being used (at 61, I'm thankful I'm hearing anything at all).  I tried it with OSC1 set with mid-size pulse and OSC2 set with sawtooth +12 and that sounded pretty good too.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=111379&sid=d6d60d7df92ffc51d89cdb2a501a9207#p111379

The Nord Stage 3 is what you can read from its specs and manual, it won't change. If you need more/different go for another board or be ready to get soon into the need for adding something more (a workstation?) to the NS3.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=98725&sid=65f0b4c0b29d846e952607468db131d5#p98725

I was listening to the classic ""Good Vibrations"" by the Beach Boys that has quite a few different parts throughout the song and decided to take a stab at it. Below are five separate programs to use in song mode as you step through the song. The MP3 covers the reverb B3, synth cellos with Tannerin, detuned piano, and harmonica with B3. Program 5 (not on the MP3) includes voices to layer over those singing at the end.  The Tannerin sound in Program 2 has after-touch for the vibrato, however I use the sustain pedal to hold the synth ""cello"" note so my left hand is free to use the pitch bar for the Tannerin to make it sound more like the original. Make sure you download all five programs - the text for each file describes some of the sounds captured.The programs below use all the ""stock"" samples except for my program using ""Flute.nsmp3"" in location 268; this is a great flute sample with little noise.  It doesn't matter which sample memory locations you store new samples in your Nord Stage 3, just make sure that after you load a program, that you point the Slot A and/or Slot B Synth to the correct sample in your system. For example, if you load the Flute into your sample location 280 (268 in mine), then you just need to point Slot B to 280 rather than 268.I'll revise this post as needed based on questions, so feel free to comment.Take care.BeachBoys_GoodVibrations_WannitBBBad.mp3BBGoodVibratio1W.ns3fProgram 1 - Good Vibrations - Reverb B3 and flutes(574 Bytes) Downloaded 506 timesBBGoodVibratio2W.ns3fProgram 2 - Good Vibrations - Synth Cello and Tannerin(574 Bytes) Downloaded 464 timesBBGoodVibratio3W.ns3fProgram 3 - Good Vibrations - Left hand synth and right hand honky tonk piano(574 Bytes) Downloaded 464 timesBBGoodVibratio4W.ns3fProgram 4 - Good Vibrations - B3 and Harmonica(574 Bytes) Downloaded 453 timesBBGoodVibratio5W.ns3fProgram 5 - Good Vibrations - Cello and voices(574 Bytes) Downloaded 451 timesFlute.nsmp3Programs, MP3 examples, and links to many othersnord-stage-3-programs-ns3p-ns3pb-files- ... 15748.html",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=105062&sid=538b890c0b5c6233f2df45c750670c9b#p105062

The piano filters are simple and very useful and often free up the EQ for assigning to other engines. And the synth section is so different that there is often a much more effective and simpler way to get better-sounding results than on the old machine.Another plus, of course, is that you get to know your machine much better by programming it.Of course, that's fairly easy for me to say, since I only had a few dozen sounds to rebuild.

My sub 37 moog for moog related sounds and I’ll take the one damn good thing Korg ever had , their HD1 samples and put that in my Nord .Thank you so much.

Having played a Kronos for a year, those patches - and the RH3 weighted keyboard - were the only things I really liked about the Kronos. The orchestral patches alone are worth the purchase, if you need that.I found the pianos okay, and the electric pianos didn’t touch me at all. Hated the synths and the organ. Absolutely DESPISED the interface. When I had to rebuild the backline after the guy who owned the Kronos dropped out of the project, I opted for Mainstage instead. That doesn’t really kick me in the gut, either, but at least the interface is from Apple, so I’m not hating that, and I’m WAY faster at getting what I need.The Nord is far more limited than Kronos or Mainstage, but I fall in love with the instrument all over again every day.Everything about the Stage 3 inspires me in a way the Kronos never did, and Mainstage doesn’t.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=94794&sid=b79eccfec416caa4f14e1b2b79f1e02f#p94794

It is a musical instrument. It is not intended to be a do-it-all thingamabob. What it does, it does extremely well. The strings and brass are not intended to be 100% realistic. I have 0 doubt that if Nord ever intended to do realistic strings/brass, it could absolutely provide that. But instead, Nord gives us something musical, something inspirational, something tactile and emotional, something we can connect with. Then, if you need more/different, you can supplement with a separate box/board/VST.Watch this... this is how I feel about my Nord...",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=94817&sid=b79eccfec416caa4f14e1b2b79f1e02f#p94817
