There is a setting in the MIDI menu that controls if these program changes are sent/received by the 3p, the manual says : Program Change can be set to off (of), send only (s), receive only (r) and to both send and receive (sr). set this to receive if you want to change the programs on the Nord drum 3P from a mIdI controller or a sequencer.Range: PC.Of, PC.S, PC.r, PC.SrFor Bank Select the 3p uses a combination of 2 CC messages (CC0 MSB and CC32 LSB). There is a general setting in the MIDI menu for what the 3p does with CC messages: Control Change can be set to Off, Send only, Receive only and both Send and Receive. Set this to receive if you want to change parameters on the Nord Drum 3p from a MIDI controller or a sequencer. Range: CC.Of, CC.S, CC.r, CC.Sr. Bank Select requires a pair of LSB and MSB values (Least Significant - and Most Significant Byte). Transmit the LSB value first, then the MSB value. Which values will select which bank is probably easiest to find out by monitoring what MIDI messages the 3p sends when selecting banks.Of the two, program change is the more universal in MIDI, although the reach is limited; within one bank of the 3p. Bank change requires some CC messages specific for the 3p (or Nord*), and will possibly/probably not be compatible with Bank selection in instruments of other brands, *(Nord Stage for example uses the same CC's).Cheers,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=130942&sid=e9e28c87089827f32c1c41ae7c30c65a#p130942

If such a swap is not an option, you could try to increase the channel levels of the 3p. These are set per drum channel and stored per program/kit.If you're playing a drum sequence via MIDI, send higher velocity notes. If you're playing the pads, try different velocity curves or sensitivity settings so that it becomes easier to reach higher velocity levels.

This creates a problem if you play the unit primarily with sticks or hands.  Eventually it seems the wires pull and the soldiers get weak.Thankfully my unit has been fixed and adjusted to accommodate these oversights in the construction of the production of the nord drum 3p.  We will see how long it lasts.The wires are too tight and short and over time with playing or moving around they will get weak at the solder joints.

They might mean recording the global and just seperating the toms kick and snare or whatever on different tracks and just muting the unwanted pads or erasing unwanted midi data.

UTP means it is unshielded. Maybe the category doesn’t really matter for this use, it perhaps tells you something about the age of the cable indirectly.Because you tested a couple of cables, I agree it seems to point to a problem with the port. Cleaning and checking it for physical damage makes sense, although it may be difficult to really tell, the contacts are very small to start with. There are some small structures to keep the connector in the right position, perhaps these can wear too.

My goal is to be able to play the unit with external pads, 6 external triggers (installed 3.5mm trigger inputs) so I can have Roland pads in different areas on my drum kit, or if I feel like it, plug in triggers for the bass or snare drum to trigger the Nord sounds. Pretty much making the Nord drum 3P a desktop unit.I spoke with the person who had the modification done in the attached pictures and he stated that Nord left this type of modification as a possibility in the unit. Not sure how true that is but looks to be a possibility since its been done before.Im located in EU and am willing to send within EU for this modification. Unfortunately it seems that anyone I reach out to dont want to do this mod or just dont know how to do it. But clearly its been done so its possible. Some people Ive reached out to seems to not want to drill the holes or they dont know if its even possible and some quote me the price of the modification but its as much as the unit costs. Kind of ridiculous IMHO.I cant solder and know nothing about internal electronics.Thank you!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=175721&sid=e9e28c87089827f32c1c41ae7c30c65a#p175721

These notes will have note on, and (some form of) note off messages.Step 2Now the notes are all in separate MIDI channels (step 1), have all note-on messages trigger a CC50 value 127 (longest tone decay), and CC21 value 127 (longest noise decay). Also, have note-off messages trigger CC50 value 0 and CC21 value 0. The Midihub transforms the note-on and off messages to CCs, so I have to make sure to keep the original note on messages when sending it all to the ND2/3p, luckily this is simply done by selecting 'insert' in stead of 'replace' in the editor. In my DAW I had to merge the newly generated CC messages back with the notes from step 1.-and that's it!Instead of the decay parameter, I also tried channel level, but that caused some clicking artifacts. You can of course experiment with the max and min decay values, it doesn't have to be 127 and 0.In the midihub I am using a transformer 'pipe', I bet there are MIDI plugins that can do this conversion if your DAW can't do this natively..Cheers,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=169700&sid=e9e28c87089827f32c1c41ae7c30c65a#p169700

I need to wait to weekend to get a merger then try. If this doesn't work then I will roll the dice with a MIDI ""capable"" audio looper (but they sound like a mine field).This is the only configuration I can think of that I haven't tried - so fingers crossed. Once I get a merger, I will report back so this is at least documented to help potential future frustrations as lord knows this has been a head wrench for me.Nord—MIDI OUT/Korg—MIDI OUT>>MIDI MERGER>>MIDI IN—BASTL LOOPERthenBASTL LOOPER—MIDI OUT>>MIDI THRU>>MIDI IN—Nord/MIDI IN—KorgIf this gets the Nord drum in the looping game, then I can look to incorporating this into my wider set up.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=175243&sid=e9e28c87089827f32c1c41ae7c30c65a#p175243

The merger also had a korg XD coming into merger. Then merger box out to Bastl midi in. Then Bastle Midi out into a thru box.  Thru box midi out to midi in ND3p, midi in Korg xd (at one point also tried digitakt).The weird result WAS Korg XD seemed to record on Bastl as the rec light went solid.

On the 3p's global MIDI channel you have to return exactly the same MIDI notes, otherwise no drum sounds will be triggered.-On the 3p, keep the individual MIDI channels off (or at least make sure they're not using the same MIDI channel as the global) - each drum channel is monophonic, if one drum channel receives two triggers at once via MIDI it may result in notes cutting off, or other weird stuff-Although I don't think your problem is caused by feedback, it never hurts to try this (from the Bastl looper manual): ""you can activate the MIDI feedback filter on the Midilooper. While selecting the MIDI channel on the voice that is feedbacking, press the CLEAR button. This will turn on the MIDI FEEDBACK FILTER or in other words: disable the live playback on that particular channel""-I don't think that the Bastl looper requires a MIDI clock from the MIDI input. Using either the tap tempo or free running option on the Bastl will allow you to go back to a basic MIDI setup without the MIDI merger.-In the Bastl manual they're using a separate keyboard to input notes for the loop, perhaps you should try that too to diagnose the problem: connect your keyboard to MIDI IN of the looper, the 3p to the MIDI OUT of the looper, set the looper 'voice' to MIDI channel 10. Perhaps even try to directly trigger drum sounds with the keyboard without the looper, to check if the 3p receives any MIDI notes. Remember that on the keyboard you have to play the exact notes as set in the MIDI menu of the 3p to trigger the drum sounds.-check/swap MIDI cablesGood luck!Cheers,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=175432&sid=e9e28c87089827f32c1c41ae7c30c65a#p175432

I think it is a nice and easy looper to pair with your 3p once you got this problem sorted. Check if there is a Bastl MIDI looper section on Elektronauts, or Mod Wiggler, see if other people are having similar difficulties with their looper. If you hadn't already, check this video by Bastl:On the 3p the MIDI note is set per drum channel. In the MIDI menu use the drum channel selection buttons (CH SELECT) to see the note [nt.XX] for each drum channel. Only these 6 MIDI notes will trigger the drum sounds via the global MIDI channel, any other notes will be ignored. So if the looper for example transposes all recorded notes with an octave, you won't hear any drum sounds.Also using the channel selection buttons, make sure that the individual MIDI channel is off on all 6 drum channels [Ch.OF]. The global MIDI channel [GL.10] applies to all 6 drum channels, and should correspond with the voice MIDI output channel on the looper. As advised in the Bastl video, switch local off on the 3p when it's connected to the looper [Lo.OF]. This is a global setting that will be reset (!) when you switch off the 3p. (the 'feedback filter' setting on the Bastl basically does the same.) If you happen to have a USB MIDI interface, you could check what MIDI is coming out of the looper in a DAW, or MIDI monitoring app, it may help to further diagnose the problem.Cheers,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=175483&sid=e9e28c87089827f32c1c41ae7c30c65a#p175483

I got it to trigger and played a few jams so far. My issues are these.1.   I change the length to 8 bars instead of 28 or whatever it keeps reverting back to and it seems I need to change it every time. Its very irritating. So I need to change the length every time?  And this thing cant figure out how it wants to record meaning I press record and it either does record or doesnt. Its very strange!2.   I used a midi solutions thru box. So my whole set up is midi keyboard to the midi solutions box that breaks out to my Roland sh4d then was going to add other synths and maybe other gear.  I tried to set the looper on the chain thru the midi solutions box but no dice. Kind of sucks since I dont want to have to mess with chords every time I want to mess with how its plugged in.3.   My nord drum seems to need to use both in and out puts so its permanently connected to my interfaces midi since I need to route it when recording in reaper.   Using the bastl seems to be a stand alone device and seems useless for me since I like to keep my gear plugged in and record audio and midi.4.   the bastl commands just plain f**** suck and the tutorial videos are too long and no chapters.  The manual lacks and its just more of a pain in the ass to use.   I bout this to not have to f**** with sequences in Reapers terrible piano roll for my nord 3 p but I guess thats my best option and its faster in a way.5. These toys are just pure gimmiks Ive come to realise amongst the synth community. Its all hipster money grabs and trying to solve a problem by creating more problems.6.  Im going to buy and try the retrokit midi looper. Its more expensive but it seems better with a screen and easier to use and program.7.  Im so tired of simple things being so complicated.  Its bad enough the nord drum manual sucks and the pads have shortest out on me 3 times and tonight Messi g around another pad has been acting up.  Im going to cut them off and send it to someone who modified them to inputs for external pads instead.  Im tired.Reason I got this looper is because my WHOLE intention was to be able to live play what I wanted i to a sequence and loop it.  Ive tried others and it seemed I can only play the sequences pads or whatever to trigger the nord. I want to play the nord and have it loop what I play. Not me having to plug the best in and it triggers the nord.  Annoying.  Know of anything that exists that does this and isn't the bastl or retrokits?   Im thinking midi routing in my daw is faster and way cheaper.  Cant belive this thing costs 300$.,https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=175615&sid=e9e28c87089827f32c1c41ae7c30c65a#p175615

When I press play, the first two or three notes are on time and then it begins drifting massively, by the second scene of the song everything is totally out of rhythm.

Yes 3 times.  I'll be sending it to clavia for service soon and I have read a few posts tht have the same issues. One pad craps out or triggers other pads.  This is faulty by design I think.  If you open the unit, you can see just how short the wires are from the first pads up to the circuit board.  To me this is an issue because the floating pads tug and pull on these wires and eventually shorting the connection.It's annoying as hell to have constant issues with this thing.  When I have the bass drum pedal plugged in it triggers crazy notes when recording.  I've turned the sensitivity to one and messed with the threshold to no avail....I've opted to go without the bass pad pedal entirely.I wish they would have added a hi hat trigger and a SEPARATE bass drum channel!I wish they would have released the nord drum 3 unit with 6 inputs for pads instead of the built in ones as well.  I have seen some mods with this and reached out to a guy whom did this and claims Nord has left components inside to connect jacks for each pad on the circuit board.   IF my pads go out again after the 3rd time servicing the unit, I will commission a  local metalworker and electrical synth repair man to install 1/3 jacks for each pad and have a custom metal backing to complete the unit. I'll use nice pads to replace the built in ones.  Plus the Nord pads are noisy as all hell and too clicky and loud.I have come to the conclusion this unit will be with me forever because there is no other drum synth on the market like this and I don't see anyone having balls to make one anytime soon.  And for me the ability to drum out synth stuff is invaluable, so I'm willing to modify this thing for my use only.  To hell with it.IMHO Nord has really dropped the ball here.  I would LOVE for a unit to have the ability for external pads, hi hat and bass triggers, and ALL KNOB PER FUNCTION!!!  I could live with a unit that is double thick as the current one, I don't care, as long as it has these things this unit would be the beast of synths on the market, no aceptions.

I think they had an electronic bass drum pedal in mind, to play a bass drum sound. However, drum channel 1 can be programmed to any sound you like, and you can also use any brand of pad, drum trigger, or electronic bass drum pedal you prefer, just be aware that with multi zone pads it will only use the main one, and hihat pad setups won't work as intended.If the 3p itself doesn't fit in your setup, and you want to play more than 1 drum sound on the 3p, then indeed MIDI may be a solution, in theory... You'd have to find a device with a pad, or a drum 'brain' to which you can connect several pads, that has a MIDI out port, from which the (digital) MIDI messages can be sent to the 3p. Alesis makes some small units with 4 pads, the Roland SPD-One models have one pad and MIDI out. A drum brain may also be an option, they often also have a MIDI out port.Why don't you want to play on the 3p directly live?Cheers,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=162305&sid=4e38a0bbd99e6ccd496181bae7735d5d#p162305

However, with a small mixer on stage you should be able to. I know that on Mackie mixers muted tracks are routed to the monitoring section, and when you're happy with the sound, you simply unmute the 3p on the mixer.Another simple solution: interrupt the audio path from the 3p to the main mixer/amp using a stereo line selector pedal, A/B switcher, or perhaps a stereo volume pedal.If you don't want to carry extra gear; in theory you could also use the 3p's channel panning. First, connect the L output to the main mixing desk/amp, and R to your personal monitor/headphones amp. Then, by hard panning a drum sound on the 3p, you can route it to either your headphones, or the main mixer.  However, in this way you'll in fact be using the 3p in mono. I don't think it's a very practical solution either; the panning is confusing, easily forgotten, and a bit slow. Perhaps a MIDI (foot) controller might be helpful here, but the idea was to not use any extra gear.. The only advantage of this method is perhaps that you could (potentially) audition each drum sound individually before adding it to the mix.I think a small mixer or a switching pedal are the simplest solutions in case you really need to audition kits during a gig. Personally I would only do some final tweaks during sound check and focus on playing during the gig. For jamming and experimenting perhaps consider a small MIDI controller with some knobs to control a couple of basic parameters such as channel level, (but be careful of MIDI parameter jumps)..Cheers,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=156925&sid=4e38a0bbd99e6ccd496181bae7735d5d#p156925

Yes, I tried to optimize all possible settings, a whole bunch of different sticks, etc. I loved the sounds, but I couldn't get any pleasure out of actually striking that surface. It's been years, but I remember it being a bit laborious setting up (copying, etc.) the ideal set of sounds that I liked across the 6 pads too.So I got into alternative controllers, like the Linnstrument, Roli Seaboard, etc., to add a bit of fun to my guitar playing. Those surfaces, too, have their limitations, in terms of feel.I used to own the original Roland Octapad decades ago and that had an even harder surface, out of the question for me.So, I guess it's just not possible to mimic the kind of feel that the best full sets (or actual traditional instruments) have. I tried out a bunch of electronic drums back in the day, but there was only one that felt natural to me, as far as I remember. But, of course, the full sets take up a whole lot of space and are too pricey for someone who wouldn't play them regularly, in any case.The 3p seems like it might be a little easier to set up, but I haven't gone into it in detail.Thanks again.Edit: Funny how even a few words exchanged can enliven one's interest! Yeah, I took out the ND2, after years and years (!) and the action is not quite as hard as I'd imagined. I think that the unfamiliarity of my arms striking something in that drumming motion has a lot to do with it. I'd imagine that drummers have tremendous control and nuance along that axis. For a guitar player, the picking arm action is peculiar and very different. Also, the left arm is totally unaccustomed to that kind of striking motion. So I just have to learn how to do that better. I remember taking a set of drumsticks when I was out walking, but the left arm was really uncoordinated and I gave up and got a(nother) saxophone.

If I'm not mistaken CC 70 actually controls the channel selection, so perhaps you could use that to switch the focus in the course of the track. I agree that would be quite limiting still..So, if your DAW doesn't allow to set the output MIDI channel per CC controller within the same track (I doubt if there is any DAW that is that flexible) then indeed you'll have to create a separate MIDI track for each drum sound you want to control. That makes 7 tracks in total, I agree, not ideal..However, perhaps you can use a MIDI processing tool/plugin to transform CC messages coming from your main drum track and distribute them to different drum channels. You'd start by picking your own CC numbers to use in the drum track, and with the tool/plugin transform them to the desired CC numbers and send them to the desired Individual MIDI channels of the 3p. For example: convert CC1 messages from MIDI channel 10 (drum track) to CC7 (controls channel level) on MIDI channel 1, convert CC2 on MIDI channel 10 to CC7 on MIDI channel 2, etc. etc.In this way CC1 in your drum track will control channel level of drum channel 1 of your 3p, CC2 will control channel level of drum channel 2, etc. You'll have to make a selection of parameters that you want to control, because there are only 128 CCs available in MIDI, and in this setup you're potentially using 6 CCs for each parameter that you want to control... Possibly quite a bit of work to map and configure everything, but I think it is possible..Hope this helps,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=156497&sid=4e38a0bbd99e6ccd496181bae7735d5d#p156497

Yes, I do believe their product page may be incorrect.If the Nord Drum 3P is limited to 4 FM algorithms, then so be it. Which of the original 6 algorithms were retained... the first four? Or, are the 4 algorithms on the Nord Drum 3P entirely new algorithms? I don't know. So it's difficult to say what exactly may bemissingwithout knowing what one has in the first place.For example, Yamaha's reduction of their 32 algorithm, 6 operator synths (such as the DX7) to their 8 algorithm, 4 operator synths was not necessarily a loss, since the some of their later 4 operator synths (such as the DX11) featured more than just sine waves.Reducing complexity while creating a more cohesive user interface, as seen in the evolution of the Nord Drum 2 to the Nord Drum 3P is, in my opinion, an overall good thing.

But even more so, I'd just like to have better documentation of what's actually available.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=156516&sid=4e38a0bbd99e6ccd496181bae7735d5d#p156516

The same happen if I program an eight note hi hat patterns along with some kicks and snares it just doesn't play the hi hat if there is a kick or a snare in the way.I tried this on the global channel and also send on two different individual channels. the result is the same.Basically it cannot play more than one channel at once when sequencing. This happen only when sequencing of course while I play the pads there is no such a problem.I wonder if it is a fault of the unit  or some settings are not right.

So go through all 6 drum channels with the channel selection buttons, and make sure 'Ch OF' is selected in the MIDI menu for all 6 drum channels.3) Make sure you program the drum pattern on a single MIDI track (one that uses the Global MIDI channel of the 3p as output MIDI channel) using the MIDI notes that are set in the MIDI menu of the 3p. Tip: You can record some notes on the MIDI track by playing the pads of the 3p, to see if you're using the correct MIDI notes to program the pattern with..4) It might also be your USB-MIDI interface that is causing the problem, what MIDI interface are you using to connect your 3p to your computer?Hope this helps,Cheers,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=156386&sid=4e38a0bbd99e6ccd496181bae7735d5d#p156386

I thought I'd ask here as I wasn't sure where else to go.I've been trying to set up my Nord Drum 3P to supply midi to my DAW, to play acoustic drum samples. I almost have it working, but I'm having issues. Specifically, notes sometimes (often, more often than not) don't activate, on the DAW end. Looking at a midi mapper, it seems that quite a lot of the time, I'll hit a pad and every note that's sent through is an OFF or an ON. As far as I can tell this means that it won't get picked up in the daw.This happens on two operating systems, so I'm fairly sure it's not software side. Is there some setting in the Nord I'm missing to fix this? I basically just want to know if I have a broken 3P (which would be annoying, and the 2nd one to die in a different way, and I've never used midi before with this device in the years I've owned it).Thanks for any help.EDIT: It gets weirder.

Hitting the pads right in the center also helps to prevent this, maybe tilt the unit a bit more if that makes it easier.EDIT:- I had another look at your post, in your description I count 7 different MIDI notes after 2 consecutive strokes on your 3p, unless you changed MIDI settings in the mean time, I'd expect only 6 different MIDI notes from your 3p at max, and I don't understand the Off message(s). Therefore I was wondering if your MIDI interface could be the culprit, what MIDI interface are you using?And just some general MIDI related explanation & suggestions:- The note number in the MIDI menu (nt) determines the MIDI note that the pad will output via MIDI, the pitch sound parameter only determines the pitch of the drum sound on the 3p audio output, it's important to choose a different MIDI note in the MIDI menu for each of the 6 pads..- You don't need the 'individual' MIDI channels (Ch) in this setup, you only use this functionality when you want to control the 3p's sound parameters, I think it's good practice to switch this OFF when not in use - so: set parameter Ch to value 'OF' for all 6 drum channels (pads) one by one. You could also disconnect the cable from your interface to the MIDI in of the 3p if you hadn't already. It's just to keep things as simple and tidy as possible, but I don't think it should make a difference in your current setup.Hope it helps,Cheers,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=155191&sid=4e38a0bbd99e6ccd496181bae7735d5d#p155191

Any suggestions??? One (ridiculous) thing we tried was putting the stand on top of some foam, to cut down on possible vibration, but I personally feel like...we shouldn't have to do this?Our drummer also told us that she had this issue at a venue before, so we are trying to avoid having this happen at the upcoming show.Thanks so much in advance for your time!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=153587&sid=4e38a0bbd99e6ccd496181bae7735d5d#p153587

Given your story, it's most likely triggered by sound, vibrations in the room or floor. What happens if you tap against the stand, or stamp on the floor?There are a couple of setting on the 3p that have to do with the response: pad mode, dynamic response curve, threshold, and sensitivity (see page 12 and 13 of the manual). You want toraise the thresholdto reduce unintended triggering of the pads. If it becomes unplayable, try other solutions...It could very well be the bass amp, but also acoustic drums or cymbals, which are perhaps closer to the 3p. Make sure the stand does not touch other stands or drums. You can also try changing relative positions/distances of gear on stage. If it is the bass amp, try raising it if it's standing directly on the floor. Reduce low frequencies, reduce amp volumes, play less loud.If the foam did reduce the unwanted triggering, perhaps check if there are other stands with thicker/softer rubber feet, a drum carpet/mat or riser maybe. Be careful with diy solutions, you don't want the stand to topple over!Best of luck!Cheers,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=153599&sid=4e38a0bbd99e6ccd496181bae7735d5d#p153599

But I see two different issues:a) If you play the Drum 3P directly or through another sound generator via MIDI, of course the two sound generators (built-in Nord, external) may have different volumes. So if you play a velocity of 127 on both, that may be different in volume;b) if you play a middle velocity value, that may differ even if full velocity is the same on both sound generators, as the velocity curve may not be the same. That's what we always encounter on Nord keyboards - even if Nord approached the velocity curve to a standard curve recently. If you have to deal with that, you may connect a MIDI velocity converter in between. Or have a look into your DAW if you can convert velocity values inside.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=152569&sid=4e38a0bbd99e6ccd496181bae7735d5d#p152569

This made it so that my live playing was of equal volume to my recorded midi tracks (kick etc.). It was all 4db quieter, but at least consistent.I hate having Local Off because now the entire front panel only responds to midi. You can't even change drum kits!From here you could set the ND to send Program change, and make sure your Daw loops that back, but I never have my hardware send program changes because depending on what you have focussed in Logic, changing a patch on your hardware synth can swap out a plug-in or cause other mayhem. It's just not good for my workflow.So I set Local back on, and made sure my Daw wasn't looping back midi data, which is when I realizedit had been doing that previously. The Nord doesn't have a 'through' capability. So if you have your Daw looping back midi data you won't get the usual midi-loop madness other gear exhibits. But with Local ON, what you do get is double triggered sounds! With most gear this would be a noticeable flam, but the latency on the ND must be phenomenal, because it wasn't flams, it was just louder. This explains how full velocity from live vs recorded midi could be different in volume, the live playing always had double triggered notes, doubled by a hair.So now I have Local ON and can switch kits to audition different sounds quicker, and I have my Daw never looping back incoming midi, so only the recorded tracks come back to the ND.

Nord Beat does not record MIDI, you can only enter a pattern of notes on the iPad screen, but there are other apps that will record and loop, I would first explore which apps would suit your needs, watch a lot of Youtube demo's and tutorials, an iPad is great but I wouldn't buy it just for that purpose. Also check compatibility of older iPads with current iPadOS, I'm on an iPad Air 2 from 2014, still fast enough for a lot of stuff, but they will possibly drop support and no longer provide this model with OS updates next year, which means less and less (new) apps will be compatible in the years that follow.Cheers,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=130806&sid=4e38a0bbd99e6ccd496181bae7735d5d#p130806

When I recorded into a single global channel before, the sound DID shift though depending what pad I hit (and then played everything back with the sound allocated to pad 1), so I can understand what you mean.Changing the pitch to the lower 15 notes was not applicable for me as especially the high hats and stuff are often in a range of a pitch of 80-110.Another things I was worried about was a MIDI loop, btw, so I expected that changing the channel 16 note to channel 10, then leading it into my sequencer that goes back into the Nord MIGHT create an infinite loop or at least a slight echo.

When using the individual MIDI channels, both the MIDI note that you send to the 3p, and the Tone pitch parameter determine the pitch of the drum sound. You can use this feature to play melodies on a single drum channel. Only if you send MIDI note 60, you will hear the original programmed pitch of the Tone pitch parameter. If you set the Tone pitch parameter to 60, the pitch will correspond to the MIDI note that the 3p receives (a C triggers a C, etc).However, -and I think this explains your observations- if your 3p receives back the notes via the loop* that includes your MIDI transformation then I'd expect it to behave as you descibe it: you'll hear the same pitch while playing live or recording as when playing back the recording. But if you then disconnect all MIDI, I'd expect the pitch of some of the drum channels to be lower.*Normally I'd say this requires to have Local Off on the 3p, but the incoming note apparently overrides (cuts off) the original note that was triggered internally quickly enough to not hear it.Btw, I actually never tested the method of MMS-Nord, so I decided to do so now, I was surprised to find out that it doesn't seem to work on my ND2 (OS3.0) either, notes are still only sent on the Global MIDI channel, whatever other MIDI settings and configurations I try..Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=143231&sid=4e38a0bbd99e6ccd496181bae7735d5d#p143231

The use of CC’s also make it extremely good fun with Spectra / Decay and Reverb send. As there is no MIDI Thru on the 3p, and the Digitakt doesn’t send MIDI Clock on its Thru output (3p is using MIDI out), the only choice was to make the MPC the master, Digitakt the slave to play the 3p by playing to the MPC midi clock.

The only way to find out what is sent to the 3p is to route the MIDI back to the interface and monitor or record it, with MIDI monitoring software you should be able to see individual messages with a time stamp, like note on, note off, CCs etc. If you compare that with the messages sent by the MPC whilst playing the pads (which doesn't cause the note following behavior) you should be able to find out if there is a difference.As for your goal of controlling individual drum sounds: why not try to use the Individual MIDI channels of the 3p? Problem perhaps then is that you'd have to find a way to select which channel you want to edit, maybe you can set something up in Ableton to select the MIDI channel with the pads on your controller?I don't understand why this following behavior depends on the CC settings, strange.Cheers,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=147411&sid=4e38a0bbd99e6ccd496181bae7735d5d#p147411

By triggering the drum sounds via the global MIDI channel, the drum sounds will always have the pitch as you programmed them.When you send MIDI CCs on the global MIDI channel to control drum sound parameters, only the drum sound that is currently selected will be affected, but as reverb and delay are global effects, I think you should be able to control them using the Global MIDI channel, and regardless of which drum channel is selected.Cheers,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=141947&sid=4e38a0bbd99e6ccd496181bae7735d5d#p141947

That's fantastic!I've been messing with samplers, and more recently, the Nord Drum synths to add electronic sounds to my kit. Along the way I've been using homemade triggers, enjoying the flexibility of own designs and the endless tinkering. Right now my design uses repurposed electrical switch boxes for trigger housing, strapped to a scrap 1x3. It's gnarly looking, but works 85% of the time. I just sat down to make a more professional trigger pad and thought I'd see how difficult it would be to make use of the Ethernet cable on the ND2, and came across this.SO, that's great that it's possible. For an amateur like me, do you have any instruction/advice/etc on how to connect the Ethernet cable to 6 drum triggers? I have the piezoelectric components ready to go, I'm going to get started on building the housing for the pad itself today. Any help would be appreciated, I'd love to use 1 cable instead of the 6 I currently have being vomitted out the side of my briefcase-pedalboard.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=72162&sid=a9e87c0cc907b8a9caa7b75bda161b7b#p72162

Inside the Pad there are two amplifier chips (Z974 see data sheethttps://www.ti.com/lit/ds/slos467h/slos467h.pdf). You don't necessarily need this voltage, as without a power supply the output from the pads will still come out from wires #1-6, as long as you wire up all the triggers to the shared neutral #8. If your drum module is able to respond to the low voltage output without amplification you'll be fine without the amplifier chips and won't need to wire up #7.If you do need amplification, you probably won't need much voltage. The Z974 chips are rated 2.7V - 15V for their input voltage but I found I was able to get a good signal boost just from a minimal voltage. I found the chips heat up with a higher voltage so it'd be best to use the minimum voltage you need to trigger your module adequately. When I wire everything up properly I will try installing two AAA batteries (3V) but you could also power by USB (5V).I don't have access to a Nord Drum 2 so I don't know what voltage it outputs as standard.The Nord Drum 2 is hard to find, even second-hand, but I was able to buy a Nord Pad brand new on clearance. So if you're willing to do a basic bit of electronics to wire it up, the Nord Pad is still an attractive and probably cheap option.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=136055&sid=a9e87c0cc907b8a9caa7b75bda161b7b#p136055

Unless you want to control sound parameters with CCs, it’s best to leave the individual MIDI channels off [Ch.OF].The individual MIDI channels can be used to control sound parameters of the 6 channels of your 3P. And also allow you to play melodies, because MIDI notes that are sent to an individual MIDI channel will now control the pitch of the Tone section of the 3P.Example of CC control: Let’s say you created a snare sound on channel2, and you have a beat programmed on your sequencer. And now you want to gradually change the noise filter settings of the snare during the song. On channel2 select individual MIDI channel 2, find the right CC for noise filter in the manual, then program your sequencer to send the CC to MIDI channel 2 for the filter sweep, while the drum pattern itself is sent to MIDI channel 10 (global channel)Example of melodies: let’s say you created a xylophone sound on channel1, and selected individual MIDI channel 1 for that channel. If you now let your sequencer or keyboard send notes to MIDI channel 1 you will hear your xylophone sound playing the melody.. Remember: each of the 6 channels is monophonic, if you want to play chords on your synthetic xylophone, copy the same xylophone sound to the other channels, but use a different individual MIDI channel for each. Send the individual notes of the chord to these individual MIDI channels.In conclusion, for drum patterns, it’s easiest to use the global MIDI channel + the note numbers as set in the MIDI menu. It’s best to keep the individual MIDI channels off, unless you want to control the parameters of the individual sounds, or play melodies. And if you use them, in most cases you want to make sure that the individual MIDI channels are different from each other, - but always make sure the individual MIDI channels are all different from the global MIDI channel!Cheers,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=99171&sid=a9e87c0cc907b8a9caa7b75bda161b7b#p99171

Only use the global channel if you do not wish to send CC messages to the pad as it will have some interesting results but will probably not just cause more headaches.For more control over each pad set each pad to have it's own midi channel (in the midi settings use ChX to set each pads midi channel, cycle through the individual pads by using the channel select buttons near the top of the pad).I like to use midi channels 1-6 for each pad, I'll only use the global midi channel if I don't want to mess around with the individual pads sounds.Don't forget, to activate the CC controls from the OT you need to hold function and click the relevant encoder to turn it on, this kept causing me frustration when I forgot about it. Also, some CC messages can only be received over global channel such as delay rate and a a few others that affect all pads.Also, when using individual midi channels for each pad the default pitch is D4, the OTs default note value is set to C4 so if your programmed drums sound different to when you play the pad, that's possibly why.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=124562&sid=a9e87c0cc907b8a9caa7b75bda161b7b#p124562

MIDI clock is transmitted without a MIDI channel, all instruments in the chain will receive the same clock. I think the BPM of the delay of the 3p can be synced to a sequencer in this way, not 100% sure though.There is no digital or analog audio passed through with MIDI. So if you want to apply audio effects on the Nord Drum 3p sounds with the deep6, or minibrute 2s, you need to route the audio from the 3p outputs to the inputs of the deep6 and/or minibrute, using instrument (jack-jack) cables.Your MIDI setup seems correct to control both deep6 and 3p with the minibrute 2s, to prevent that both deep6 and 3p respond to the same MIDI instructions, choose a different MIDI channel for each of the 2 instruments, I don't know the sequencing capabilities of the minibrute 2s.Hope this helps,Cheers,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=120112&sid=30e17c45c86817b66111dd842cd5bd1f#p120112

No audio will be transmitted over that device.If you want to record audio, you have to use/buy an (external)audio interface.Check this videofor an explanation......and then check theFAQon that:How can I record my Nord into any/a daw?This depends what you would like to record:MidiMIDI has nothing to do with audio. It is ONLY the information about what is played and when, but there is no sound transfer. It is to audio as Sheet music is to a CD. Sheet music contains all the information about what’s on the CD, but it doesn’t contain any sound itself (as said by Analogika).When recording midi (notes) you will need to connect your Nord to your Mac/PC with an USB cable or MIDI interface using the MIDI DIN connection. Depending on the Nord model, it's supporting MIDI over USB (or not). In the DAW (of your choice) you have to create a MIDI channel strip and configure it to listen for MIDI data on the configured MIDI port.AudioAudio can be recorded on your Mac/PC using the onboard microphone connection (not recommended) or an audio interface (external audio card). You have to connect the L/R audio output of your Nord device to this audio interface. In the DAW (of your choice) you have to create a AUDIO channel strip and configure this to the configured audio input on your audio interface where you Nord instrument is connected to.Gr Bart",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=117101&sid=30e17c45c86817b66111dd842cd5bd1f#p117101

It lasts for whatever reverb time you've chosen. When zero reverb is set, the sound is perfectly clean.It's a thin hissing noise that decays in a kind of dirty grainy crackle.(Like you deliberately wanted to add some cheesy vintage noise to an otherwise clean reverb)The hiss doesn't seem to be connected to any particular sound. It always does whatever the reverb does.The noise is not dynamic. Means, no matter how softly I hit the pad, the hiss comes with it's full volume.It is especially recognisable on small in-ear headphones, that exaggerate high fequencies.And obviously when high frequencies are pushed in EQ and/or compressed in a recording mix.Didn't try it on a clean sine wave yet.If I wouldn't know better, I'd say it's just a really cheap reverb, but besides the hiss the reverb operates really well.I recieved the 3P with latest firmware (1.24 already on board.) so I don't know about any other versions.And yes, I did contact Clavia Support via email on monday, haven't heard from them yet.I really hope this get's fixed, because, despite other minor shortcomings, this little thing sounds simply awesome andI would hate to see it send back.Do you relay any information to Clavia, by chance or do you know, if any Clavia techs visit this place every once in while?Cheers,Falko",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=84286&sid=30e17c45c86817b66111dd842cd5bd1f#p84286

So it is there but it is very very quiet, much better than the headphone output.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=84401&sid=30e17c45c86817b66111dd842cd5bd1f#p84401

Anyone else experiences this?2)The noise present when the reverb is on, even in its lowest settings. The sound is clear when reverb is off, so in theory I can run the signal through my effect pedals instead, but then I lose the per-pad adjustment. I hadn't read this thread before getting my unit, and the noise behavior is exactly as you previously described and in the musicnstuff.de article, so it's not just a random thing.What surprises me is that this is very noticeable on the factory banks, so Clavia must be aware of it.

The noise is not too loud but when I put the track in my DAW to 0db I can hear that clearly. I have a Nord Rack 2x and it has not noise at all, the output is really clear in that case. Its not related to the main volume level, because if y turn the volume all way down the noise is gone. And I also found a second noise problem in the reverb!! the reverb had a kind of noise on it which has been described here by other users. My unit is on firmware 1.24I think that this kind of problem is not aceptable from a high range musical product from a company as Clavia, although the noise is not very loud it´s noticeable in studio environment.I will try to return this product if its posible and get my money back, I don´t want another Nord Drum 3 because as i read here this is not the only unit affected by this problem. It may be a general bad design on this device, it´s such a shame because the sound and overall quality is very good but this issue ruins the whole instrument (at least for me, maybe it could be usefull for somebody who only want the nord drum to play live)Best regards and sorry for my poor english.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=86563&sid=30e17c45c86817b66111dd842cd5bd1f#p86563

I will try to do so here.To recap, I identify three problems:Issue 1:The constant hiss of the headphone output. The hiss begins when the unit is turned on, irrespective of settings, and does not respond to the master volume level. It is just there, constant and ever-present. In contrast, the line outputs in my unit are clean.Issue 2:The noise present when any type of reverb is on, even on its lowest settings. The crackling noise will begin immediately when the pads are hit, and it decays slower than the reverb trail. The sound from the line outputs is otherwise crystal clear when the reverb is off.Description of attached examples:These non-dithered .wav files were recorded directly in my Focusrite Scarlett 6i6, straight from the line outs. I made sure that the volume settings on the unit was around 3/4th of max, and the interface preamp levels low (2/5ths of their range), making sure there was no clipping or distortion occurring. I used the factory preset of pad 4, in Drum Kit A1.Nord3P_NoReverb.wavA high-velocity hit, with the reverb turned off. To my ears, it is crystal-clear.(750.04 KiB) Downloaded 367 timesNord3P_Reverb.wavA high-velocity hit, with the reverb turned on, to the default type (P3) and value of 9 (out of 50). Might be hard to hear the noise, but should become obvious in higher volumes.(1.46 MiB) Downloaded 336 timesNord3P_Reverb_LowVelocity.wavA low velocity hit, same settings as in file 2.(1.78 MiB) Downloaded 270 timesNord3P_Reverb_LowVelocity_boost.wavSame as file 3, but with a +12 db boost in its channel in Ableton. Turning the volume up, you should be able to hear how bad the S/N ratio actually is, and how long the decay of the noise.(1.78 MiB) Downloaded 288 timesIssue 3:The reverb in general accumulates a lot of hiss and noise in some patches, to an unacceptable degree in some cases. Here is the description of a patch demonstrating this:Noise levels set to 0. Click levels set to 0. In the Tone section, set Wave to D2, Freq to 0, Decay to 36, Bend to 26, Time to 50 and Pitch set to 70.6. Distortion, EQ, Delay, and all effects turned off. Reverb type set to Hall, and value 20.I attach sounds of the patch with and without reverb. For comparison, I also ran the dry signal through the hall algorithm of my TC Electronics HoF reverb pedal at maximum decay time, levels and tone.Nord3P_Patch_NoReverb.wav(2.01 MiB) Downloaded 298 timesNord3P_Patch_Reverb.wav(2.31 MiB) Downloaded 308 timesNord3P_Patch_HoF.wav(3.39 MiB) Downloaded 265 timesThe bottom line is:Can you verify that you experience the same problems or that you can replicate the noise described here and demonstrated in the attached examples?

When I hear the six recorded tracks I get a really noisy result that you can listen to here(just cranck the volume up and enjoy). So if I record 6 tracks (one per channel) this is what I get---.

If it's the same, alter the note set for pad #10.If that wasn't the problem, I wonder if the MIDI output channel can be set per pad on the E2..If so, check if the MIDI output channel of pad #10 is different than the rest, change it, and/or do the following:On the ND2 switch off all the inividual MIDI channels; for each channel find this parameter under MIDI settings, and make sure they're all set to [Ch.OF] (unless you really want to use this feature to eg adjust parameters, note pitches per Channel)The velocity curve/sensitivity/threshold settings on the ND2 only apply for drum pads connected directly to the ND2,It must be on the E2 side, also a MIDI setting perhaps, -but are the pads velocity sensitive to start with?Hope this helps..Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=75125&sid=30e17c45c86817b66111dd842cd5bd1f#p75125

So it is not a reference to that drum sound in the drum banks but a copy, that you can then use and/or freely edit.-The drum bank is a pool of both factory and user made drum sounds. It makes it easy to reuse a drum sound in other drum kits. I usually start new drum sounds from scratch, but when I want to reuse a drum sound on the ND2, I have to go to the drum kit that has that specific sound, press copy, go all the way back to the kit I was working on and press paste. With the 3p you can do the same, but it is much easier to store drum sounds that you really like into the drum banks for later use.-When you press the 'select drum' button, the 3p waits until you rotate the dial to select a drum sound from the drum banks that will replace the drum sound that is currently in the channel of the drum kit you're in.-The 3p does not keep track from which drum bank a drum sound in a kit originated, partly because you are free to completely alter the sound once it is in the channel of the kit. If you are unhappy with the editting you did on the sound, you can always recall the original from the drum bank.Hope this answered your question..Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=107341&sid=30e17c45c86817b66111dd842cd5bd1f#p107341

There is a work-around for your setup though. Any app, DAW plugin or hardware MIDI processor that can filter out notes or create a 'keyboard split' can be used to pass only the MIDI note from one drum channel to your Volca Kick.I was able to set up a filter with iOS app 'Midiflow', so that it only let through note C3, all other notes were ignored. If you happen to have an iOS device and a USB-MIDI interface, ..The Digital Music Corp MX-8 that Pablo mentioned in another thread here on the forum, is able to setup 'keyboard splits'; ranges of notes can be routed to different MIDI channels. The MX-8 is no longer produced, perhaps to be found on e-bay.The 'MIDI Platform' by Future Artists will be able to do it, but it may take a while before they will start selling them..The MIDI Solutions Event Processor (/Plus) is perhaps able to do it but it's not compatible with Nord keyboards and probably not with drums either.Cheers,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=112280&sid=30e17c45c86817b66111dd842cd5bd1f#p112280

I don't have a Mac, no experience with Ableton, so I cannot help you.Just some general tips/remarks:-Your USB-MIDI interface ('cable') is a MIDI device, I think in Ableton you should be able to select it and use the same MIDI channel as in the app, so that's probably MIDI channel 10 if you didn't change anything on the 3p.-The 3p (only) outputs the 6 notes as set in the MIDI settings, so if you want to control sounds or trigger other stuff by playing the pads, check the note numbers that Ableton receives, couple them to whatever you want to trigger.-If you want to use the 3p as sound module, send the mentioned notenumbers on MIDI channel 10Hope this helps,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=111074&sid=30e17c45c86817b66111dd842cd5bd1f#p111074

Perhaps try another MIDI port, the interface is preferably directly connected to your computer.

They can be ""additional"" sounds to the ones I am alreadyusing on the 6 pads, right? ( I hope.)No, if you are using a drum set with for example: bassdrum, snare, hi-hat, and 3 toms, you can't play other sounds with MIDI than these (eg add crash sounds). However, with the right MIDI settings you can play the same sounds with a different pitch, which in this example might be interesting for the tom sounds. With a kit composed of: bassdrum, snare, hi-hat, one tom, and 2 crashes, you would still be able to play multiple tom pitches.If you program a simple snare + bassdrum loop with the Nord Beat app, you can still play the kit yourself, even add extra snare or bassdrum notes in between the notes that are triggered with the app.Falkom wrote:And will an incoming trigger signal cut off a long reverb or delay ""tail"" that has been playing on theidentical channel? Or would it just replace the actual sound but not the effect tail.Not sure, I think the reverb is an effect that behaves just like an external reverb (but dry/wet can be set per channel) so I don't think the reverb tail is cut by new notes. The delay might be different, I only know that the delay on the Nord drum2 was similar to a MIDI delay, not sure how it works on the Nord drum3p.Cheers,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=84115&sid=30e17c45c86817b66111dd842cd5bd1f#p84115

It is actually explained in the manual, but for some reason I just skipped over the MIDI chapter without paying attention...The way I see this, it opens up a lot of possibilities, not just the extra toms. Some additional ideas:1) Have a simple step sequencer, e.g. Beatstep or SQ-1 play a melodic sequence using a tuned percussion sound on one channel of the 3P. Play on top of the sequence on the remaining five pads.2) With a more capable sequencer, e.g. Beatstep Pro, play two different melodic sequences simultaneously or alternately, using two different tuned percussion sounds on two different channels of the 3P. The sequencer can then simultaneously play a drum track on the remaining four channels of the 3P.3) Set up the 3P together with a controller keyboard, five channels for playing drums, and the last channel for playing a tuned percussion sound chromatically with the keyboard. Many cheap controller keyboards even have a simple arpeggiator built in, so that could be used to lay down a simple melodic sequence or drum track, depending on the setup....etc.!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=111240&sid=30e17c45c86817b66111dd842cd5bd1f#p111240

With the app you can't record MIDI notes that you play on your 3p live, but a pattern is setup in no time, and adapted quickly.. The disadvantage of a MIDI solution may be that it triggers notes on the Nord Drum, leaving perhaps a little less room (polyphony) for live playing the Nord Drum yourself on top of the loop, depending how many notes and channels you use for the loop/pattern. There is no sound degradation though as each note is produced by the Nord Drum itself. The other advantage is that the loop will be very accurate, no timing errors.With a looping pedal you can record audio from your 3p, and then loop it, you can start and stop recording, and in this way determine the length of the loop, all with your foot. The disadvantage is that it may require some skill to make a good and working loop without timing errors. The advantage is that you can layer and go beyond the polyphony /the 6 voices of the Nord Drum, and you are fully free to play any notes on top of the loop. I don't know the audio quality of these pedals though.Cheers,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=86114&sid=30e17c45c86817b66111dd842cd5bd1f#p86114

A piezo can produce high voltages for a very brief time, I don't know the voltages a drum pad normally outputs. It is possible to trigger the ND with a Beatstep Pro (BSP) which 'only' outputs 3V. The shape and duration of the signal also matters; a long pulse or 'gate trigger' from the BSP triggers the ND twice: at the start and again at the end of the pulse. To prevent this double triggering they use the shortest pulse possible on the BSP (not sure how short this is) or envelope generators to create a spike like signal.Some links to threads in MuffWiggler that may help:https://www.muffwiggler.com/forum/viewt ... highlight=https://www.muffwiggler.com/forum/viewt ... sc&start=0Hope this helps,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=110198&sid=30e17c45c86817b66111dd842cd5bd1f#p110198

If the threshold is too high, it won't respond to your hands tapping the pads. Therefore I would just start by lowering the threshold quite a bit and raising the sensitivity.Then check the cable: it should be easier to trigger the Nord drum with a stick than with your hands, do the channel lights light up when you hit the pads with a stick? If not, perhaps the cable is bad or unsuitable, or one of the ports is dirty or broken (which I doubt), inspect the ports, try another Cat6 cable..If you do see the lights blinking I would expect the ND2 to output MIDI notes, did you check this with MIDI monitor software? If you don't hear anything when you do see the lights blinking, it could be that Local is off in the MIDI settings, turn Local On.Optimizing the sensitivity, threshold and dynamics response curve setting to your playing style may take some time, I find the manual quite helpful on pages 25 and 26. Just one remark: you may experience spontaneous triggering with too low threshold settings, and cross talk between pads with too high sensitivity settings. It's also worthwhile to experiment with the various dynamic response curves, some will make it easier to reach higher velocities, others quite the opposite.Hope this helps,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=110053&sid=30e17c45c86817b66111dd842cd5bd1f#p110053

The default factory settings are:  Global MIDI channel = 10, MIDI note 60 (central C) is coupled to channel1 (I do not mean MIDI channel1, but the sound or pad on the 3p), note 62 is coupled to channel2, note 64 to 3, note 65 to 4, note 67 to 5, note 69 to 6. That’s 6 white keys of a keyboard, C3 and up (or C4 depending on if you’re on the Roland or Yamaha standard). On the 3p these notes can be set in the MIDI settings, looks something like this: [n.60]. So if there is a bass drum sound on channel1, and you send a central C on MIDI channel 10, you will hear a bass drum. Make a drum pattern using these 6 notes. If you send any other notes to the 3p, nothing will happen, no sound. The pitch of the sounds will exactly be as you programmed them, and as can be heard when playing the pads themselves.The individual MIDI channels can be used to control all sound parameters with MIDI CC messages, if you send MIDI notes on an individual MIDI channel, the MIDI note number will here control the pitch of the Tone section. In that way you can play melodies using one channel, handy for tuned percussion sounds eg marimba, only with one channel! Sending note 60 will result in the original pitch (of the Tone sectionj, notes above or below will result in a higher or lower pitch. Remember that each channel of the 3p is monophonic. To avoid problems, never use the MIDI channel that is already used as global MIDI channel. For example if the global MIDI channel = 10 [GL.10] use MIDI channel1 through 6 for the individual MIDI channels: [Ch. 1], [Ch. 2] etcHope this helps..Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=105915&sid=30e17c45c86817b66111dd842cd5bd1f#p105915

All the individual parts MIDI channels are set to off so I'm exclusively using the drums on channel 10. I have a mapping in my hardware sequencer (I'm using an SL MKIII from Novation) for the Nord drum again this is set to MIDI channel 10 so I can automate and control the sound engine with the mapping and change sounds to edit them with ch select switches this is all working fine. However......I'm finding that all CC messages regardless of MIDI channel are controlling the ND3P's first part (maybe I should call it drum 1 from now on.... basically the one that is usually a kick in the kits). Again this is even after making sure that drum 1 has it's own MIDI channel set to off.It's basically like there is a bleed through of MIDI CC data onto drum 1 regardless of the MIDI channel I'm using.Eg i set global MIDI channel to 10 and individual MIDI channels for all 6 drums to off, then move a CC on say MIDI channel 1 or 2.... or indeed any channel and it affects the 1st drum part.I would have expected that CC sent only on MIDI channlel 10 would affect drum 1 when set up this way.Is this usual behaviour? it certainly seems a bit strange.

The TapKAT Trigger Footswitch is just a footswitch with built-in cable, but can trigger at a fixed velocity.I don't know how that is possible, though.

I will be standing up when playing, so I won't be able to nuance my footwork anyway. It's a problem to get hold of the TapKAT in Europe, though. The shipping cost is as much as the pedal itself, so the total cost including import tax and fees would end up around 150€! I might go to the U.S. sometime next year, in which case I will buy it then.But for now, I think I will have to make something myself. The piezo is not really working out for me, I have to wear shoes with hard soles (which I never do) and bang it really hard (even with Pad Sens at max). Still, sometimes it doesn't trigger, and that is simply too unreliable to use on stage. I have tried two different stomp boxes, one from Ortega and one from Logjam, both where unreliable.I need something like the TapKAT, so I was thinking it might be possible to retrofit a regular footswitch, e.g. the Boss FS-5U, so that it sends a fixed voltage from a button battery or something. I would then use the Pad Sense to adjust to the actual velocity according to style etc. Do you think that would be possible? How would I find out the voltage needed to trigger the 3P? I did not find any specifications in the manual or on the Nord site...Or is there maybe some other better/easier/cheaper way of doing this, i.e. using some kind of simple MIDI trigger (I haven't found any on the internet)? Maybe there is some device that can ""translate"" a signal from a footswitch into a MIDI note on/off signal? I found the MIDI Solutions Footswitch To MIDI Controller, but it's pretty expensive.I am frustrated that the 3P does not have an option to use a regular footswitch as kick trigger (unlike many other electronic drums).

Lower than that will make kick trigger by itself constantly (sounds like a machine gun).-Sensitivity 20-Dynamics Offset 2.-Pad Mode Type does not seem to make a difference.The kick has a uniform velocity because of the dynamics, but often it will not trigger 4-5 beats in a row. I get the best results with the Ortega Annalog, sometimes it will only miss triggering once in an 8 bar period, still too many for live use, though. And it has to be on a completely flat surface, completely unmoveable. Also I have to hit dead center with a fairly consistent and firm force every time (best if I use the heel). Difficult to recreate in a live setting... :-/For now, I will just play the 3P without a pedal. Then maybe have the kick come from a backing track or something, I don't know yet. Somtime in the future I will look for an electronics wizard that can make a pedal for me, if I don't get to the US before that and buy the TapKAT.

You have to create a MIDI track, not an audiotrack, but how to do that and how it's called in Garageband I don't know. However, I looked on the internet if it is possible to send MIDI from Garageband back to external instruments (in your case the 3p), apparently it isnot. So you can record MIDI from an external keyboard or drum pad onto a MIDI track, but only to play sounds from Garageband itself..So the best advice I can give you is to search for Garageband forums or tutorials on the internet to double check, because perhaps I'm wrong.. Or look for another MIDI sequencer / DAW for your Mac. Perhaps someone else here can help you with that, I'd suggest Logic, but that might be a bit expensive...I can help you with the MIDI settings of the 3p.. for most common uses you shouldnotturn the Global MIDI channel off, so [GL.10] is ok, leave it like that. Use MIDI channel 10 as your MIDI track output channel. In most cases you won't need the Individual MIDI channels, best to switch them off [Ch.OF].. (or at least pick different MIDI channels than the Global, and also choose unique MIDI channels, so all different from each other, but I would leave them off for now).Cheers,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=107222&sid=30e17c45c86817b66111dd842cd5bd1f#p107222

The pattern you recorded consists of these 6 different notes only. Example, let’s say note 60 (C4) is coupled to channel1, if you send note 60 to the 3p on the Global MIDI channel, you will hear whatever is programmed on channel1, eg. a bass drum, note 62 a snare etc..Explanation of what goes wrong..The individual MIDI channels can indeed be used to control sound parameters, but it is important to know that if you send a MIDI note to an individual MIDI channel, a sound will be triggered on the channel(s) of the 3p that you coupled to that MIDI channel. The MIDI note number will here control the pitch of the Tone section. If you’re using the same MIDI channel as the Global MIDI channel for one or more Individual channels, sending one of the notes as set in the MIDI menu [n.XX] will cause a problem; each channel of the 3p is monophonic, and you’re sending two notes to one channel at the same time.. Therefore, if you want to use Individual MIDI channels, avoid using the same MIDI channel as the global MIDI channel.. so if the global MIDI channel is 10 [GL.10], never use MIDI channel 10 for one of the individual MIDI channels [Ch.XX].Setting up the Nord Drum Individual MIDI channels [Ch.XX] for CC controlIf you want to control the same parameter(s) of all drum sounds at the same time, select the same MIDI channel as Individual MIDI channel for each of the 6 channels, but don’t use the same MIDI channel as the Global MIDI channel, and don’t use it to send MIDI notes to the 3p, unless you want all channels to be triggered at the same time. If you want to control sound parameters of individual drum sounds, choose a different MIDI channel for each, eg. MIDI channel 1 for channel1, MIDI channel 2 for 2, etc, but again, avoid the MIDI channel that is used as Global MIDI channel. Also, do not forget to allow the 3p to receive CC in the MIDI menu..Setting up CubaseIn Cubase you will need to create at least one extra MIDI track for automation, because you’re going to send the CC’s on a different MIDI channel than the Global MIDI channel. And depending how many sounds you want to control individually, you’ll need to add more tracks, so up to 6 additional MIDI tracks for automation. Make sure the MIDI out channel for each track corresponds to the Individual MIDI channel as set on the Nord drum. If you want to have the recorded notes in the MIDI track that you’re using to control parameters of a sound, move (not copy) the notes that correspond to that drum sound (eg all D4 notes) from the recorded track to the new track. In the new track you can now also change/vary the pitch of the drum sound by moving the notes up/down, if you want to keep the original pitch of the drum sound, place the notes on C4.I hope this helps,Cheers,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=103885&sid=ec0e1bafa5386a4e1d17e223eff13850#p103885

The best to work with the ND2, that is. I've used and fancied Patterning from day one but the new version will expand the possibilites with the ND2 big time. There'll be full MIDI CC mapping (this is limited in Patterning 1) where all externally controllable parameters on the ND2 will be easily accesible, all this on a very intuitive and imo easy to use UI. And there's many more new features. Like I said to Patterning's dev, now it feels like I have a new drum machine at hand.Also, I started experimenting with driving the ND2 with Patterning AND sending trigger inputs to one or more of channels from my euroracks or banana modulars.

Usually you will stumble upon some interesting other sounds in the process, you can always keep those as well, and before you know it, you have a complete bank full of sounds that you created yourself! Another good way to start is scanning through the factory banks, to see if anything comes close, start tweaking from there.

Then still it depends on the headphones you are using, and there are some settings that may help to increase the level,Some thoughts /ideas:-needless to say, open headphones will not help, some closed models reject sounds from the outside world better than others,-low impedance (lower than 50 ohms or so) headphones do not seem to work well with the Nord drum2, at least that was my impression after reading some of the postshere, not sure about the 3p. Very high impedance headphones will (in general) also get you a lower sound output. My 250 ohms DT-770 headphones work great with my Nord drum2, the combination could destroy my ears if I crank up the output to max. At reasonable levels I still hear the sticks hitting the pads, depending a bit on the drum sound and my playing style, I can live with it.-did you try different sticks, tip shapes and other types of wood?Settings that might help:-You can set the level of each channel (drum sound) - perhaps they are low, / you can increase them-Try to experiment with sensitivity settings & dynamic curves of the pad(s) - maybe you want the Nord drum to be slightly more responsiveBe careful with your ears, enjoy playing!Cheers,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=100629&sid=ec0e1bafa5386a4e1d17e223eff13850#p100629

If you prefer playing the pads to create this pattern, connect MIDI out of the Nord drum to a MIDI input on an interface. The drum pattern will be recorded on the MIDI track in Logic.-Connect MIDI out of the interface to the MIDI in of the Nord Drum, if you play back the MIDI recording, the beat will be played by the Nord Drum. If you want, you can still quantize notes and change velocity values in Logic, or pick a different kit on the Nord drum, that is one of the advantages of recording MIDI.-You can indeed control the sound parameters with MIDI (Nord Drum2 and 3p only), by setting up an ‘individual’ MIDI channel for each sound. Then setup a MIDI track for each to program/record the ‘control changes’ you want to send to the Nord Drum.-if you’re satisfied with the result, you can record the audio from the Nord drum onto an audio track in Logic.Hope this answered some of your questions,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=100039&sid=ec0e1bafa5386a4e1d17e223eff13850#p100039

You can record these notes on a (one) MIDI track in Logic. Each pad (sound) is coupled to one MIDI note number, so the MIDI recording will consist of these notes only.If you want to record the Nord Drum in one take, and then want to edit the audio for each drum sound seperately you will have to be a bit creative, because unfortunately the Nord Drum 2 and 3p only have 2 audio outputs (left and right). Therefore I think you should start by recording your session on a MIDI track. One way to then get the audio of the different drum sounds onto different audio tracks, is to split the MIDI recording you made into 6 MIDI tracks. One track with the bassdrum notes, one with the snare notes, etc. If you then play back these tracks one by one, (each time muting the other 5) you can record the audio for each drum sound seperately, track by track.The MIDI channel that you can set for each drum sound can (only) be used to control sound parameters. You could use this to your advantage, because you can control level, pan, in fact all sound parameters of each drum sound.

I guess it comes down to new features/omissions that users want/don't want. @Atarikid you CAN eq per channel & although it lacks 6 outputs that shouldn't discourage you from soloing (or split panning) some channels to get individual sounds to your DAW/sampler, etc. Also if you route the midi to say Logic Pro, it's possible to record a pad performance as midi then separate the notes onto individual midi tracks.  That being said I wish there was feature on the ND3 that would allow a user to switch between 1/4"" trig inputs and individual audio outputs.

MIDI in and out to your 3P, it is important to have both connected,-I've read on several forums that some USB-MIDI interfaces are fine with regular MIDI data (I mean notes, pitch bend, etc), but struggle with sysex data such as an update, if you have another interface at hand, or can borrow one (preferably another model, brand).. perhaps try that one too..Hope this helps,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=75094&sid=ec0e1bafa5386a4e1d17e223eff13850#p75094

I still haven't found a way to send Bank changes though. ND 2 doesn't respond to Ableton's way of sending Bank changes. Only being able to send Program changes and no Bank changes isn't very useful for a live performance. Same problem using Modstep on an iPad. There is no way to send cc for MSB and LSB in Ableton nor in Modstep. It seems that those software are preconfigured to send MSB first then LSB (which is the normal order that most synths and drum machines use) when Nord Drum 2 has an inversed order for bank change as mentioned in the manual (LSB first then LSB).,https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=84321&sid=ec0e1bafa5386a4e1d17e223eff13850#p84321

These pedals are not compatible with the Nord Drum models as you may already know, in the sense that the open/closed position will not have any effect on the sound.It would require some complex MIDI trickery to let the position of a foot pedal determine the note length parameters on the Nord Drum, not impossible but not really practical. So, I think if you want open/close sound and feel, find yourself a second hand drum brain and hihat pedal, use that unit generate the sound. Exactly as you suggested. Check the specifications if the drum unit reacts to half open positions of the pedal, if you want a more natural response. Perhaps someone else here can give you better suggestions what to look for..There are two options on the Nord drum itself that might help you to get a hihat like sound:Using 2 pads: create one pad with the sound of a closed hihat, and one pad with a sound of an open hihat. Then define a mute group so that these 2 pads exclude each other, after you’ve hit the pad with the open hihat sound, you can stop the sound by hitting the other pad.Using 1 pad: create a sound where the length of the hihat sound is dynamically controlled, so that if you hit it harder it will sound longer. I found this working quite ok, and got used to the playing style quickly..Good luck!Cheers,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=94097&sid=ec0e1bafa5386a4e1d17e223eff13850#p94097

I'm thrilled as I expected to be and thought this may be the right time to ask around whether anyone else using the Nord Beat 2 app have the same experiences as I do. In a nutshell: the bpm values set in the app, in reality,  are prone to shift up a little, by a few decimals. In a little more detail:  when, say, the tempo is set to 126, the app actually sends 126.1 or 126.2.. some bpms, like the good old 120 seem to be intact and remain 120 at the end, but usually there's this little, but annoying difference.  I tested this with and without a MIDI interface (i.e.:when  Nord Beat sends clock directly to other apps like SamplR or Loopy AND when Nord Beat sends clock via the iConnectMIDI interface to the Nord Drum) and the results are always the same. So it is not the interface causing the shift, the bug, if this is a bug at all, comes from Nord Beat. I'd like to have a steady bpm all around so that I can play my other gear in sync with the Nord Drum, SamplR, etc. Shall I forget the app and get a hardware sequencer? If so, I thought maybe the Arturia Beatstep would come handy. If you have experience / info on this bpm-shift issue and/or the Nord Drum-Beatstep integration, please share.  Thanks a million!Cheers, Gabor",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=59922&sid=ec0e1bafa5386a4e1d17e223eff13850#p59922

When the Loopy app is the clock source the Midibro measures a slightly lower bpm than expected. When I connect my ERM Midiclock+ device to the Midibro, it also reads some slightly lower bpm. When I connect the Midiclock+ to the Loopy app, all bpm values are exactly as expected.[btw.: The bpm measurement of the Midibro shows some fluctuations, regardless of the clock source. This either means that all the sources, including the 'rock solid' Midiclock+ have some MIDI clock jitter. And/or the Midibro's internal reference clock isn't 100% stable. When I connect the Midiclock+ to the Loopy app, the reading is very stable, the app clearly does some smooth and slow averaging as it is also slow to adapt to abrupt intentional large changes in tempo..]Funny stuff, ... but to come back to your question..I think, in general, that two (even seemingly identical) devices will not run exactly at the same tempo, even when both are set on exactly the same tempo. Therefore I think it is a good idea to use one MIDI clock source for all your apps/devices, sync everything to that one clock source. As long as everything is in sync with each other, and there isn't too much fluctuation from the clock source, all should be fine. And then it doesn't really matter what the exact bpm value is, or reads, right? The different bpm readings in the 2 synced apps, I think, doesn't mean that they are actually running on different tempos, or do you hear them drifting apart?Cheers,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=59937&sid=ec0e1bafa5386a4e1d17e223eff13850#p59937

Indeed,  tempo fluctuation is kinda rooted in the nature of MIDI and ""rock solid clock"" may be just a myth after all. I guess I can live with this or find a workaround and use a single device as the master clock. I'm not sure though if I can get it work it right as, like I said in my first post, my synths tend to translate the incoming clock data as per their own protocol and this results in behaviours not really fitting the song structures I'm working on. The Mopho x4 is a good example; it reads external MIDI all right but it also becomes a total slave and its sequencer plays only when the Nord Beat is running. Plus it translates the notes on the drum channels into voices so it plays notes, too.  So far I've been unable to get rid of this issue, maybe it's not even possible, can't tell right now. Muting the drum channels when they're not needed in the composition may be a solution, but a very awkward one. I could sync the whole lot to my DAW (Reason 8.3...guess I gotta love Swedish stuff...I also have a Teenage Engineering OP-1... and I drive a Saab) but don't want to take my notebook and audio interface to gigs ...(.. reading back all this raises the possibility of me having far too many problems...) I'd prefer to do this in a more straightforward manner without complex syncing-routes. The iPad is such a sleek and versatile tool/instrument, I use it exclusively to play backing tracks if that is the case, play SamplR and Loopy live, synced to another app...possibly Nord Beat. SamplR, for instance, does exactly what I need: reads the external tempo but has its own transport controls alive, no forced start/stop. And to answer your ultimate question, yes, the tiny tempo drifts are enough to move the track out of sync over time,usually in the matter of a mniute or two; Nord Beat runs at bpm 126 (let's stick to the example) which in SamplR becomes 126.1, then at some point I start the Mopho's sequencer set to bpm 126 dead on beat and pretty soon I notice that it's running a tad behind the Nord Drum. Retriggering the sequence of course helps, temporarily. Anyway, I guess I'll have to accept that this is all down to MIDI and gotta live with it. Will and can.I emailed Nord Beat's developer, Kymatica earlier today, asking Jonathan to consider rolling out an update which should offer bpm decimals - with that the actual tempo could be tricked into whole numbers. We'll see what he's got to say.Thanks again, talk to you guys later.Cheers, Gabor",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=59942&sid=ec0e1bafa5386a4e1d17e223eff13850#p59942

If I understand correctly, in your example the Mopho is not synced thru MIDI but set on 126 bpm? I think you only need to get the above problem with the Mopho sorted, then you can use the NB app as main clock source for the apps, and the Mopho as well. In the physical MIDI world perhaps it will require a MIDI splitter or so, or maybe your Mopho also has a MIDI thru..

Hitting stop then play doesn't seem to affect the tempo value. And of course, the A1 is receiving midi (A1's red midi light flashing/note sequence plays, etc.) so if I adjust NB tempo the A1 responds accordingly.I should clarify that this happens with/without using a Y cable. The Y cable is only to send a separate signal to both A1 and ND2.Come to think of it the ND2 doesn't care what the tempo is, just if there's a program change.The only tempo that's important to ND2 is for repeat(s) which is stored in programs or adjusted manually. Hmmm, maybe that's why the master clock doesn't send continuous, exact values (like 126.1, ""E.cl"") but that's just guessing on my part. :geek:I haven't tried running E.cl sync from any other iPad app besides NB, I'll try with Cubasis.Cheers,Nate",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=60115&sid=ec0e1bafa5386a4e1d17e223eff13850#p60115

Good point of Happy to first check what the TR8 is actually sending, with a MIDI monitor application like MIDI-OX, you can check what notes are sent if you can’t set them yourself & it’s not in the manual what the notes are. When you know the note numbers and MIDI channel, check the following on your 3P:1) If your TR8 is sending notes on MIDI channel 16, use the same MIDI channel on your 3P as general MIDI channel, you want to see this on the 3P: [GL.16],  - (this is what it looks like on the Nord Drum2 display, should be similar on 3P).2) I think you don’t need the individual MIDI channels, so it’s better to switch them off. For each of the 6 channels you should see see: [Ch.OF] on the display. If you do want to use the individual MIDI channels, make sure not to use MIDI channel 16 for any of the individual channels. Otherwise multiple drum sounds will be triggered at the same time when the TR8 is sending just one note.3) As Happy says, for each of the 6 channels check the MIDI notes in the MIDI settings, and match them with the notes the TR8 is sending.Cheers,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=91557&sid=ec0e1bafa5386a4e1d17e223eff13850#p91557

Now every time I need to up/download load a bank I need to unplug the other MIDI interface.This is the nightmare of the proprietary program dump protocol path Nord has chosen for their products instead of just using plain Sysex by a MIDI utilities..Sooner or later it breaks under changing hardware or software/OS and will never be fixed. but MIDIOX has the same problem. Only ""MIDITools"" and the Chrome MIDI API work correctly with multiple identical interfaces.Thank you Nord, excellent strategy, service and job done.Also note that two MIDISPORT MIDI interfaces on Windows 10 won't work with the MAUDIO provided drviers on their wesbite, only the Microsoft drivers work correctly (so uninstall any M-Audio drivers). with the MAUDIO drivers only one interface is detected by MIDI Win32 API. Once Microsoft drops the Win32 MIDI API  for the UWP API (that may happen in the next years), All old Nord software (any many other applications) will become disfunctional.

Not sure what is going on there, I doubt if it’s a bug in the Nord software per se. As you say, MIDI-OX also has a problem with that configuration.-I don’t think there will ever be a new firmware version released for the ND2. So if you have a working interface, now is the time to update your ND2 to the latest, if you hadn’t already. With updates, Nord thus far has published installer software that is compatible with operating systems of that moment.-The lack of proper drivers will make a MIDI interface dysfunctional, and although unfortunate, I bet that if that happens, there will be other USB-MIDI interfaces that will work properly on Win 10, or whatever Win version there is at that time.Cheers,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=91346&sid=ec0e1bafa5386a4e1d17e223eff13850#p91346

Perhaps different methods are used to recognize connected interfaces (?)

Anyway, I guess in theory it should be possible to let the Drum 2 Manager work with your setup, not sure if Clavia will update the software for this. Although less ideal, there is a work around. Even without the Manager you can still transfer programs to and from the ND2 with SysEx dumps.

The 3P only sends from the general MIDI channel.

Of course, many sound editing options as described on website.However, can't seem to find metronome available, nor the possibilty to have different output signals as per main output or headphones, so as to be able to listen to the click.Can't seem to find neither how to loop sounds other than setting a long sustained delay, is that correct?

Looping would have to be set via MIDI-PC, is that right?Other thing I can't seem to find is the triggering sounds through pad/channels; i.e. I would like to trigger a rain sound with a pad impulse... Don't have an external memory slot, so again, via MIDI-PC, right?I added an attachment for what I understand should be the connections requested for a proper usage.

However, the way it responds to your playing is surprisingly realistic, dynamics control not only the sound level, but also the sound itself.-It doesn't have a metronome on board, nor a sequencer, it's not a drum computer.-Delay is not infinite, to make loops you'll need an external sequencer, like a hardware sequencer, app or software-it doesn't have a separate output for each channel, it only has Left and Right outputs & you can pan each of the 6 sounds.-the sound on main and  phones outputs is the same, you indeed need a mixer to add a metronome to your monitor mix-If you want to use the 3p to trigger a sample like a recording of rain shower, you can, but you'll need a sampler, either hardware or software, the 3p can't play back samples itself.

I plan on purchasing ND2 sometime in the future, just not a priority since I got Octatrack. SPDSX and DTXM12 handle my need for velocity sensitive use of custom samples.After using iPad, iPhone, and my laptop for firing off samples from my ND1 initially, I've made the investment of the SPDSX, the DTXM12 and realized that for me, although it takes more initial setup to get the samples into these machines, I enjoy the stability, the immediacy, and the simplicity of one device... the computing devices require a midi interface and an audio interface, not to mention bringing a computer to the gig.I actually still use the iPad with the DTX and the Camera Connection Kit, since it works as a midi interface and makes building kits much quicker with the M12 app.To summarize, Apps will work: plan on budgeting for an audio / midi interface in addition as it will make things much easier.Again, I like the DTXM12 here because you can get MIDI into a computer with a USB cable or an iPad with a USB cable and the CCK.Its really going to depend on what you need it to do...DO you need velocity responsiveness from your sampler? How often are you trying to change samples, or build kits? If its just one shots, don't discount things like Roland SP404, Korg ES-1 or Kaoss pad... there are a bunch of devices that will fire off any sample you input from a pad impulse via MIDI, and some of them will  add more dimension to your rig.. Kaoss pad effects are super cool with synths, SP404 would let you record dog farts ( as an example ) and play em back... OP-1 would give you a 4-track, keys, and a sequencer.It's a brave new world out here.Ed",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=90659&sid=ec0e1bafa5386a4e1d17e223eff13850#p90659

If you think of playing the nord through an amp, your signal chain looks like this:Nord Drum -> cable -> Amp ( if you use headphones only, then Nord -> Headphones )adding the looper is like this:Nord Drum -> cable -> Looper -> cable -> amp ( if you use headphones only, Nord -> cable -> Looper -> headphones )So you need the looper and one more cable( if you use an amp).If you want to loop with your iPad and 3p I'd recommend the following:1) AudioBus 2 or 3 or whatever the latest is.WHY? Audio bus lets you turn off the 100hz High Pass Filter on the iPad input so all of the rich low frequencies come through into the Looper App.2) Loopy HDWHY? super easy looper. touch the circle to begin recording, tap it again to stop recording and play back what you just recorded, touch a different circle to make a new loop that plays along with the first. It also has a metronome and supports audio interfaces with multiple outputs.3) an audio interface that has 1/4"" input, 1/4"" output, and a headphone output.WHY? Headphone output so you can hear the click without it going to the main output, 1/4"" input ( guitar cable ) because your Nord has one, and 1/4"" output because most amplifiers and studio gear is ready for thatDoes this all make sense to you?All of us were new to this stuff at one point, so ask questions. AFAIK there is no drum multipad with an inbuilt looper.  Also the 3p isn't missing any features..

The schematics are nowhere to be found, so luckily I was able to borrow a second, mostly working, unit so I could probe around with an oscilloscope and learn how the working one worked and pinpoint where the broken one wasn't.The other unit was a later revision, and interestingly Clavia had changed the power supply connector from a standard 3.5 mm connector to a telephone type RJ-11 6/4 connector. Inside the changes are minimal, but I noted that in Michael's unit the markings on most of the chips had been unhelpfully scraped off by the manufacturer, but I suppose they realized that that didn't accomplish that much, so on the second unit they were all intact, which made it easier to figure out what was going on.I don't know if the fault on Michael's unit is typical, anyhow, an output on a 4069UB hex inverter had ceased to function as an output (it behaved as though it wasn't connected to anything on the chip at all). Either it was due to old age (not unheard of with this generation of CMOS chips), or something in this region in the circuit taxes that chip too hard causing premature failure - this part of the chip is used as a voltage controlled oscillator for the sample clock, which is not really the intended use for a digital chip, although it is common practice.An interesting note I made is that contrary to most 8-bit drum machines of the period (such as the Sequential DrumTraks or the Oberheim DMX and DX) which use µ-law compressed audio which compresses 12 bits of audio data into 8 bits for storage in an 8 bit EPROM chip, the DPP-1 uses an 8-bit linear digital-to-analog converter and hence the samples are stored as 8 bit linear data.The actual cartridge simply contains a single 32 kbyte EPROM chip, and the two switches on the front of the machine select one of four regions in the chip, in effect working as a sound selector. It would not be hard to program your own sounds if you have an EPROM programmer, but unfortunately it looks like there's not enough space for an IC socket inside the cartridge so it would not be as straightforward as removing the chip, programming it in an EPROM programmer, and replacing it.Anyway, I suspect a lot of the charm of a machine of this vintage comes from the original sounds. And I think the 8-bit microcomputer (the ABC80) used to create them is still on exhibit at the Clavia factory in Stockholm, together with the specially designed hardware for the sampling process.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=89781&sid=ec0e1bafa5386a4e1d17e223eff13850#p89781

Perhaps a delay (/'Echo)' might fool you. Anyway, it's always good to try several drum sounds, but I bet you already did.Perhaps you can feed whatever is sent to the ND2 to a MIDI monitor application such as MidiOx (PC) or MIDI Wrench on iPad, I'm sure there is one for Mac as well. Very handy tools to find out what is actually going on with MIDI.If you're playing your ND2 with the Nord pad, or other pads, and record MIDI on a computer or tablet, make sure to switch Local Off on your ND2 if you need monitoring from your DAW, or leave Local On, but switch off monitoring in your DAW.But perhaps I should first ask you what your setup is. What are the MIDI settings on your ND2?What software or app / hardware are you using to control the ND2?If you're on a computer or tablet, what MIDI interface are you using?Cheers,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=87751&sid=73aea294c6af689c714f70c8c2af0a6b#p87751

Piezo's can be used as contact mics, but if you mount a piezo to an acoustic drum, and connect it to the trigger input of the 3p, you won't be hearing the acoustic drum sound coming out of the 3p. The trigger input on the 3p 'listens' to the signal coming in, and once it is strong enough the 3p will produce a drum sound. And if you hit the drum harder, the 3p will produce a louder sound. To get an impression of the kind of sounds the 3p can make, check the demo's on the Nord website.MIDI is digital information, a way to let musical instruments and sequencers communicate with each other. There is no audio (digital nor analog) going thru MIDI cables. If you press a key on a keyboard, a message is sent from the MIDI output which tells which key is pressed, & how hard. If you have an ipad, you can use the Nord beat app to program drum patterns, create beats. Here also MIDI is used to trigger sounds in the Nord drum 3p.Hope this helps..Cheers,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=82140&sid=73aea294c6af689c714f70c8c2af0a6b#p82140

Use a short decay, experiment which type works best. When you have the main part of the sound right, try different types of click. If that all worked out ok, add a very short single delay perhaps, to add one virtual hand. Then copy the sound to a second channel, perhaps make the copy slightly different, to a second virtual finger snapping person.Not sure if it will work, if not, and real finger snapping isn't an option, perhaps try something completely different, be creative.Good luck!Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=81534&sid=73aea294c6af689c714f70c8c2af0a6b#p81534

I have a Strymon Dig double delay connected to the Nord Drum 2 and they seem to fancy one another. The DIG has a single input channel (and L + LR outs)  but with resetting a jumper inside the pedal it will accept stereo in. The Nord's own echo/delay is already a cool feature but as fas as I can tell, adding external delay to even the whole mix doesn't hurt a bit. With the hard panning suggestion things can only get better. I also tested my other delay box, an EHX Memory Man with Hazarai and like what I heard, though the MM is dirtier (at least to my ears and definitely in a good way!) and prone to overload incoming low frequencies into heavy clipping and distortion. It has a filter knob with  a wide frequency range so it is possible to tame the lows, though like that the output signal has far less 'oomph'. I will try the panning thingie with the Hazarai too, probably on snare, hat and some fx percussion channels and will leave the kick and the remaining channels dry. Then I'll give this a go on the Strymon Big Sky as well. Will record and post audioclips as I proceed.

OS updates seem to pose a challenge for some USB - MIDI interfaces, I think you are not the only one. But I hope they will keep the DIN MIDI ports in future models..I don't think the volume of the headphones output of the ND2 is too low perse. I think it very much depends on the headphones you're using. With my headphones (250 ohms, closed type), maximum volume will damage my ears. But others on this forum had a similar experience as you, discussed herehttp://www.norduserforum.com/nord-drum- ... 10393.html. I suspect the impedance of the ND2 headphones output is a tad higher than usual, so that you get a weaker output with low impedance (eg 30 or 40 ohms) headphones. Just a theory. Don't forget to check the channel level settings b.t.w. The ND3p has an improved headphones output level according to the website.With a low volume on your headphones you might tend to hit the pads harder to compensate.The acoustic noise of sticks and pads annoy me too, but are not unique to the Nord Pad. Especially if you want to record acoustic drums combined with electronic drums you should take care of mic positioning. Try to hit acoustic drums a bit harder, and play the pads more gently. Adjusting the response of the pads with the sensitivity settings might help here. Also check the channel level settings. Programming drum sounds that blend in with the acoustic noise from the pads also helps if there is a lot of the pad sounds bleeding into your drum mics.I also prefer one function per knob, but you'll get used to the ND2 quickly is my experience. This layout keeps the unit small. Perhaps an intermediate design would be nice, where you pick the main parameter with buttons, and tweak the parameters for each channel with 2 rows of 6 endless encoders..The MIDI options are equally complex as those of the Nord Stage I think. The difference perhaps is that the menu on the Stage is easier to understand, the bigger display on the Stage certainly helps. If you want to want to program beats with the app or a sequencer, simply ignore the individual MIDI channels, the default settings will do. If you want to control sound parameters with MIDI, use the individual MIDI channels. In combination with a keyboard the individual MIDI channels can be interesting too, you can play melodies with a single drum sound, but check the manual, or read some threads here to find out how that works..Cheers,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=81473&sid=73aea294c6af689c714f70c8c2af0a6b#p81473

I agree with you on all counts. It didn't occur me about playing drums like a pitched instrument on a midi channel. Have now recorded a bunch of new videos where I have a lot of fun playing with sticks, keyboard and hands.There is no doubt it sounds fabulous and quite unique.  My intended purpose though was to generate interesting drum sounds for my compositions.  And after the convenience of vst plugins I'm finding the ND to be a bit tedious  to use.  Gotta hook up 2 midi cables, 2 audio cables, wall wart, then playback/record one track for each drum channel, and be stuck with the result, without possibility to tweak the sounds after you've recorded the take.  Yeah, this is not the fault of Nord or their drum, it's just I've gotten spoiled with the easy plugin workflow.With this in mind I'm selling it on and looking for software alternatives.

Noise not a sample that gets played back the same way for each note. It behaves like real noise, random, so in the first and the last example I actually expect each note to be slightly different.In the middle two examples you didn't use noise or a noisy click. Perhaps the fact that the oscillators are not reset for each new note, plays a role here. With a sharp attack, the beginning of each note will sound slightly different. I don't know whether that explains the differences you can hear and see. Perhaps try even shorter notes at a high tempo, to see if the variation in sound is cyclic. Or try to see if very long notes also differ from each other, I mean after the attack, during the decay of the sound.Cheers,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=81227&sid=73aea294c6af689c714f70c8c2af0a6b#p81227

I'm happy to go a little more into what I'm working on, but it doesn't seem too necessary at this point. But essentially, I am looking to interface trigger pads via the ND2 (and also via a MIDI processor) to a sampler (Elektron Octatrack). I've been having issues getting these all to communicate - the technical problems have pretty much stopped the creativity at this point, so I'm determined to get things going again!In trying to figure out what was going on, I decided to use a midi monitoring device - just so I could clarify what was coming from the Nord and adjust accordingly. It was responding. One thing that was unexpected was that the note number was different from what I'd set in the MIDI sub-menu. So this could have been affecting the commands I'd been sending.The other thing it clarified was that the ND2 does send a 'NOTE OFF' message, which I wasn't sure about. However ... when I set the Global MIDI channel to OFF, the 'TRIG' button ceased to send any information whatsoever. The MIDI channels correspond with the INPUT channels on the Nord, for ease of use on my part (1-6). You can see the output of the monitoring in the attached image. I pressed the TRIG and changed the INPUT CHANNELs 1, 2 and 3. I then changed the Global channel to 2 and did the same. When I changed it to Global ... nothing. The 'Control Change' messages are from clicking the 'Channel Select' buttons.Is this a problem, or am I missing something here? The funny thing is, when I had managed to get things partially working, it ONLY seemed to work when the Global MIDI channel was ON! So it seems to be at the root of the problem in both instances.

Otherwise, I'd assumed, you could still send/receive information on the 6 MIDI channels separately. The manual states quite clearly that using both Global and Individual MIDI channels ""make it possible to record, and to play back the MIDI notes and parameter changes."" I guess it could be that the individual channels don't output MIDI information ... but that seems odd.So, I had thought that turning off the Global MIDI channel wasn't ""turning off"" MIDI, as you describe it. More like: I'm standing at the sink, and there are six separate faucets. I can turn each of them on or off independently. But then there's actually another one, the Global faucet. When I turn that one on, the output from the other six is re-routed and comes out of one of six miniature tubes in the global faucet so that when I now turn faucet '1', the equivalent pipe in the Global faucet will turn on or off.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=81246&sid=73aea294c6af689c714f70c8c2af0a6b#p81246

The old labels of the first version units were a bit confusing after the OS update, not a big deal, but I agree it was a bit inconvenient.I think most instruments I own get regular software updates. I even have two alternative (official) verions for a synth. And some unofficial versions for some other gear that add or change some functionality. I bet even a washing machine gets software updates nowadays.I think a digital instument is basically a box with some knobs, buttons, perhaps a screen, some in and outputs built around a dsp. The functionality mostly depends on how it is programmed, quite flexible.

These gate outputs give off a certain voltage as long as a note is played. This voltage can be used to trigger the envelope / increase amplification of a synth with a gate input. The ND doesn't have gate inputs, and the trigger inputs are -apparently- triggered twice by each note sent from the Beatstep pro drum gate outputs. Perhaps using the shortest note length (1/32th) at a high tempo might fool the inputs of the ND so that only one sound is triggered?I have to say that playing with cv and patch cables is a lot of fun, really hands on, to experiment and make 'wrong' connections and still end up with interesting results - sometimes, but not always. I also see why things like MIDI and virtual analog synths were invented. (Winter is coming so my oscillators will need some trimming)My question is, in case you would use the Beatstep pro to control 1 or 2 analog synths with the cv outputs, and control the ND via MIDI, will the -possibly- higher latency of MIDI really be noticable? Perhaps it is, just wondering... Or do you have another reason why you don't want to use MIDI?",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=62045&sid=73aea294c6af689c714f70c8c2af0a6b#p62045

In my opinion, gaining per-channel reverb while giving up stereo is a good deal.I use a TC Electronic Hall Of Fame Mini Reverb:http://www.tcelectronic.com/hall-of-fame-mini-reverb/And a Berhinger Micromix MX400:http://www.music-group.com/Categories/B ... 00/p/P0390Some things to do with the TC HOF:1) Download the TonePrint app from TC Electronic:http://www.tcelectronic.com/toneprint-editor/2) Connect the TC HOF to your computer by USB and run the TonePrint app.3) The app should recognize your HOF and give you an editor for all the parameters for the reverb, browse through all the ones they give you or make your own.4)Absolute must: set the ""Kill Dry"" setting to ""on"", this will make the signal completely wet (will explain later)optional) Set up the knob to increase ""dynamix"" and ""release time"" as the knob is turned up (you can turn off the effect entirely with the bypass switch)5) Make sure you press the ""Store To Pedal"" button on the editor before disconnecting the USB.Then on the Nord Drum 2:1) Plug output 1 on the Nord Drum 2 into input 1 on the Micromix2) Plug output 2 on the Nord Drum to into the input of the TC HOF Reverb3) Plug the output of the TC HOF Reverb into input 2 on the Micromix4) Plug the output of the Micromix to your amp/mixer/interface/etc5) Find a kit you like.6) Use the per-channel panning as a per-channel wet/dry knob. If you've set this up as I've described then panning of 20.0 will be completely dry and 0.20 will be completely wet. So instead of using the TC HOF's knob as our wet/dry, we're using each of the ND2's channel pan settings as our wet/dry. Get it?Really, I can't say enough about TC's TonePrint pedals. If you ever wanted a pedal to be configurable in detail like a synthesizer (or your Nord Drum 2), then you'll want one of these TonePrint pedals. I use a Hall of Fame Mini mainly because it was cheaper than the regular sized version. The main difference between the Mini and the full sized version is that the full sized has a bunch of standard presets built onto the thing. But what they both have in common is only ONE TonePrint slot. All I ever use is the TonePrint slot and I only need one knob for sensitivity and release time so the Mini version is just fine.Matt",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=71185&sid=8346388f84a39302c5c5f33e4877b343#p71185

You can indeed play with the wet/dry fx mix by the panning method suggested above. Panning every voice independtly, in the true sense of  panning would only be possible with six outputs and the six sounds recorded on six mono channels, panned later in the mix wherever you please. I have my ND2 set up very much like @rhombus describes his rig; channel R is the fx channel routed thru an analog filter/drone box, a Red Panda Particle delay/pitch shifter and a Strymon Dig stereo double delay (set to mono in) on a pair of channels panned hard L and R, while the Nord's channel L processes the dry signal on a single mono channel. I have some of my kits set with the kick hard panned to the dry channel and the other five voices panned to the fx route.  Would love to hack the ND2 somehow into a 6-output module by modding the trig ins but don't think that'd be very easy, if at all possible. It's a complex piece of gear and turning the trig ins into audio outs would definitely need a great deal hard-(re)wiring and PCB modding. And this maneuvre is just completely out of my league, nor I know of anyone who could handle it. Anyone has a nephew at Clavia's drum synth dept maybe?",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=71208&sid=8346388f84a39302c5c5f33e4877b343#p71208

I feel like giving up panning for reverb is worth it for the extra presence. Sometimes the ND2 can feel a bit thin in the mix compared to some of the other instruments I use.

The transfer always goes without any problems and the destination bank IS overwritten ... all with INIT sounds...i doubt that's how Boska's  custom work sounds like.I tried with different banks with the same result.

I bought the ND2 new last summer and for some reason I was convinced that it came with the latest OS. This explains why the Boska and Tilliander banks (you were right again, that one didn't load properly either..) couldn't be saved on the unit. I've just updated to OS3 and everything seems to work as before. This is true for being unable to send bank 1 to my Mac so if it's a bug it seems to persist, maybe one of the soundfiles is corrupted or something. I have but a few modified kits in P1 so I'll try to send the factory bank 1 to the ND and see if it changes anything for the better.Thanks again!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=70254&sid=8346388f84a39302c5c5f33e4877b343#p70254

Hopefully this will solve issues for those also getting one midi note etc. Essentially, it depends on the midi cables themselves. I have two sets - one is a very short but from a music store, the others very long and from ebay. Needless to say, the ebay ones are the issue. Now they look the same, they still send midi, but they fail to consistently receive midi from the ND2. I believe that is due to the pin configuration not being correct or they are not using a proper cable (bandwidth).So answer to any midi issues is to first ensure that your cables are reputable. If in doubt, try other cables. Crazy I know, but it will save you getting different interfaces etc. Its especially confusing as the cheap cables will still work, but just not all of the time (in my experience it was actually everything but ND2 software and midi slave mode).Hope that helps - I spent a couple months trying to sort this out, I know there are others in the same situation, this is what solved it for me.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=48445&sid=8346388f84a39302c5c5f33e4877b343#p48445

Unit works fine except MIDI control with Roland Octopad SPD-30 is dodgy.  The answer seems to be found earlier in this thread, but seems like it should be highlighted somewhere else in forum or on Web as a MIDI defect?MIDI clock info that comes in from another device during ND2 startup makes it deaf to all incoming MID messages?  So anytime I start up the ND2, it must be started up by itself before MIDI'ing up with another device?I tried a couple of iterations in my current setup.1. If you start the ND2 by itself before connecting via MID with another device, all is well.2. If you start ND2 when connected up to another device with MIDI, it ain't gonna work, not matter how many times you hit the Octopads!3. If you do #2, and turn off the Octopad and restart (with the MIDI cable still connected), it will still not work.  You can only get the ND2 to accept MIDI signals in this case by turning off Octopad, disconnecting the MIDI cable, and restarting/reconnecting.Apparently this has not been fixed since this thread was first posted, as I am using software version 3.0?  You would think this would be recognized as a significant software flaw by Nord, especially for studios/musicians who might have a lot of cables hooked up and don't want to routinely unhook cables before starting to get things to work properly?Thanks for any additional input or assistance on this.

First make sure the level of the trigger button is set at 20, try several sounds, a couple of programs. For this test avoid sounds where channel levels are set to lower levels, etc..The [trig/tap] button (when set at 20) triggers sounds at maximum velocity.

My headphones (BD 770), are 250 Ohms, yours might be louder in theory, they are 38 Ohms (I quickly googled your headphones, not sure though). So be careful!If you do get good levels using the trigger button, your problem is probably on the input side, too weak trigger signals, possibly wrong sensitivity / dynamic curve (!) / trig type settings. Some pads also have a little knob to adjust sensitivity, yours too? You say you get irratic/varying results from your mesh pads, try different cables..If you don't get decent levels with the triggering button, it's either the (headphones-) output, your headphones, or your ears (just kidding)...

141071,27,8346388f84a39302c5c5f33e4877b343,p50584,My Ableton setup for the Nord Drum 2,11106,rhombus,2014-12-18T09:41:23+00:00,False,,"So I've seen a few posts recently about getting the Nord Drum 2 working with a DAW. I've attached an Ableton Live Pack that I made. I made it with Live 9.1. I'm not sure what the backwards compatibility issues are so if you try it with a different version please reply on this thread and let us all know if it works okay.NOTE: This Ableton Live Pack will most likely NOT work out of the box. You'll need to do some reconfiguring. You will be expected to know how to hook your Nord Drum 2 up to your MIDI interface and how to configure Ableton Live's MIDI settings.Installation1) Download the ZIP file attached to this post and extract it to your local disk.2) Start Ableton Live.3) Double click on the ALP file or select ""Install Pack"" from the File menu in Ableton Live and find it on your disk.4) In each of the 7 MIDI tracks there are External Instruments, reconfigure each of these for your particular MIDI interface device and ports. I kept the MIDI channels standard so unless you changed them on your Nord Drum 2 there should be nothing to do here.5) Read the notes on the Drum Rack I created below, you may need to reconfigure the Drum Rack to match your Nord Drum 2's settings.6) Make some music.I'm going to explain a couple things just so you're aware of how it works and what the issues are.Here's what the session view looks like:I'll just go from left to right:NordDrum: This is just a grouping of all the tracksND-M-Global: MIDI track with my own Drum Rack made for the Nord Drum 2, sends to the global MIDI channel 10.ND-M-1: MIDI track that sends to Channel 1 on the Nord Drum 2 (MIDI channel 1)ND-M-2: MIDI track that sends to Channel 2 on the Nord Drum 2 (MIDI channel 2)ND-M-3: MIDI track that sends to Channel 3 on the Nord Drum 2 (MIDI channel 3)ND-M-4: MIDI track that sends to Channel 4 on the Nord Drum 2 (MIDI channel 4)ND-M-5: MIDI track that sends to Channel 5 on the Nord Drum 2 (MIDI channel 5)ND-M-6: MIDI track that sends to Channel 6 on the Nord Drum 2 (MIDI channel 6)ND-A: Audio track for receiving a stereo signal from the Nord Drum 2ND-A-Left: Audio track for receiving a mono signal from the left channel of the Nord Drum 2ND-A-Right: Audio track for receiving a mono signal from the right channel of the Nord Drum 2You can use as many or as few of these as you want, I went for the ""kitchen sink"" approach. For most purposes, only ND-M-Global and ND-A are required for sending MIDI to and recording from the Nord Drum 2.ND-M-1 through 6 are for sending MIDI note or CC data to individual channels on the Nord Drum 2. You can use this to play a channel melodically (though monophonic). You can also use it to change the sound over time using MIDI CC. Refer to the Nord Drum 2 manual to find the table of CC# to parameters, it's all in there.ND-A-Left and ND-A-Right are handy if you want to treat the outputs on the Nord Drum 2 as two mono outputs. That way you can have different effects chains for both. Then on the Nord Drum 2 you change the Pan setting on each Channel to be either 20.0 or 0.20. Don't think of this as ""stereo"", think of it as two mono outputs. You could for example make a nice bass sound on Channel 6, pan it to the right, pan the other Channels left, then in Ableton put a reverb or an amp or anything else on the right channel to give the bass sound some extra presence or to EQ it, whatever you want to do.Below is the Drum Rack I created:Have a look at the Chain list on the Drum Rack. I set the Play parameters for each drum in the rack to correspond to the MIDI notes I set up on the Nord Drum 2.NOTE: I changed the MIDI notes on my Nord Drum 2 to more closely align with the General MIDI spec for drum machines. If I remember correctly, the default setup for the Nord Drum 2 had the notes an octave higher.Here's what I set all the notes to on my Nord Drum 2 and in Ableton Live:1: 36/C12: 38/D13: 40/E14: 41/F15: 43/G16: 45/A1Please refer to your Nord Drum 2 manual on how to view and change which MIDI notes are assigned to which Channel.Hopefully this is useful to you all. LMK if you have any questions about this pack. However, if you're unfamiliar with Ableton Live I strongly suggest you read the User Manual or make use of the thousands of Ableton Live videos on YouTube to get yourself up to speed.Share and Enjoy.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=50584&sid=8346388f84a39302c5c5f33e4877b343#p50584

By default the trigger button is set to trigger at maximum velocity, make sure your DAW sends notes with velocity 127 if you want to match that.lamouette wrote:i put the global channel off, and only use individual channel 1-1 / 2-2 /3-3 / ....I set the pitch at 60, but i can only play one note, whatever which midi note i set up on the ND2. i have to change the pitch to modify the pitch note, which is quite strange, as no one preset sound like it should sound.....Did i miss something ? or did something wrong ?Hmmm.. Seems like you set it up correctly! It puzzles me why it doesn't work..Let's go through it step by step:-In ND2 MIDI settings switch the global channel off [GL.OF] as you did, just to keep things simple for now,-On channel 1 of the ND2 you select MIDI channel 1 [Ch.1],-For the sake of this test, maybe turn the others off, so for channels 2-6 of the ND2 : select [Ch.OF]-Create a sound on channel 1 with the Tone section alone (/mainly)-(Feel free to add noise, but this is just to keep things clear and simple - and the filter frequency of the noise section can't be controlled with MIDI notes anyway),-On the ND2, set Tone pitch at 60 (which ensures that when you send MIDI note 60 you'll hear 'central' C)..-Make sure your DAW track sends to MIDI channel 1 (only)-You should be able to play a melody now (it's monophonic, so you can't play chords)Apart from the very first OS version (0.92) where it wasn't implemented yet, this should work properly with OS2.x  and the latest OS3.00..Hope this helps..Cheers,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=66215&sid=8346388f84a39302c5c5f33e4877b343#p66215

In this mode, the pitches you'll hear are the same as with the trigger button. Use velocity 127 to match the level of the trigger button..In case you're using individual MIDI channels, you have to select the appropriate MIDI channel to address the correct channel of the ND2. Any MIDI note can be used. The pitch you'll hear in this mode, now depends on the MIDI note you send to the ND2, so you can even play melodies. If you send MIDI note 60 (!) you will get the same pitch as set with the Pitch parameter on the ND2 (= same as with the trigger button).Use velocity 127 to match the level of the trigger button..So..- If you only want to program beats; use the global MIDI channel + the MIDI notes set in the ND2- If you want to make melodies, control the pitch, or have control over parameters of individual channels; use the individual MIDI channels.. Use MIDI note 60 to get the same pitch as you get with the trigger buttonCheers,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=66226&sid=8346388f84a39302c5c5f33e4877b343#p66226

However,as soon as i pressed record in Cubase, things changed dramatically... Wheras before, each hit on the pad instantly triggered a sound from Punch, now (during recording) the same hit would sometimes trigger a sound, and sometimes it would not!I thought this was strange, but what was even weirder was that every single hit on the paddidactually record as MIDI data. The problem was, the exact same issues still occured when i played the recording back!!I have been racking my brains trying to figure out what the problem is here, but so far it has eluded me...I have my suspicions that the problem lies with Rob Papen's Punch somehow, as icanactually get the recorded MIDI data to play properly if i drag it onto a VST Intrument track that uses Groove Agent One, for example. Still, i really would like to be able to use Punch, as the sounds it offers are far superior to those in Groove Agent One.OK, so I hope that describes my issue well enough... any help or advise would be most welcome!Thanks in advance:)Patch",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=65535&sid=8346388f84a39302c5c5f33e4877b343#p65535

Set-up the midi channel to 10 and away you go. I can give more details if you like but normally the issues are on the sample module end as they are all different. I use this set-up on occasion when I have the need to play samples and it works great - you can use any sample source you like such as a laptop/DAW, mpc, drum modules etc. Keep in mind that the ND 2 is a synth so when in midi slave mode you can't have some pads allocated to the synth and the others to samples as the midi option is a global instead of per channel option.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=64040&sid=8346388f84a39302c5c5f33e4877b343#p64040

It can be controlled with the Nord Pad, drum pads/triggers, or through MIDI (eg a sequencer).If the Maschine can be used as a (standalone?)

The ND2 is a stellar sounding drum synth which requires external hardware to trigger its sounds. If you have an iPad and an iOS device-compatible hub like the i ConnectMIDI ( imo both are essential tools in the world of today's electronic music-making) you can get pretty far with crafting beats. There are a number of fantastic apps (ie Patterning, Nord Beat...) out there that can control the Nord Drum and the results are excellent.So the ND2 is not an ""all in one box"" type of instrument, but an awesome one at that.

Hopefully someone from NORD chimes in and supplies the complete information.Let me explain:The manual says that for FILT TYPE, possible values are LP12, LP24, BP6, BP12, HP12, HP24, and HPHC, and they can be controlled externally via CC15.But it does not say which value of CC15 corresponds to each possible value of filtertype. It would be helpful if Nord's people give us the values for these parameters.Same goes to other similar params, like ATKMODE and a few others. Personally, for me it is a must to be able to tweak the voices in the Drum2, so please, provide us with more info on the parameters.Also in some other params, the manual says for example that ""range is 0-50"". How would that translate when i program a CC, should i limit it to 0-50, or should I program 0-127 as normal?

In the noise envelope section there's Attack Mode which will allow you to choose between traditional AD, cyclic LFO's  or Clap mode.  There's 9 clap settings (or reverb phase lengths) that get combined after a sawtooth wave(s) (defined by attack/rate amount). The overall length of the clap sound can be adjusted with the noise decay. Additionally the noise decay can be dynamically controlled (with dec lo amount) although for a clap sound a single decay should do the trick.

Maybe the Nord software is buggy in some way, but it does  seem to work on some systems.I think it could be a specific combination of hardware, software & drivers, complex stuff to figure out what is going wrong.Some thoughts:As you say, sysex transfer is more sensitive for problems because of the larger amount of data/time. Although your setup works with other software sending sysex data, maybe Nord uses a slightly higher tranfer rate than your setup can handle. (there is no way to limit the rate is there?) (and: don't get me wrong, not saying you have a bad interface etc.!)And, Or, given the crashes, perhaps the ESI driver and the Nord software don't like each other much.

Although I'm not sure how quick the ND2 will respond if you change a lot of parameters to completely reprogram sounds 'at once'Alternatively you could store several variations of one program. then you'll simply have to send program changes. Might work better..So I think there are a couple of ways to achieve what you want, how well it will actually work in practice, to quickly do program changes between 2 beats, depends on how quick the ND2 responds, and the tempo of your track, not sure -anyone else?Cheers,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=57663&sid=8346388f84a39302c5c5f33e4877b343#p57663

The ND2 has 6 total channels. With the Nord Pad (uses ethernet cable) connected you can add a 7th(1/4"") trigger to Ch.1 on the ND2. It will double whatever sound is assigned to Ch. 1.2.) When Nord Beat is playing the ND2 you can ""jam"" along with pads however Nord Beat isn't capable of recording/overdubbing midi. Also, the 6 ND2 channels are monophonic so it's possible to cancel out some sounds if you're playing the pads on the same channel & at the same time as the Nord Beat.Have fun!!Nate",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=57175&sid=8346388f84a39302c5c5f33e4877b343#p57175

Indeed the ND2 is capable of sampling and its pretty straight forward. As long as you can connect it via midi to the sample source like a macbook, put it in midi local mode off which is shift+lower parameter+midi then scroll through to Lo.On and turn the knob to Lo.off.  At this stage you can now set the sample source to midi notes for each pad. Midi notes for the pads are by default C5, D5, E5, F5, G5, A5 and they correspond with the 1-6 default layout.I hope that is simple enough, I could prob explain easier but I just finished work.

Triggering from the ND2 sends a midi note so the type of sample (and its limitations) depend entirely on what your sample source is. For instance, in Ableton you can trigger drum samples via drum rack or configure it to trigger an entire song.The set-up you choose really depends on your needs but to trigger samples keep in mind the sample source is what is generating the sound not the ND2. So a usb-midi from ND2 into your macbook and then audio-out from the macbook would work - just make sure you buy a reputable midi-usb converter (cheap ones cause issues).I have used Ableton and FLstudio so far and both work great. If you want a detailed breakdown step by step Im happy to help, just need to know what your set-up is and software etc. (although I am only familiar with ableton and flstudio) Hope that helps - I recommend reading the manual time and time again, always finding new tricks in it",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=50443&sid=e827f73df54ad7251930638288e33fd1#p50443

It's acoustic, I have it under my keyboard and plugged into mic channel on a mixer.That would be great, - interested! so you are now using the audio from the piezo right? -just one remark on that: piezos require very high impedance inputs, (at least 1MOhms I read), otherwise they will sound thin, because impedance mismatch here causes high pass filtering,there are some very cool websites on how to build your own very high impedance piezo pre-amp for audio recordings - hiZ instrument inputs also work ok-ish - how does your bass drum sound thru the mic input?I think I just have to plug it into a Nord Drum 2 to make a foot/kick trigger.Yes, you can connect this piezo directly to your ND2, you'll just need to experiment with threshold and sensitivity settings to suppress spontaneous and double triggering etc. If you want more triggers and don't feel like soldering more piezos, Korg makes some piezo clips that might be fun with the ND2, they come with their 'cliphit' drum-blob - but are also sold separately - and are cheaper than the ddrum and roland drum triggersImho Nord should communicate more about compatible triggers.Here's what they mention on the website: ""The 6 generic inputs can be connected to almost anything you like, electronic drum pads, acoustic drum triggers, a contact microphone, the outputs of an old drum machine and much more. Setting the Input and Threshold is easy and we’ve added a selection of presets for popular pads and triggers.

So on your iPad, you can only receive notes coming from your Nord Drum2 when you hit the pads...In order to send notes to your ND2, e.g. playing with the Nord Beat app & have your ND2 produce sound, you'll need an interface that has a MIDI OUT port.The iRig MIDI 2 is a good option, -  you'll also need two regular MIDI cables, best to buy these at a proper music store (local or web)Alternatively, find yourself any simple but decent USB-MIDI interface that supports Core-MIDI, for example the E-MU Xmidi1x1 works well and isn't too expensive -In order to use such a USB-MIDI interface with your iPad, you'll also need the camera connection kit (30-pin-to-female-USB or Lightning-to-female-USB) -if you're tempted to look for cheaper USB-MIDI interfaces, check this thread to see which interfaces perhaps to avoid:http://www.norduserforum.com/nord-drum- ... 53-10.htmlCheers,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=52341&sid=e827f73df54ad7251930638288e33fd1#p52341

Like in your software, you'd then have to match the MIDI channel, the channel set with 'MIDI CH' on the ND should correspond with the channel the sequencer/controller sends on.To play the ND through MIDI, no SysEx is involved, just standard notes. A MIDI note is just some basic data; which note (Note number 60 ='central' C etc) how hard it is played. In software, or hardware sequencers you can program or record these notes in time, and they are outputted again whenever you want to and press play...Each of the 4 channels (sounds) of the ND only 'listens' to 1 MIDI note number, these are set per channel in the MIDI NOTE menu of your ND. By default these are set as 60, 62, 64, 65 (correponding to 'central' C, D, E, F). In your sequencer, program your drum pattern, or song, using these 4 notes only..I hope that answered your questions...Cheers,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=50755&sid=e827f73df54ad7251930638288e33fd1#p50755

However, though synthetic, the sounds can have a nice 'organic' touch to them, and the sound responds very dynamically, lifelike to your playing -It's also good at mimicking tuned percussion - and it can mimic acoustic drum soundsto some degree, but perhaps not as realistic as some sample based drum modules do...Playing & Expression:If you want to play like you do on a drum kit, you'll need pads, or triggers, the ND2 is compatible with all big brand pads, but in contrast to some of the big brand drum modules the ND2 will only register striking force (velocity). It is not compatible with dedicated hi-hat triggers, will only use one zone of 'multi-zone' pads, and will not register striking position on the head like with the Roland 'supernatural' V-Drums. - However I have to say that the ND2 does a lot with just striking force alone, as said the sounds respond very dynamically to your playing, a lot of sound parameters depend on velocity - in that way you can even mimic hi-hat open & close playing a bit -  for example -Size of your kit:With the ND2 you can build kits of 6 sounds, as it has 6 channels: e.g. bass drum + snare + hi-hat + 3 toms,  (- or 2 toms and a ride... ) (or a set of wind gusts and sea noises)Taken together,  it's great for making beats, it is truly an excellent addition to an acoustic drum kit, but whether it can replace one.. is up to you!Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=49486&sid=e827f73df54ad7251930638288e33fd1#p49486

You will notice that program sharing pages exist here for samples and Stages, but not Electros.  This is not to discriminate against Electro owners -- it is simply the case that historically there has been no interest in trying to share Electro programs, Electro programs being rather simple affairs.  Recently someone came along motivated to try to set up an Electro program library and after much back and forth commenting from many members it eventually came to this (condensed version): at the present time there does not seem to be sufficient interest in creating a whole new library for Electro programs, so attaching them to threads will be the way to go for now.  The issue can be revisited if/when the trafficking of these things begins to show more volume.It would seem likely that the same will be the case for the ND2.  There seems to be little need for a seperate library at the present time, but this may change over time.  With so many banks already available from Nord, perhaps many users are using existing sounds.  Also perhaps the ones who are taking the time/trouble to do much custom programming are feeling protective of their work and not up for sharing.Bless,Pablo",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=48013&sid=e827f73df54ad7251930638288e33fd1#p48013

It's also very obvious with some of the other waveforms that have more high frequency content.Hopefully Nord will address this in an update.

My patch is a sine wave (A1), with no punch, pitch set to 44, and bend set to 20 with a bend time of 0. Decay is 11E.I remember my Yamaha RY30 used to vary in a similar manner when I used the bend envelopes, and those were samples starting from zero phase each time.

How can we get Clavia's attention to ask about this and possibly get them to address it?(Side note: I think when hits overlap due to long decay settings, the wave does not reset, in order to avoid the clicks that would result from jumping from the current position back to zero. At least this is what it looked like when I recorded some patterns with longer decays, and this is how I used to deal with this problem in Reaktor as well.

According to the manual the Nord Modular has a control rate of 24khz, so I doubt bandwidth is the culprit.I've seen rumors that the Drum engine is built from the G2, does anyone have one they could try to replicate a simple patch on and see if they have similar problems?",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=47969&sid=e827f73df54ad7251930638288e33fd1#p47969

With versions older than 2.x you can only set the global MIDI channel, and you won't see 'GL' in your display.On second thought, I doubt whether your problem is caused by wrong MIDI settings. Selecting the same channel (or note-) number for all individual channels will result in this: you will hear all 6 drum sounds at once* when you hit one pad (in pad mode of the app), and because each channel of the ND2 is monophonic, hitting more than 1 pad at once gives you the same as hitting one.*You didn't mention this, so I presume your problem is different.Because you mentioned your computer doesn't recognise the ND2 with the update software, I started thinking perhaps there is something wrong with your MIDI interface..

That is; with the pad connected to your ND2 it can only trigger one sound (channel), and hitting the rim won't make any difference.  EDIT: .. but you're using a Y cable to trigger 2 channels depending whether you hit head or rim.. (sorry, at first I thought this wasn't possible)A rim shot is normally played by hitting rim and head at the same time, if you also want to do that with your setup, you probably only want to program the loud overtones on the second channel. The difficult part will be the relation between how hard you hit the rim and head triggers and how exactly you program the 2 sounds dynamically, so that the whole will behave/sound as one instrument. Perhaps you also need to apply different trigger settings for rim and head. That would be cool, but no idea if it's do-able. You can also decide to only play either head or rim, which makes things easier in some aspects..Then for the rim-shot sound, start with your original snaredrum sound, and:- increase (Dyn) Timbre settings, and Timbre Decay until it starts to ring even more, but avoid a too complex sound,- or perhaps raise the pitch to a frequency of one of the overtones of your original snaredrum sound- perhaps boost it with a bit with EQ- perhaps decrease the level of the other channels because the rim-shot usually really stands out from the rest ...it will take some experimenting I guess, hope it will work!Cheers,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=46221&sid=e827f73df54ad7251930638288e33fd1#p46221

(CC7, e.g. val.127) and note-off messages turn Level back to min. (CC7, val.0) - In any case, for each Channel of the ND2 I used 2 instances of this plugin, and I had to set up 3 tracks in Cubase to get it all working* (see screenshot), so I had 18+1=19 tracks in total! Of course, a MIDI recording only has to be placed on track 1 (the one with the midiPolyphony plugin), the rest of the tracks only serve to route and modify the MIDI messages before they go to the ND2..- I got best results controlling Decay time of the Tone section (CC50), I didn't test it with Noise Decay time (CC21) but should work the same- it would make more sense controlling channel Level (CC7) because then you control the whole sound (including Noise) at once.. but this method rendered some minute audio clicking as I expected .. (OS v2.x)Conclusion: it can be done but it requires some software, any VST host will be able to do it as described as aboveI bet Ableton is much better suited for these type of tricks than Cubase is - but it works, that counts- any other ideas/improvements are welcome!Have fun experimenting & playing!Cheers,Albert*In Cubase third party MIDI plugins cannot be inserted like you would plugins on audio tracks, you have to use an instrument track, more on that here:http://www.kvraudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=299489",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=45072&sid=64a6ca7f541190fbf6e7f70b12f57f5f#p45072

The ND2's available midi routing schemes are very flexible and provide radically different ways to play the instrument.  Basically, these are:1) feed the unit note data addressing all six available voices on a single midi channel, with each voice assigned to a single note on that channel, or2) assign each of the six available voices to a different midi channel.Using method 2 provides the possibility to play each of the six voices chromatically (to the extent that they may be tuned to a pitch).  One thing to watch out for when using this mode, is to ensure that the Global Midi Channel is set to something different from the six voice channels.  Similarly, when using mode 1 above you'll want to ensure that none of the individual voice channels are set to the Global Midi Channel.  Keeping these settings separate will keep your midi situation simpler and give you reliably consistent performance.Bless,Pablo",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=44994&sid=64a6ca7f541190fbf6e7f70b12f57f5f#p44994

For example: a kick drum on ch.1, a snare on ch.2, hi-hat on ch.3, etc etc..If you'd connect your Stage2 with the Nord Drum2 using a MIDI cable, and set the Stage to transmit on MIDI channel 10, you'd be able to play the kick drum sound on the Nord Drum 2 by playing a C3 on your Stage, the snare with D3, the hi-hat with E3, etc. (the corresponding notes can be set in a menu, mentioned here are the ones set by factory) And the louder you play the louder the sound will be, or actually the ND2 can do a lot more with velocity levels than just that..In a sequencer you can record (or draw) these notes to create a drum pattern. When you hit play in your software they are sent to the Nord Drum2, voila..but there is more..You can change all parameters of the drum sounds thru MIDI, even of one individual drum sound if you like! To do the latter, you can couple individual MIDI channels to the individual channels (sounds) of the Nord Drum2..

With the DD-12 and GM drum sets you can use almost any note of a piano keyboard to play a whole range of sounds.. With the DD-12 you can make use of all 75 sampled internal drum sounds at the same time through MIDI, each sound is assigned to a unique MIDI note. With the ND2 you can only use the 6 sounds of one drum set (program) at the time. It can store up to 400 programs which you can fully program at will, but you can only use 1 set of 6 sounds at the time... The good thing is that you have full control over the synthesis of each sound, almost endless possibilities; from (sort-of) acoustic drum sounds, to old-school drum machine sounds, or very weird and surreal noises, you'd no longer be stuck with a fixed set of 75 samples...John wrote:I presume the Nord will download the recording so I can then play it live.> In contrast to the DD-12, the ND2 doesn't have, and cannot store any kind of recordings, sequences, or songs on-board. You'd have to bring a laptop or iPad along if you'd want to play pre-programmed sequences/songs on stage - alternatively you could connect some drum pads to it, and play some rhythms yourself live...Cheers,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=43619&sid=64a6ca7f541190fbf6e7f70b12f57f5f#p43619

The good thing with step sequencers though is that you can get perfectly quantized loops, while with an audio delay things can get a bit messy..You could also look for a looping/delay FX processor, some reverb units also have a delay built in (+a bit of reverb can be quite nice too!) Personally, I find a real audio delay more intuitive than the built-in MIDI-like-repeat. The drawback of using an effects processor is that the same effect is applied on everything, while on the ND2 you can set delay per channel.

I do think that the ND2 is a step closer to being an instrument (or drumkit if you like) in it's own right.You suggest adding hi-hat trigger compatibility, - or one could also think of:- multi-zone/position sensing (think of Mandala or Roland)- choke (mute with your hands)- well, just look at what some e-drum brands have made, esp. look at the features of the 'supernatural' series by RolandSonically I guess future Nord Drums will not make an attempt to mimic acoustic drumsets, but I agree incorporation of some of the above sensing techniques /pad types might make them even more expressive than current, we'll have to wait and see.Cheers,Albertbtw check the vic virth site 'A History of the Drumset':double drumming.jpg (1 MiB) Viewed 3163 times",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=42355&sid=64a6ca7f541190fbf6e7f70b12f57f5f#p42355

For example the DYN elements all say that you can set a second parameter (if you keep turning the knob to the right) that will be used when you strike the pad harder. However you access the second parameter like you do with all second parameters using the ""lower parameter button"", and the result is theopposite, the second value is used when you strike lightly and the first parameter is used when you strike harder.The unit outputs midi note data when you use the pads, which is great if you want to blend the sounds with samples.  However there is no Midi Through function, so if you use an Octapad to trigger the unit, the midi notes do not pass through and you can't blend the sounds with samples.My wishlist item is simple and probably easy to implement  - have a system parameter for Midi Through!Currently there is a Local on/off parameter that works as expected muting the inputs of the triggers when OFF.  However if you are using an octapad or other midi input, this is not enough - as that midi is never sent to the output to be recorded.  So you have to have the octapad go to the computer and that signal back out to the unit.  It's workable, but a midi through on/off would make the unit a little more flexible.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=36375&sid=64a6ca7f541190fbf6e7f70b12f57f5f#p36375

Also, with ND2 you get a filter sweep when you engage filter dynamics, the filter then becomes dependent of both decay time, and striking force at the same time, with ND1 you can set sweep time independently of decay time..plus, with ND1 you can also increase the decay time of the Click, so that the click becomes more part of the overall sound, extra layer, with ND2 the clicks are all very short, can't set decayI know it sounds a bit strange given all new noise features but perhaps adding a noise waveform to the Tone section could help making some nice noise sounds, -by layering- like gunshot type of sounds etc I used to do with ND1..Cheers,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=36405&sid=64a6ca7f541190fbf6e7f70b12f57f5f#p36405

In one of the tube vids the fantastic guy from Nord is demonstrating an 808 based kit and when he triggers the open hat, it rings at a different pitch after the initial hit, almost like a multilayered sample that has a slowere attack on the tail.Whatever the hell it is, I'll be battering it!Without sounding like a madman, the ND2 could be all the synth I need, I found myself using midi to trigger all four channels bit with delays between the triggers to get more mileage out of the engine, just sample the results and carry on. With the FM due and the resonance biz there should be fun for many years to come.I also noticed a lot more G2 type sounds from the ND2, especially the noise end.Can't wait anyway...",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=31918&sid=57c32e33c0e7de016562cfb26ad7cb08#p31918

However, I think I prefer either acoustic (bass)drum, or pure synthetic sound, so I'm not using triggers nowBrains/sound units (other than ND): none, perhaps in future my SPD-S / MPC samplers with my own samplesI think I'm one of the few who prefers rubber pads, I find both rubber and mesh play 'unnatural', rubber are much cheaper. OK, the Roland 'supernatural' units with position sensing etc., give a very natural response, but ND isn't a TD30. Perhaps a downside of combining acoustic drums with (rubber) pads is the acoustic noise the pads make when you hit them. I find all types of pads noisy in one way or the other. In ambient 'live' band recordings I don't hear my pads, I wonder what overhead mics will pick up. Perhaps I'll have to do some clever mic positioning.. For the time being I'll stick with my synthetic rubber pads to make purely synthetic sounds, combined with 100% acoustic drumsAmplification:At home I'm fine with studio monitors, headphones, but in rehearsal studio I use whatever vocal amp/pa is there, which doesn't always sound ok. The next step for me is to invest in some proper amplification. I bet we could start a whole new thread about amplification, well there is a sub-forum here; 'accessories and amplification' I will check that..One thing I found out is that because I combine acoustic and electronic sounds, the speakers should be positioned near the kit, it feels totally weird when half of the drum sounds are coming from the other end of the room..So that is my 'live' setup covered I think, so what's yours?Cheers,Albert",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=34382&sid=57c32e33c0e7de016562cfb26ad7cb08#p34382

I have that USB to Lightning convertor and it seems well made (especially for the price): at least is uses real rubber in the strain relief (I have cheapo Chinese cables where the 'strain relief' is just a bit of hard plastic).

I didn't understand why at first, but I think it is thanks to the fact they used a stereo socket:I think by pulling it back, the tip of the jack becomes connected with both tip and ring of the socket, while the ring of the jack is also (still) in contact with with the ring of the socket.In other words: the signal from the ND becomes connected with both left and right of your headphones.So, now your cable:  mono jack (that will go into the ND) to a female stereo jack (to plug your headphones in)I think you should indeed connect the tip of a mono jack - with both the tip + ring of a stereo female jack (see picture below, basically the same as your drawing..),(= shorting tip and ring of the female jack)  -You say the result is signal only on one side, - are you sure you didn't connect the tip (or sleeve) of the jack with both ring and sleeve of the female jack (= shorting the ring and sleeve of the female jack)?did you check your cable with a resistance meter, to check what is connected with what, and checking if there are no unwanted connections made...?I assume you did it right, - so why doesn't it work?!I ordered a dedicated mono-jack-to-stereo-female adapter - one as was suggested above ..

However, with that setup you cannot send MIDI from Logic to the Nord Drum.If you want to record (via MIDI, not audio) your playing on the PercPad, this will only be possible if the Nord Drum 'echos' incoming MIDI messages to the MIDI out port (like a MIDI thru port). No idea if the Nord Drum does that, but I think that in your current setup Logic only receives MIDI messages when you turn a knob or press a button on the Nord Drum.The best setup might be to connect MIDI out on the PercPad to your computer; then also connect the MIDI in port on the Nord Drum (but preferably also the MIDI out port) to your computer. Logic can then see your drumming on the PercPad and it can control the Nord Drum, so it can send the MIDI messages you generate when playing on the PercPad to the Nord Drum, but it can also send (MIDI) recordings to the Nord Drum.I hope this makes sense. If you only connect MIDI out on the PercPad and MIDI in on the Nord Drum, you can do it with your existing MIDI-to-USB cable. Also connecting MIDI out on the Nord Drum to Logic has the advantage of being able to record knob twiddling on the Nord Drum, but loosing that may not really be an issue for you.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=31098&sid=57c32e33c0e7de016562cfb26ad7cb08#p31098

Either way, I can't get the rim zone to work properly, and striking directly on the pad triggers both channels that I have the drum hooked up to.Also, I jacked with all the Threshold/Sensitivity/Trigger settings and I don't see a way to reset the factory defaults - any ideas there?JoeHello Joe,Even though each of the 4 trigger inputs of the Nord Drum (ND) will function with either TRS or TS connectors, they are only single inputs.The TRS to 2 X TS adapter won't work unless wired correctly.The head piezo polarity is opposite that of the rim piezo.(this will cause triggering issues)V_Drum_TRS.JPG (10.08 KiB) Viewed 6507 timesPage 6 of themanualhas information on how to change the input(s) sensitivity.Cheers, Hanon",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=15581&sid=57c32e33c0e7de016562cfb26ad7cb08#p15581

As it is, all three elements, Tone, Noise, and Attack, all start the moment the sound is triggered.- How about allowing me to change the start times in milliseconds? Tone and Attack start at 0, noise starts at 480ms?2) A couple of more oscillators per voice... A long tones decay will disappear when the sound is retriggered- While this can make for some interesting sounds, I'd like to have the option to turn this off or on at my discretion.3) Velocity Scaling... At this time strike velocity does modulate some parameters in the ND: sweep, punch, filter, depending on the element in question.- I'd like the ability to change how velocity affects the parameter. It seems as if more velocity = higher value sent to said parameter. Let me affect the Tone sweep in the last 30% of the velocity range while having it negatively affect the Noise filter while having the Tone Bend affected by the last 50% of velocity.

Well, now when I finaly got mine - german Thomann is selling it for 199 euros! - I begin to really appreciate this little machine. Ok, still I feel it has its limitations (this single output and just four channels) but I also think that this simplicity is also its power. More features, bigger machine, bigger price. Workflow is just marvelous! In studio use you can of course take out those sounds individually and mix them afterwards.Why I have changed my mind? Well, It is much about value for price. Still I am not sure if it's worth 400 euros or more but for sure for 199 euros it's really winner! Three things matter most to me: 1. Sound quality: perfect. It fits greatly to my studio rig with some very professional synths. 2. Workflow: programming is just fast and simple. You'll get what you want much faster than messing around with sample libraries for example, 3. Playability: it has great dynamics and feel.

I would have LOVED to see a Nord sample library section dedicated to various real sounding drum kits and cymbals that have been meticulously sampled by the Nord team. Maybe even add the existing synthesized section that is the Nord Drum mixed with sample library type drum sounds...something like a Nord Wave drum where you can mix synthesized drums with authentic sounding samples creating something altogether new. Maybe even add an effects and amp section.Also I really feel as though the Nord Drum should have atleast 8 sound inputs instead of 4...Nord Drum EX?I can practically already achieve what the Nord Drum is by hooking up my existing Yamaha electronic drums via midi to my Nord Lead 2x rack drum presets.If they could make a Nord Drum module that could do all of the above I think it would be game over for Roland and Yamaha electronic drums. I do like what the former Ddrum team is doing over at 2Box,but their hardware is flimsy and it is not available in the USA. If Nord just put out a great drum module that was compatible with all rubber,mesh type drum triggers then they wouldn't even need to make a drum rack and pads thus keeping cost down.Sorry if this post is long winded,but I would just really like to see a great next generation Nord drum module with sample library type sounds somewhere in the near future.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=12084&sid=57c32e33c0e7de016562cfb26ad7cb08#p12084

I am going to order one as soon as I know the price from my store. I am not normally an early adopter. I waited about 6 months to buy the wavedrum and I love it but the features of the Nord drum and the fact that it is a Nord puts me more at ease so I'm hopping into this beast just as soon as I can get it! Really the only product from NAMM I am excited about!I see they used Roland pads any other quality pads I should look at?

Kind of surprised this module hasn't generated more talk. I was a bit Leary at first but with more demo vids and having listens on some better speakers I'm convinced they will be a total blast! I hope they sell well enough to cause Nord to go further with the line. Doesn't bother me one bit thinking mine could be replaced in 6 months. I just get more excited thinking of the possibilities for the next models! Thanks for the reply!
