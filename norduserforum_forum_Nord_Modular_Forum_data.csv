If its a power supply issue, most likely culprit would be issue with the capacitors.I'll be poking around inside my unit today and will let you know what I find...However, as a hep to the wider community, if someone could do an EPROM bin file dump of anything from v1.01 to v3.03 that would enable replacement of faulty EPROMs, that would be amazing.Steve",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=169788&sid=133284551d98450c4022f30a95c2a16e#p169788

Compilers change, operating systems change internally, some needed functionality can become deprecated.

Then, copy the first note on a second track and drag it rightward so that it overlaps both the first and second note. Finally, align the copied note more precisely so that its phase matches with the first note. If the phase then also matches with the second note the oscillator is probably free running, but you should have a third and fourth notes recorded to be certain, since random phase can randomly appear to be free running.The above does not necessarily apply with polyphonic synthesizers that cycle through the voices, in which case the testing is a little more difficult. You could first record a long reference note on a second track and then see if the phase of repeated notes matches consistently between every nth note. I doubt this is true of the Nord Modular.If the waveform starts at the same position each time, then it is fixed phase.By repeated notes I mean that you play for example C4, release, hit C4 again, release. Higher pitches like the C4 work fine. So then for free running oscillator the cycle just goes on and on, only the amplitude is set to zero during silence, but the oscillator keeps running.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=176627&sid=133284551d98450c4022f30a95c2a16e#p176627

Few days ago I switched the synth on and it not started - all leds and displays are shining, no welcome message, no system booting, no sound, no response for any button.It looks like system is not booting or main processor not working, only the panel board is under power due to its shining (but not properly initialized and controlled) displays and all those leds. I checked the USB connection and it is silent, so my computer cannot find the device to try e.g. re-flash the OS using official update utility.I tried to disconnect everything and use another power socket, switch the power on and off several times, but no change. I opened the enclosure and checked that nothing is visually damaged or burned out and that all cables are correctly connected to the main board - no problem found. I also removed the expansion board, but without any effect.Using multimeter I tested the power supply board and all output voltages seems to be in tolerance (+11,95 and -11,96 volts, 4,97 volts and 3,278 volts), so the supply is probably still correctly powering the main board. No suspicious bulging capacitor found. The U25 regulator near the power connector at the main board seems to be ok as well (1,77 volts at its output). Unfortunately I don't have oscilloscope or better probe to do some more precise tests or any other checks...I don't know about any service manual for G2 or instructions if there is some self-test or system reset e.g. with holding some buttons during powering up. I reported this problem to official Clavia support, but no response yet.

Use the Editor to make a total backup of all patches and performance in your unit. You need to save everything on your computer hard drive. And do not forget to verify that these backups can actually be loaded back to the G2 after you have saved them.2. When you are certain that you have backups and copies of all your important files, we want you to erase all the content of the G2 flash memory. Here is how to do this:a. Shut down the G2 and then hold the Performance Mode, Display Mode and Store buttons while you power the unit up. Keep holding until the G2 Testprg is visible in the display.b. The lower line in the display will show: MNB - PNL - EXP and SYS. Press the Keyboard Assign D button to enter the SYS tests .c. Use the right arrow navigator button to scroll to the ERASE FFS action. This is an eraser for the flash memory, and when activated will format the entire flash. Every program, patch and performance will be erased in the G2.d. Press the A button to ""run"" the eraser.or (it depend on your g2 hardware version)You start the process by pressing: Shift, Patch Load, Store and Patch Settings, 4 buttons at the same time.e. When this is completed, turn off the G2 and then back on. Reload your programs and try saving again.If this was not successful, do it again but select the ERASE ALL which is found after the ERASE FFS option. This will force you to reload the OS, I would go for the 1.6 first. If this still produces errors, downgrade to 1.4.

Since it causes the keyboard to glitch out (screens all go black or blank) I would say it's on the main motherboard with the CPU and DSP chips.

BTW the Access Virus only has a different CPU. I wouldn't be afraid to bet that the Lead's and Electro's use the same chips as well, perhaps  with here and there more or less memory and a different way of processing (Guess the Electro and Stage use DMA to access the memory - sample data) and the Lead/G2 perhpas not.  No one seems to open up the newer products anymore so maybe Markus could give a helping hand here.to see what is going on in those newer boxes like the NE3/4/5 and the NL 2/3/4/A1.The Freescale is 32 bit and allows up to 4GB memory. Based on the specification it looks like the NS2 has about 1.5GB and the NE5 around 2GB. That should mean there might be some space left for expension to 4GB to create a 4 instruments multiti-timbral NE5R (Rack), perhaps with less voice count per instrument or for example 1 Piano and 3 samples based instruments (Clavia please ?)Anyhow, back to the G2. The bottom line is that component availability wise, these Cirrus and Freescale parts are readily availalble. So can't really get my head around why it would not be possible for re-release the G2, at least the rack version (with expansion card standard), unlessthe Freescale CPU and DSP reach their EOL status soon, but that could affect the whole range of current Clavia products and cause the Nord, as well as all Access Virus products, go belly up. So that should be very much unlikely in the short term.So far for speculation.Just almost put my money down on a 2nd (or whatever counts of ""hands"") G2 for 2 grand on ebay, but then told myself it could break down any moment from old age.Looking at Markus video and the condition/looking of 2nd hand G2's the only reason to buy a G2 would be a form of GAS, We'll that's just me.So, I have put my money on an Axoloti. This a ARM M4 with a ADC only, so no DSP, it it will have to do all the heavy loading of the arithmatic, but it allows to play around and getting into some programming of the processor code as well and into modular  somehow, that must be fun.[Wonder if placing some analog stuff like a VCA or VCF and EG after the DAC would be fun to make a kind of hybrid analog/digital synth], A crazy idea, yes.We'll see and time will tell... the possibilities are endless.Never say never.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=52359&sid=133284551d98450c4022f30a95c2a16e#p52359

For 4 parts it would mean 4 sets of patch connectors, that would be hard to fit in a 3/4U module. Maybe it could be an external patch rack I/O module, like what existed for the Voyager rack (obsolete now).  A single/dual voice, 4 parts true analog module and by putting multiple amplifiers and filter in serial and parallel would be my dream.  A set of 3 to 4 system1m/Mother32 is now about equal to the cost of a 4R rack and I am wondering if one really needs so much polyphony from a lead. (Leads are then just more space efficient) Just trying to say that the cost of true or very close to analog has come down a lot, these modules having much more patch connection options  than the Leads and now have become available as sub-modular (patch-able) rack form factors.  That could stir the end, after the Electro racks   [ something I really want, even without the knobs, just CC/Sysex only by using an external hard or software controller but  also  heavily downplayed as useful in the Electro forum) ] for demand of Lead racks, also because Leads are VA and people are more looking for analog these days. I would agree with you that Clavia may give modular a 2nd thought by pulling the old tech out of closet or innovating on it (or make it open hardware/software if they really never want to look at it again as they said) but it might be tough to ask a high price for it. Anyhow, I am preparing my 19"" rack for Eurorack sized (sub/hybrid)-synhthesizer/modules now as I am hoping and expecting the next step to be multi-timbral (part) (semi)-analog rack mount devices..I could be very wrong.

Polyphony is limited by DSP capacity.  The expansion card doubles polyphony by doubling DSP.  Individual slots do not get individual polyphony limits, the instrument's limits affect ALL slots.  Try this: clear ALL slots of everything (ctrl+A will select everything, then hit delete), then load the awesome ChOrgan program and see what polyphony you get.  Then start loading individual programs to the other slots, one at a time, and watch your ChOrgan polyphony decrease each time.  This is normal behavior.bless, PabloPS -- the G2 was already discontinued by the time this forum was created.  You will note that the activity in the Modular section of this forum receives MUCH less attention than any other.

I think it is because the Welcome G2 sustains for so long.   I had been under the impression that in the editor, you would see a maxing out of DSP, but when you actually got the sounds into the G2 hardware, you could play without danger of the sound dropping to nothing.  I just expected that when the number of voices exceeded the max polyphony, the first voice only would drop out, not all of them!This forum, however, is where I fell in love before I bought my first Nord, the Electro 3, so it is dear to my heart.

I have experienced frequent ""lock-up"" of my G2Es, where reboot is required.  When this happens the midi indicator light is frozen on.  The suspect there has been the midi feed into the Engine, not the engine itself, but a cause was never pinned down with any certainty.  There have been slight changes in the midi data feed and the problem seems to have quieted, but then again I'm not gigging as much anymore, so perhaps that's why I don't see it so much.Also agreed that the plastic piece does appear to be some sort of stand off, but...I sure don't recall ever having seen anything like it in any Nord instrument.  I've refurbed a pair of G2X's, been in and out of a pair of G2s and also my engines.  Does not look like anything from keybed either.  That piece is a complete mystery to me...I'd be more concerned about the total loss of sound after 30 seconds in some playing situations than the mystery bit of plastic...hard to give up a G2 once you've landed one, but you sure don't want to inherit someone else's problems...bless, pabloPS -- I am your tech support rep.

Use a Powered USB HubAfter hours of fiddling with drivers to get my G2 to connect to my laptop (an HP TouchSmart Elitebook), I realized that it won't connect properly unless it's plugged in through my powered USB hub. My guess is that the laptop doesn't provide enough current to the USB ports natively (even when the laptop is plugged into a power supply). Try this if you've installed the right drivers and get an error message saying USB device not recognized or could not connect properly. This is the exact error code I get when looking at the driver properties in Device manager: ""This device cannot start. (Code 10) A request for the USB device descriptor failed.""2. Download and use the Clavia driver 3.02.4, NOT 2.16 (which is still the one listed on the Modular G2 page)You'll have to go to one of the newer Clavia synth downloads pages to get this. I went to the Nord Lead 4 (such a sad downgrade from the G2X) here:http://www.nordkeyboards.com/downloads/ ... ord-lead-4I've also attached the zipped files here.I'll also note that the Clavia Modular G2 editor software runs fine on my Windows 10 machine without having to be in Windows 95 or other compatibility modes, but this doesn't seem to be the case foe everyone. It likely has to do with what service pack you're on or other updates.I hope this helps any other Nord Modular lovers out there frustrated by the EOL issues and maybe quell the general sense of abandonment by Clavia-Samwise",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=98849&sid=bf439c7d13be2cdd5bd3ae0fbeba1882#p98849

By ""voice card"" are you referring to the mainboard?  Those are not replaced, but repaired.  Generally speaking, when something goes wrong electronically ""under the hood"" of ANY electronic instrument, your interests (and those of the instrument, too!) will be best served by having a competent tech inspect it.It is of course possible that there is some component failure somewhere.  It may be that age and oxidation have taken their toll on internal connections, so cleaning is usually a good idea, but this too should be left to a pro.And NO, I am not getting rid of any expansion boards.  Each is installed in a G2 of one variety or another.  I wouldn't dream of castrating one of them in this manner.

I returned the original DSP board and got a replacement, which seemed to fix the issue for a while but then it came back. I took my nord to a clavia-recommended keyboard tech for repairs twice but the issue persisted.Sometimes I could get it to start working again by turning it on and off abour10-20 times, but the issue got more frequent and I ended up having to do this on stage at a gig (not a good time).The other day, the synth would not boot properly no matter how many times I powered it on. I removed the expansion board and viola! It booted up perfectly and has been booting fine ever since. I don't want to slander Encore Electronics but I think there is an issue with their G2 expansion boards. I've also tried every version of firmware as well as wiping the firmware and reinstalling it but it doesn't seem to fix anything. I think some of the code in the chipset on the Encore expansion board sometimes causes the Nord to crash and start the boot cycle again, which gets it stuck in an infinite loop. I'm going to bring this up with Encore and respond with their reply.Thanks,Sam",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=96623&sid=bf439c7d13be2cdd5bd3ae0fbeba1882#p96623

For a non keyboard player, I'm surprised you are looking for this particular one.

Except all that, same as the...- G2: 37 keys, i.e. about 21-22 inches long(65-70 cm), the keyboard is really nice to play. 6-7 kg only, really portative. The extension board may be installed on some used market models. I've owned one for 10+ years now. This is one of the instruments I cannot part with.- G2 Engine: 1 unit 19"" rack, i.e. even lighter. If you don't care about using a MIDI controller, that may be your instrument.For all three, the software editor is the same and will allow you to design your synths and patch them. Controller allocation can be performed from the editor as well as from the G2/G2X. Not sure a G2 Engine + MIDI controller combo can do this.I'm not sure where is the best place to find one. All I an tell is that in France (say in Europe), the prices right now are:- G2X: around Eur1500-1600- G2: around Eur800-1000 without extension board and Eur1000-1300 with it.- G2 Engine: no ads since a while in France...BTW the old Modular series may interest you as well, maybe the MicroModular will satisfy you",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=84893&sid=bf439c7d13be2cdd5bd3ae0fbeba1882#p84893

Instead of replacing them with the correct SMD part (pretty hard to do without the right equipment or at least a healthy dose of patience), it seems they created a botch repair with some diodes. Given enough of a zap, that's not going to keep your electronics from getting friend. What the cap does in that picture isn't clear to me. Looking at the schematics for the Nord Elecro 2 might clear that up (I think their from about the same time, so might have a similar layout - at least the PSU does). You should get this fixed; I can imagine this has some impact on the sound quality for that output too, as these diodes are in the signal path between the DAC and the jacks.The capacitor in the power supply is an attempt to prevent drop-outs on the 3.3 volt line of the power supply (which could lead to crashes). My Nord Rack 3 also suffers somewhat from that and I've thought about doing something similar. I wouldn't worry too much about this mod, but do check if the capacitor is glued down to the circuit board; the weight of that capacitor shouldn't be borne by those (fairly feeble looking) solder joints.I haven't had any experience with companies doing repairs on Nords myself, but you might want to check they'll actually be able to (or want to) replace those SMD components. I'm not sure if this is true, but I could imagine they generally don't do stuff like this. You might want to contact them and send them these pictures, so they know what the damage is and what needs to be done. Maybe you need to go looking for someone that is experienced in (and has the right skills/equipment for) doing repairs on prints with SMD components. Getting similarly specced replacements for those filters shouldn't be a big issue and the manual labor would make up the bulk of the costs.While some 'synth doctors' (I mean the guys repairing 30-40 year old synths) might do excellent work on newer stuff, I think they're generally used to working on older synths (larger components, only through-hole stuff). While they may need to get creative on a 40 year old Moog (because parts can't be found anymore, etc) it would be nice if your (fairly new, relatively speaking) Nord could be repaired with equivalent parts.Of course, this Nord is still in better condition than one with only a single working output",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=31971&sid=bf439c7d13be2cdd5bd3ae0fbeba1882#p31971

You could go to a 150 mA one, but I wouldn't go to a heavier one than that. In your case I'd say something is really wrong, perhaps a short-circuit as you suspect.This is really not good.Are you going to try to figure this out yourself? If so, realize you can make it much, much worse. If you are, I'd start by figuring out if the power supply itself is at fault. You could disconnect the ribbon cable between the mainboard on the left and the power supply on the right. If your fuse still blows, the power supply must be at fault (I hope that's the case); if not there is likely a short somewhere on the mainboard. With a good multimeter, you might be able to pinpoint the short by measuring the resistance between the power rails (5V and 3.3V) but this is quite a lot of work. If you have some knowledge of electronics, you'll have an idea of the likely suspect components (I'd start with the bodge repairs).Edit: don't start measuring in your Nord when the power cord is plugged in!! DANGER WILL ROBINSON. Unless you know what you're doing, you could electrocute yourself.To be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if a repair shop (in general) will try convince you it (very likely) cannot be repaired; there's a good chance this is outside of what they consider repairable. Note that I didn't say 'it cannot be repaired'. As long as the (repeated) short-circuits didn't cause additional damage, there's still (some) hope but I would keep in mind what fixing it is worth to you. If it turns out the power supply is at fault, you have more options and things look better (though there may still be damage to the mainboard); a different (new or refurbished) power supply would be the easiest option, though repairing the power supply would likely also be possible (since the power supply is much simpler than the mainboard).Clabia wrote:PS: I tried to contact the Clavia Nord Technician Support but nobody replied, quite strange and didn´t find any e-mail, well if somebody knows i´d appreciate.In most counties tech support is done via the distributor for that country. At the top-right of the Clavia/Nord site you can find a link called Distributors which links to a page with  all distributors; it should list the details for the distributor in your country.Or did you mean you contacted your distributor? If you contacted Clavia themselves, there's a very good chance they sent your request on to the distributor, who should then contact you. I'd prefer it if Clavia would inform users of this, but appearently they don't. At least this is what I understood, but I could be wrong.If you did contact the distributor, I would try again (maybe call them?) and if you still don't get any response, contact Clavia andlet them know you tried contacting the distributor for your country, but got no response.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=32017&sid=bf439c7d13be2cdd5bd3ae0fbeba1882#p32017

I have double gigs today, and another gig early tomorrow afternoon, but will check it out tomorrow evening and let you know what I see.Regarding the support inquiry submissions to Nord's website, MJ is correct -- support inquiries submitted to the Nord website are auto-forwarded to the individual responsible for handling tech support in the country from which the incoming email originated.  The Nord Crew reads them all just so that they can know what is going on and step in for unusual cases, but will generally sit back and allow the national tech support to step up and handle it (as they are supposed to do).  This will be one of those situation in which YMMV.Ultimately, if the electronics need professional attention you will need to find someone competent to the task.  If you find no one in Portugal to handle that for you, the folks in Stockholm can certainly handle it.  Their labor rates are extremely competitive when compared to what folks are used to paying over here in the USA.  Shipping costs from USA are crazy expensive, though; perhaps this is not so terrible from Portugal.More tomorrow...PabloP.S. -- Please note that the amazing Variation feature of the G2 platform is now being resurrected in the Lead 4, except with a new twist: it's momentary.

There may be a newer version of the board that they started producing which does away with this unsightly thing, but I'm not sure.From the fact that your fuse is being blown, I'd say the issue is most likely on the power supply board on the right, maybe a short past one of the resistors.

Currently I own a nord modular G1 rack (not expanded) and a micromodular. I'm absolutely in love with these synths. I use the G1 as a proper synth and the MM as an effects unit, usually. I'm thinking of getting the expansion board from encore electronics (while they last!) and I also plan at some point to get a G2..or a G2x, if I get lucky enough.My question is, would you go for the expansion board of the G1 OR for a second G1 altogether? Money is not an issue although it is an important factor to take into account.On the one hand an expansion board is the simpler and cheaper solution, on the other hand a second G1 is more expensive and will need more space to fit in my studio, but it will have overall similar results as if I had gotten the expansion board plus i will get to have 8 outs instead of 4. Also the expansion board will be new while a second G1 used. My goal is to be able to use as many complex sounds as possible. Or should I simply just plan better my dsp allocation & make more efficient patches and get nothing?Not that I don't try that but...Thank you!Mario",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=76631&sid=bf439c7d13be2cdd5bd3ae0fbeba1882#p76631

If you do, that goy (or girl) could probably test if it is the power supply that went bad. If it did, they can probably pin point the component that went bad (probably a capacitor).

If you went from 230 to 120 volt, you might've blown the fuse (but then the display wouldn't light up) or have damaged the power supply - the Nords do not automatically switch between 120 and 230 volt though this can be done manually. However, you seem to be living in Portugal, so it doesn't look like this is the case.I think the power supply should work fine with 220, 230 and probably even 240 volt.The power supply produces a number of voltages: +3.3V, -5V, +5V, -12V and +12V. Those could be checked with a multimeter. Ideally, someone would also check these power lines for glitches (dips, ripple, etc). The +/-12V is used by the output amplifiers, the +-/5V by the DAC and the electronics are running on 3.3 and 5 volt. I think the display is running of the 5V line, but it might also be 3.3. The microprocessor is running off the 5V line.While the power supply of your modular will likely not be exactly the same, the last page of the document linked below might be interesting for the person checking out the power supply. I do expect your power supply to be fairly similar (maybe other voltage regulators, etc).http://www.workhousepoets.com/NE2%20Ser ... matics.pdfOne thing you could still do yourself is check and/or replace the fuse. Since the display is lighting up it seems okay, but if you could measure it's resistance (multimeter) or replace it (300 mA slow-blow fuse for 120V, 125 mA slow-blow for 230V) that would be good. If you can't get the exact value, you could get one slightly 'larger' (i.e. 150 mA instead of 125). The physical size is likely 5x30 mm, but it might also be 6x32 mm. The opening of the fuse holder can be seen on the back of your Nord, next to the power supply connector. You probably have the type where you use a flat-headed screwdriver to open it. I think you need to turn it counter-clockwise and you definitely do not have to use a lot of force. You might have to push on the screwdriver a bit while you're turning it. It is not that likely to be an issue with the fuse though, so you might as well skip this.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=26918&sid=36a824c584c06d68e4d75958ac4d74d6#p26918

Likely the only reason this chip is involved is that someone wanted a source of +5 volts. It is possible that the PCB trace to the Vcc pin on that chip is damaged (or otherwise less than ideal), but then I would think the wire wouldn't be going to R26.The big chip on the left is likely the Freescale (Motorola) ColdFire micro controller (MCU) that controls all the hardware (like the DSPs) in the G2, scans the keyboard and buttons, handles MIDI, etc. R26 is an SMD resistor and the marking 1002 means it is a 10k Ω resistor (first three digits x 10^last digit so 100 x 10^2 = 10,000). This is likely a pull up (or down) resistor for a floating in- or output on the MCU (ColdFire).If R26 is connected to an input (on the left side), one goal may have been to prevent that input from ever seeing a low signal by connecting +5v directly to it. If R26 is indeed a pull up resistor (and the contact on the right is also always at +5 volts), they could also have replaced R26 with some solder (to create a bridge). If R26 is connected to a pin that is used as an output, I see two options; if the right contact on R26 is at +5 volts, then the pin R26 is connected to a current sink that tries to pull the signal low or if the right contact on R26 is at 0 volt, it is likely a current source.To summarize this bla bla, I can say I think that the chip is an 'innocent bystander' and that R26 is either connected to an in- or output. The question is: what?I think it is best to cover the bare end (b) with some tape for now, so it cannot touch anything else in there and put +5 volts on it which might even cause a short circuit (hopefully the fuse would pop before that happens though). This may be some kind of factory mod that came loose, but I don't expect it to be because I would've expected it to be done in a more proper way that doesn't put any mechanical stress on the solder joints (i.e. by affixing the wire to the PCB or some sturdy component with some glue).If it turns out it is indeed some custom mod someone did, I would personally just snip off the wire near point A and not even desolder it.I think you should take care of that bare wire end, but since it otherwise seems to be working fine, don't mess with it any further.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=38928&sid=36a824c584c06d68e4d75958ac4d74d6#p38928

I'm assuming here that your fingers are used to much heavier keys and make short work of the Modular's unweighted keyboardI can imagine you'd get used to it; maybe you could just connect it to your Stage 2 and use your Stage's keyboard.You could connect a computer to it with a MIDI interface and you could see (using a program like MIDI Monitor on the Mac or MIDI-OX on Windows) the velocity you get when you press a key. Press multiple keys with what (for you) seems the same force and see if you get roughly equal velocities. If you get similar velocities, I doubt there's anything wrong with the keyboard. If a few keys give values that are way off it might need some TLC.I haven't checked, but I assume the 'small' Modulars (3 octaves?) have unweighted keyboards. The 'large' ones (like the G2X, 5 octave) might have a better keybed (perhaps semi-weighted with aftertouch?) but again I haven't checked.

If it just uses USB, I think it would work fine if you assign that USB port to Windows XP. If it's MIDI, I'd use a MIDI interface that isn't shared with OSX (at the time of editing) and is connected via USB, so you can again give XP full control over that.I think you can share OSX's MIDI interface with XP so they could theoretically use it at the same time, but I have some doubts about how well that would work.Personally I use Parallels to run both Windows XP and Windows 7 on my Mac and assigning USB devices exclusively to the virtual machines has always worked problem free for me. For example, I do that with the USB dongle/interface for my RC helicopter simulator (http://www.phoenix-sim.com/).Chris Ghost wrote:2. What is the correct set up for the midi?

The Saffire probably uses a Firewire connection, right?You could also get a cheap MIDI-over-USB cable; would probably only cost you 15 euro.I imagine you can send patches to the NM1 using Sysex messages from a sequencer, but Live 8 didn't support Sysex and I think 9 also doesn't (Logic Pro 9 does though).Chris Ghost wrote:If I understand it right, I need to connect the PC in and out to the Saffire out and in Midi Ports.

If you have the Remote SL send MIDI directly to the NM1 (also possible), Live won't be in the loop which will give you a less flexible setup (though latency will be a bit lower).Anyway, feel free to ask more MIDI related questions.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=31698&sid=36a824c584c06d68e4d75958ac4d74d6#p31698

Maybe any admin an work this out.I guess you have to use a ""PITCH SHIFT"" module - sorry, I can't remind the exact name but not a ""freq shift"", whose frequency will be controlled thanks to a sequencer module. I don't remember whether the pitch shift module has a modulation input for its frequency though, but I guess it has.Second step is to program your patterns in the sequencer. I don't know if it's better to have as many variations as different patterns or as many sequencers modules in you patch. The point is you will have to trigger the change of pattern yourself, say using a fottswitch. And I'm not sure it's possible to tell a patch to change the variation. You could do it through a MIDI message, though.Good luck!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=28447&sid=36a824c584c06d68e4d75958ac4d74d6#p28447

Eather way i should get an interesting result, but  he other problem is that i want to activate the first sequencer by en external trigger so it doesnt start on its own so that way i have time to make sure my guitar is working properly before a perfomance.

I have a cheap USB to MIDI converter, hooked to a Mac (OS X10.7.5). For software I tried Nomad 0.3.02 as well as the Nord Modular Editor OSX BETA. I also have tried windows 7 with some editor program on the same laptop, yet i dont remember the name of the editor.  I even grabbed an old G4 Macbook and tried to install the old Nord Modular hqx file, to no avail...When i connect the MIDI cables to the MIDI in and out ports of the NM, i can play notes from the Mac, and the ""Audio-Midi-Setup""-Program shows its all ok.But i constantly fail doing anything through NM's MIDI ports named ""PC in and out"".The LED on the MidiBox is flickering, indicating there is constant data transferred to the PC.The NM does not show up in any of the programs,  and i cannot up- or download patches.Does anybody have any help on that subject? Any caveats, maybe a newbie primer to start with?I also tried an (in OS X) old Unitor 8 Midi Box, and a Hammerfall multiface Firewire i/O box, but couldnt' get those damn Mac drivers to work.BTW:is it possibleAFTER ALLto load patches from the NM to the PC in order to edit, and understand them?My final goal is  to use the NM as a ""playable"" effect, by altering the input signals. The audio setup is fine, no questions on that. I have found that some of the patches stored in the NM are using the Input signals, and I was able to integrate the NM into my audio setup.Any help would be appreciated!Dirk",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=25673&sid=36a824c584c06d68e4d75958ac4d74d6#p25673

It is a metal strip with a pressure sensitive strip on it. Bending it generates those values.I don't think you can calibrate your pitch stick, but I'm not completely sure. Maybe some tech guy with the right info (from Clavia) might be able to. However, these things do wear down with use and need to be replaced after a they've seen a lot of use.I'd contact the distributor for Nord products in the UK - they can advise you on how to proceed. There's a link to the distributors near the top-right when viewing the Nord website. You can also contact Clavia via the support form on the Nord website; they'll either answer your question or send it on to the appropriate distributor, in case they think the distributor is better equiped to help you.The post below has some nice pictures of the pitch stick.http://www.norduserforum.com/nord-stage ... t2897.html",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=24386&sid=36a824c584c06d68e4d75958ac4d74d6#p24386

When played with the base pitch of the tone moving upward or downward, it is referred to as the Shepard scale. This creates the auditory illusion of a tone that continually ascends or descends in pitch, yet which ultimately seems to get no higher or lower.It has been described as a ""sonic barber's pole"". The acoustical illusion can be constructed by creating a series of overlapping ascending or descending scales.Boolean logic, originally developed by George Boole in the mid 1800s, allows quite a few unexpected things to be mapped into bits and bytes.The great thing about Boolean logic is that, Boolean logic is very simple.Logic Gates: NOT, AND, OR. And combinations with these three to create: XOR, NAND, NOR and XNOR.With these simple gates you can build combinations that will implement any digital component you can imagine.I combined these two in an interactive and informative article to show you a bit more logic fun:http://www.rolandkuit.com/Research.html",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=24310&sid=36a824c584c06d68e4d75958ac4d74d6#p24310

Students of these techniques do not need to own a Nord to partake of these lessons thanks to the G2 Demo freeware provided by Nord, but for G2 owners SoundLab II represents a mind-boggling treasure trove of assorted building blocks illustrating various strategies for sound generation and control.“This eBook is not for low level users,” page one warns; Dante’s “Beware all ye who enter here” would be more appropriate. Seriously twisted combinations of modules abound and Roland seems to take special delight in demonstrating how to create/manipulate sound in new and obscure ways. LFOs coupled to flip-flop logic circuits become sequencers, homemade filters are cobbled together using miscellaneous bits and pieces, and the results are usually more conservative of CPU resources, and certainly more versatile, than using the ordinary stock sequencing or filtering modules.As with SoundLab I, each and every example in the book is represented by a patch screenshot which has been hyperlinked to the actual patch file for convenient download. Just teach your computer to associate the .pch2 file format with Nord’s G2 Demo freeware, and auditioning patch examples is a breeze. Well, almost a breeze....with more than 720 programming examples provided, spending only two minutes with each one will consume a full 24-hr day out of one’s life! Trust me, students of SoundLab II will be losing much sleep while staying up late immersing themselves in the complex world of colored-cable tapestries woven by Mr. Kuit.Seriously, this is Ph.D.-level work and deserves to be recognized as such. There is little doubt in my mind that the Board of Regents for Nord University will be awarding Roland Kuit an honorary doctorate along with tenured Professor Emeritus status for this milestone contribution to the world of G2 synthesis.It should be added that the SoundLab II examples are primarily created for educational/illustrative purposes and are not intended to provide unsophisticated users with easy, color-by-number short-cuts for creating programs. Serious study of these things will require serious time and thought investment, and a thorough understanding of SoundLab I...no pain, no gain.Pablo Mastodon",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=17421&sid=36a824c584c06d68e4d75958ac4d74d6#p17421

By opening the first Chapters in SoundLab I, I found myself completely involved and Roland Kuit helped me a lot in this way. The Clavia software and Roland's patches gave me awareness that were very far from my synthesis point of view. He deeply explains all kind of physical synthesis from basic subtractive, passing through additive, granular, wavetable, formant and very much more. And all the sections are logically structured so you will be able to follow a logical path through the chapters.By moving and connecting the various modules, already meticulously assembled by Roland himself, I'm free to plan and program my next patch, and this inspiration is translated in the original analogue world.As I started my very first modular system some months ago I based my purchases on the knowledge achieved through this eBooks. And if you are so lucky to own a real Clavia Nord Modular G2, the possibilities are unlimited. I've been constructing new patches and modify Roland's patches since 2 years now and the results are always new and fresh to my hears.I personally love most the sequencer pattern section, and copy and past some of the oscillators to combine extreme sequencing. But this is applied for me for almost all the sections of these amazing eBooks.I recommend both SoundLab I & II as for me were a turning point for my productions.First contact from labels comes a lot thanks to study SoundLab I and SoundLab II.The SoundLab II is completing SoundLab I, giving more specification to single chapters and new insights.Focusing on different and new aspects of patterns and sequencers. In the chapter Logic, Roland is going 3D!!Amazing logic structures unfolding to my eyes and ears.Chapter Audio processing is mindblowing too. Audio mangling you can't find in the stores. Stunning DIY made pattern controlled reverbs/echo's, you name it.Slowly trying to gasp it all and wondering if I ever can come back to this world. Trying not to get lost in this galaxy of new possibilities.The reader has now a complete view of synthesis and specifications, this is really essential for all.If you are new to synthesis or already a sound warrior, this ""must have"" flabbergasting eBooks have to be in your personal data with no compromise!Magosh & the Magizhanhttp://www.deradio.ca/deradio/artists/item/5-magosh",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=18191&sid=36a824c584c06d68e4d75958ac4d74d6#p18191
