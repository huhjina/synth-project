Samples are limited for synths because they lack all the functions/controls associated with the synth.I play this tune using my Electro 5D as follows: USB MIDI to a laptop running Mixcraft 9 Pro Studio. Mixcraft is configured to use a Mini Moog VA VST synth that I configured for The Cars - Just What I Needed sound. I run the laptop and Electro into a mixer to allow for separate volume adjustment. I can turn the main volume off on the Electro and the only sound out of the mixer is the Mini Moog. I have a patch configured in the Electro that blends using the volume control for the last part of the song that adds to the Mini Moog.I'll try and sample the sounds from the Mini Moog and see if they sound decent enough to get by without using MIDI.,https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=168171&sid=fa0096fab2f5b61bc7d995af2b6b5056#p168171

The tone ""glides down"" to almost unison with #1 but slightly detuned. ADSR is pretty much what you might use on a flute. The synth should be put in mono mode with maybe a bit of portemento(since the electro can't do this, I can't say for sure if it helps) and then add delay and reverb. Filter to taste.

I received them a couple of days ago. I have tried one of them out so far.He provided me with a continuous Wav. at 48kHz and 16-bit. I had some problems with the file in Cubase (which is not really worth discussing here). Anyway, I loaded the Wav. file directly into the NSE; and within 30 secs it hadslicedall of the hit-points and flawlessly mapped the pitches to the correct notes! Much easier the Cubase, in my experience.Now, a couple of questions if I may, please:When you load a 48kHz Wav. into the NSE, does it RETAIN its 48kHz or is itdumbed downto 44.1kHz?

I will decide if this is really needed, but for effects samples with the glide I assume this is needed. For around 5 seconds at max volume- If the none-glide sample is also needed, make sure to sample them at a fixed level (like 110) just when the glide is not started. I assume the glide will come on at almost max velocity. Every 3th note (c-d#-f#-a-c...) for 5 to 10 seconds. You could set the fixed velocity in the Motif, or use a DAW with midi pattern to sample it.Make sure no effects are applied and even write down the settings for re-creating them.

I downloaded your sample and it sounds like your audio editing software might be doing the same thing mine was doing when I started working on the song for my Stage 3 (see post atpost106398.html#p106398). I had two audio editing programs that were erroneously changing the speed of the playback slightly when I changed the pitch.  Mr_-G- suggested that I download the latest version of Audacity and check the box for pitch correction to ""use high quality stretching"" (see pic below) which fixed the problem. I no longer use the other editing software for any pitch corrections.  Note too that any notes that you don't specifically pitch-correct and depend on a sample on another key will be sped up or slowed downed, so if you want the NSMP file to play in any key, you'll need pitch-corrected samples for all twelve. I hope this helps - good luck to you!Audacity - Change Pitch.jpg (35.89 KiB) Viewed 2548 times",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=151856&sid=d00a25f60b41710eacb16b0b8ccb8ac0#p151856

The first is a generic ""rock organ"" sound for the choruses, and a simple synth patch for the little keyboard riff. Unfortunately, the NE5 doesn't have a synth section, so you'll need to look through the Nord Sample library to try and find something similar. You're looking for a basic pulse-wave patch with a piano-like envelope on it, nothing too fancy. Add a bit of chorus to finish it off.Personally, I also play along with the verse chords with a general chorused piano sound just for something to do.Edit:1. For the organ sound, first select B3 Organ Model.Then switch on the Leslie simulator: select Rotary in the SPKR/COMP part of the Effects section.Add some overdrive buy using the DRVE/COMP knob in the same section. Try setting it between about 3 and 6 to start with.Then set the drawbars to something like 688855000 to start with. If you need it closer, try starting with 6888 and then fiddle with adding some of the higher drawbars to taste.(No VIBRATO/CHORUS or PERCUSSION necessary).Use plenty of Rotary Slow/Fast switching for dramatic effect2. For the Synth sound, try ""Fat Clav"" on this page:http://www.nordkeyboards.com/sound-libr ... -2-0/synthand add some chorus to thicken it up.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=63744&sid=1b42b01eaa63fc197364b8c23e76d965#p63744

Are you looking to emulate a certain kind of piano sound?It seems more rock style players want a cutting sound without too much bottom end. I play jazz, and keep a very warm sound most of the time. I use the Grand Lady D, Concert Grand 2 and Amber Upright most of the time. Even with those, I find myself attenuating the bass depending on the room. Most of the time I play through a single QSC K8, but will bring two on occasion.The Royal Grand, Velvet Grand, Queen Upright and Mellow Upright are all warmer, darker piano samples as well. Other piano samples have much stronger overtone emphasis, and are generally too bright for my taste. The Silver Grand is sort of on the border; it can be rather warm when playing soft, but can really bite as well.What kind of amplification are you running?The amp you use and how you set it up will have just as much impact on the sound as the piano sample.Don't be afraid of the EQ. Even the type of reverb you use will impact the sound. The Rooms are bright and will impact the sound regardless of how low you have reverb in the mix. Try the Stage and Hall settings, and adjust to taste.Also keep in mind that your sound WILL change from room to room. The great thing about the Nord keyboards is they are highly interactive. You do not need to set it and forget it.I recommend that you set up your rig in your home, using your amp and approximating the placement, distance and (if you can) the volume you play at. Tweak as needed to arrive at voicings you feel sound suitable. Try different pianos, including those you wouldn't think are suitable - you may be surprised. Save those programs and write down your EQ and reverb settings. Become familiar with how those parameters impact the sounds. When you get to the rehearsal or gig, be prepared to spend a few minutes tweaking again, as well as making minor adjustments during the first few tunes.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=90478&sid=1b42b01eaa63fc197364b8c23e76d965#p90478

There are plenty of keyboards on the market that provide a heavily processed piano voice that sounds pretty good using mediocre amplification. In the Nord world, the Electric Grands, the Digital Pianos, EPs etc. don't require decent amplification and sound pretty good in my opinion.

When my band did it in the 70's the main portable pianos  available were Wurlitzer or Rhodes. We had a Wurly and the sound had so much growl a bit like a rocky guitar it sounded exiting. When I heard the record I used to think it sounded a bit lame in comparison.  When I use any of the Nord Acoustic pianos I find them a little pure for rock - I know many Nord fans would disagree, fine -  but don't torture yourself too much over it if you're not that enthusiastic - try the un-amped Wurly, or even a Rhodes - I like the Nefertiti - that can growl a bit too!  Yes it could be deemed 'wrong' , but if I was going to do Don't Stop live these days with my Electro 5 I might have to go with that route.

It's a pretty straight ahead sound. Start with one of the Mark I pianos (EP2 Suitcase Close Ideal or EP8 Nefertiti). I would use EP2 myself, as the suitcase sample has the right amount of bite, specially with the new v6 sample. Nefertiti will work as well, but it's a bit grittier.It's a pretty mid-range focused setting, so set your EQ or filter accordingly. It's also fairly dry, so go sparingly with the phaser, pan and/or reverb. I would start the Twin amp sim and just a bit of reverb and no other effect.

Does that make any sense or would it be a complete disaster?I have owned Electro 2 (gone now), Electro 3HP (my 'roadie') and Electro 6HP (for the studio) and that is the only sensible way to go IMHOI would suggest that you carefully audition all the sounds that you might be interested in, download them to a computer directory (in all file sizes...) and start from there. This includes samples. Don't download anything that you don't think you will ever use as it just clutters things up...(although I personally keep a full up-to-date file of all the sounds on my studio server)There is a big tradeoff between the number of different sounds you have on your board and the quality of the sounds. e.g. maybe you need a piano sound...perhaps you can find one piano sound that you like better than the others and can imagine that as ""Your Signature Sound"" for piano and load it at the highest depth. Similarly, do you need all of the Rhodes and Wurli sounds...maybe one Wurli and two Rhodes covers your needs when paired with the onboard effects. Make a spreadsheet of your 'wish list' after listening to the sounds with some priority assessment (e.g. 1-best, 2-good, 3-maybe want) and look carefully at your memory budget. Then use Nord Sound Manager to arrange these sensibly, use ALL your memory wisely in priority order, and then ""don't look back""...just use your first pass for a while. As you get used to what you have chosen and play a bunch, you will change your mind on a few. It's easy to back up your current performance set and subtract/add a few sounds...keep the focus on quality (i.e. high sample definition) for sounds that will be your mainstay and use the lower quality versions for the 'nice to have' sound types (e.g. DX7 piano...)Do the same thing with the Sample Bank...here you have no flexibility with size of files so it is just about choosing the important ones to have in your board.Since I have two boards with differing memory amounts and different utilization, I set them up quite differently.For the Electro 3HP (performance board), I tend to choose a small number of ""Piano Bank"" sounds of the highest quality (i.e. Large)...one grand, one electric grand, one upright, a good set of Rhodes (my performance board used to be my 1973 Fender-Rhodes Stage 73 which now is permanently stationed in the studio), a Wurli or two, a full set of Clavs and that about does it. I review this maybe once a year, but when performing, I have a patch bank for each Voice-Sample Set (i.e. for my grand piano I have a bank with FOUR different patches that include EQ, Reverb, for each Rhodes it is a patch with voice-specific settings for Reverb, Chorus, Phase, and Amp, etc...). That way I know where everything is and I print a table out and tape it to the keyboard so I can just grab the right sound instantly. I keep maybe a dozen organ patches (all 3, Vox, B3, Farfisa). I have a few favorite samples (Fretless bass, some of the classic synths, although I have a few of the actual synths that I occasionally drag) and that's it.For the 6HP, I have a different strategy, since it is always in the studio wired into my DAW and keyboard submixer so it is easy. I generally have 5 or 6 ""Full Sets"" that are backed up and stored, and load whatever is appropriate for the project I'm working on. Some are heavy on 'legit' pianos, some are all about electric pianos, others are about percussion and special effects, and so on. I keep one that is like a general purpose set for practice and jam sessions. My synths mostly live in the studio and I use the same strategy...I manage the ""current patch set"" from software storage...particularly for the big polysynths where I have several 'banks' that I can load up.While this is not 'the answer' to your question, I thought that it might help yourself and others who are new to this question of patch management. The sad thing is that we have to do this at all...I continue to be a bit frustrated with Nord and the stingy amount of memory that they provide. I realize that they use a special design, but it would be nice if they would give us empty slots that we can fill up when we get a little more money!",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=122672&sid=4430caa521a7e082176c186582ad030f#p122672

On early Costello albums such as This Year’s Model and Armed Forces, Nieve was playing classic keyboards like the Polymoog, Jupiter 4, Vox Continental and as some sites have incorrectly documented, a Farfisa organ.“I didn’t use a Farfisa, that’s not true'” he states. “It was always a Vox and I have always liked playing that organ and continue to play it.""https://www.australianmusician.com.au/a ... eve-nieve/",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=116620&sid=4430caa521a7e082176c186582ad030f#p116620

After buying it, the pack downloaded as a .rar file and I quickly found out that Sound Manager does not accept that file type. I then tried using a program, The Unarchiver, on my mac to extract what I could and possibly reconvert the file to something that would work. Then by my luck all it extracted was a png image of the product.With that being said, can anyone point me in the right direction of how to go about possibly getting this .rar file into Sound Manager so I can use it?

Especially the combination for covering the old Dylansong „I shall be released“ was great (I think a combination of an acoustic piano with an EP4 MarkV?) and I thought what a s*** that I don’t have the money to buy a Stage.To play a similar sound on my NE5 I made a Sample of the E-Piano4 Mark V to layer it with the intern acoustic piano and find a fuller and warmer and more floating sound like a pure piano.The sample first didn’t convince me but cranking rather strong and unusual with the EQ (B:8 Freq:546 Gain: - 2,6 Tr: - 13,4/ only for the synth-part!!) and effects (a little bit vibe - eventually very less of Drive)  and with the right balance between both pianos the result for me is not perfect but very satisfying. I choose the silver grand because it cuts through the mix in the trebles. I adjusted the balance so that with a soft attack you hear more of the epiano and with a strong attack more of the brilliance of the acoustic piano is audible. With the Sample you find a NE5-program-file with my adjustments.The mp3- demo starts with the layer, 0:18 only silver grand, 0:28 only EP4 MarkV, 0:38 layer of bothLayer Silver Grand - Mark V.mp3Has anyone of you nsmp- samples of E-pianos which are combinable with acoustic piano or clavinets of the Nord electro.What’s your opinion?

Funny you should mention Moonlight Sonata because I'm trying to learn the first movement right now.  I have no chance of playing the third, I'm afraid.  And this sonata amounts to a trance when you get the timing and accents right.  On the Piano 3, it sounds absolutely fantastic in Royal Grand 3D XL and in Grand Upright XL with a little reverb or delay.  It's harder to get a good piano sound out of the A1, and that's not what I expect out of it, but what I found is that its keyboard isn't up to the task.  You end up on the black keys around the 9th measure and you tend to be pretty far back on them, at least I do.  This doesn't really work on whatever key bed they're using in the A1.  About 20% of the time, it seems, it's dropping key presses until you get back on some white keys.  And without the dampers, missing a note like that breaks the trance rhythm.  I've found it works a little better if I can manage to play forward on the keys, but even then, it's not completely reliable for me.  I do not have this problem on the Piano 3.  I have a used Lead 3 incoming to try and resolve this.  I'm hoping the fact that it had Aftertouch indicates a better key bed was used in it.  However my love affair with the A1 is over.  I've moved onto actively disliking its keyboard intently, which is a bummer because it sounds so wonderful otherwise.  But I don't see the point of keeping something in the studio with a keyboard that's so bad you don't want to play on it.  I also treated myself to a used Rack 3, which is almost everything the A1 is but with much much better ergonomics.",https://www.norduserforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=82983&sid=a1160aef3d3eb4a93fe07f5ca12e5c3e#p82983

That alone will give you hours of exploration time.OR - you could start with what's factory-loaded (plenty) and focus on modifying those sounds. You'll find there are two worlds in Nord - the piano side and the organ side. I would start with an acoustic piano and play with the various controls to see how they change the sound - and then save a few of your favorites as presets. Nord also loads tons of presets which can be educational just to play with and see what controls have been used, and how.  A lot of them can be deleted or over-written - the first ten or so in each of the four banks tend to be more practical.

Maybe because you are searching for an ideal sound that is relativly clear in your mind. So you get always close to it every time. Same for me but in a different way. I used to play years on a german piano that was not well tuned. And now I hate  that kind of sound, like mellow-chorus-upright-piano sound, I have heard it to much.So deep and clear piano sounds is what I like the most.
